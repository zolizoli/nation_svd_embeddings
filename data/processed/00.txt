in dispute between conflict foreign government be interest not less than duty to remain strictly neutral shall not abandon will perceive from the correspondence submit to in connection with this subject that the course adopt in this case have be properly regard by the belligerent power interested in the matter although a minister of the|united|state to the|german|empire be appoint by predecessor in august,|1848 and have for a long time be in attendance at frankfort on the main and although a minister appoint to represent that empire be receive and accredit here yet no such government as that of the|german|empire have be definitively constitute mr. donelson representative at frankfort remain there several|months in the expectation that a union of the|german|state under constitution or form of government may at length be organize be believe by those well acquaint with the exist relation between prussia and the|states|of|germany that no such union can be permanently establish without cooperation in the event of the formation of such a union and the organization of a central power in germany of which should form a part would become necessary to withdraw minister at berlin but while prussia exist as an independent kingdom and diplomatic relation be maintain with there can be no necessity for the continuance of the mission to frankfort have therefore recall mr. donelson and direct the archive of the legation at frankfort to be transfer to the american legation at berlin have be apprise that a considerable number of adventurer be engage in fit out a military expedition within the|united|state against a foreign country and believe from the good information could obtain that be destine to invade the island of cuba deem due to the friendly relation exist

book hold to be the duty of the executive faithfully to obey injunction while this expedition be in progress be inform that a foreigner who claim protection have be clandestinely and as be suppose forcibly carry off in a vessel from new|orleans to the island of cuba immediately cause such step to be take as think necessary in case the information have receive should prove correct to vindicate the honor of the country and the right of every person seek an asylum on soil to the protection of law the person allege to have be abduct be promptly restore and the circumstance of the case be now about to undergo investigation before a judicial tribunal would respectfully suggest that although the crime charge to have be commit in this case be hold odious as be in conflict with opinion on the subject of national sovereignty and personal freedom there be no prohibition of or punishment for provide in any act of congress the expediency of supply this defect in criminal code be therefore recommend to consideration have scrupulously avoid any interference in the war and contention which have recently distract europe during the late conflict between austria and hungary there seem to be a prospect that the latter may become an independent nation however faint that prospect at the time appear think duty in accordance with the general sentiment of the american people who deeply sympathize with the magyar patriot to stand prepared upon the contingency of the establishment by of a permanent government to be the first to welcome independent hungary into the family of nation for this purpose invest an agent then in europe with power to declare willingness promptly to recognize independence in the event of ability to sustain the powerful intervention of russia in the contest extinguish the hope of the struggle magyars the|united|state do not at any time interfere in the contest but the feeling of the nation be strongly enlist in the cause and by the suffering of a brave people who have make a gallant though unsuccessful effort to be free claim upon portugal have be during the|past|year prosecute with renew vigor and have be object to employ every effort of honorable diplomacy to procure adjustment late charge d'affaires at lisbon the hon george|w.|hopkin make able and energetic but unsuccessful effort to settle these unpleasant matter of controversy and to obtain indemnity for the wrong which be the subject of complaint present charge d'affaire at that court will also bring to the prosecution of these claim ability and zeal the revolutionary and distracted condition of portugal in past time have be represent as of the lead cause of delay in indemnify suffering citizen but must now say be matter of profound regret that these claim have not yet be settle the omission of portugal to do justice to the american claimant have now assume a character so grave and serious that shall shortly make the subject of a special message to congress with a view to such ultimate action as wisdom and patriotism may suggest with russia austria prussia sweden denmark belgium the netherlands and the|italian|stat still maintain accustomed amicable relation during the recent revolution in the|papal|state charge d'affaire at rome have be unable to present letter of credence which indeed be direct by predecessor to withhold until should receive further order such be the unsettled condition of thing in those states that be not deem expedient to give any instruction on the subject of present credential letter different from those with which have be furnish by the late administration until the|25th|of|june last when in consequence of the want of accurate information of the exact state of thing at that distance from be instruct to exercise own discretion in present to the then exist government if in judgment sufficiently stable or if not to await further event since that period rome have undergo another revolution and abide the establishment of a government sufficiently permanent to justify in open diplomatic intercourse with with the|republic|of|mexico be true policy to cultivate the most friendly relation since the ratification of the treaty of guadalupe|hidalgo nothing have occur of a serious character to disturb a faithful observance of the treaty and a sincere respect for right can not fail to secure the lasting confidence and friendship of that republic the message of predecessor to the|house|of|representatives of the|8th|of|february last communicating in compliance with a resolution of that body a copy of a paper call a protocol sign at queretaro on the|30th|of|may,|1848 by the commissioner of the|united|state and the minister of foreign affair of the|mexican|government have be a subject of correspondence between the|department|of|state and the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of that republic accredit to this government a transcript of that correspondence be herewith submit the commissioner on the part of the|united|state for mark the boundary between the republics though delay in reach by unforeseen obstacle arrive at that place within a short period after the time require by the treaty and be there join by the commissioner on the part of mexico enter upon duty and at the date of the late intelligence from that|quarter some progress have be make in the survey the expense incident to the organization of the commission and to conveyance to the point where operation be to begin have so much reduce the fund appropriate by congress that a further sum to cover the charge which must be incur during the|present|fiscal|year will be necessary the great length of frontier along which the boundary extend the nature of the adjacent territory and the difficulty of obtain supply except at or near the extreme of the line render also indispensable that a liberal provision should be make to meet the necessary charge during the|fiscal|year|ending|on|the|30th|of|june,|1851 accordingly recommend this subject to attention in the adjustment of the claim of american citizen on mexico provide for by the late treaty the employment of counsel on the part of the government may become important for the purpose of assist the commissioner in protect the interest of the|united|state recommend this subject to the early and favorable consideration of congress complaint have be make in regard to the inefficiency of the mean provide by the|government|of|new|granada for transport the|united|state mail across the|isthmus|of|panama pursuant to postal convention with that republic of the|6th|of|march,|1844 charge d'affaires at bogota have be direct to make such representation to the government|of|new|granada as will be hope lead to a prompt removal of this cause of complaint the sanguinary civil war with which the|republic|of|venezuela have for some time past be ravage have be bring to a close in progress the right of some of citizen resident or trading there have be violate the restoration of order will afford the|venezuelan|government an opportunity to examine and redress these grievance and other of long stand which representative at caracas have hitherto ineffectually urge upon the attention of that government the extension of the coast of the|united|state on the pacific and the unexampled rapidity with which the inhabitant of california especially be increase in number have impart new consequence to relation with the other country whose territory border upon that ocean be probable that the intercourse between those country and possession in that|quarter particularly with the|republic|of|chili will become extensive and mutually advantageous in proportion as california and oregon shall increase in population and wealth be desirable therefore that this government should do everything in power to foster and strengthen relation with those states and that the spirit of amity between should be mutual and cordial recommend the observance of the same course toward all other american states the|united|state stand as the great american power to which as natural ally and friend will always be dispose first to look for mediation and assistance in the event of any collision between and any european nation as such may often kindly mediate in behalf without entangle in foreign war or unnecessary controversy whenever the faith of treaty with any of shall require interference must necessarily interpose a convention have be negotiate with brazil provide for the satisfaction of american claim on that government and will be submit to the senate since the last session of congress have receive an envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary from that empire and relation with be round upon the most amicable understanding attention be earnestly invite to an amendment of exist law relate to the african slave trade with a view to the effectual suppression of that barbarous traffic be not to be deny that this trade be still in part carry on by mean of vessel build in the|united|state and own or navigate by some of citizen the correspondence between the|department|of|state and the minister and consul of the|united|state at rio|de|janeiro which have from time to time be lay before congress represent that be a customary device to evade the penalty of law by mean of sea letter vessel sell in brazil when provide with such paper by the consul instead of return to the|united|states for a new register proceed at once to the coast of africa for the purpose of obtain cargo of slave much additional information of the same character have recently be transmit to the|department|of|state have not be consider the policy of law to subject an american citizen who in a foreign country purchase a vessel build in the|united|state to the inconvenience of send home for a new register before permit to proceed on a voyage any alteration of the law which may have a tendency to impede the free transfer of property in vessel between citizen or the free navigation of those vessel between different part of the world when employ in lawful commerce should be well and cautiously consider but trust that wisdom will devise a method by which general policy in this respect may be preserve and at the same time the abuse of flag by mean of sea letter in the manner indicate may be prevent have ascertain that there be no prospect of the reunion of the state of central|america which formerly compose the republic of that name have separately negotiate with some of treaty of amity and commerce which will be lay before the senate a contract have be conclude with the state of nicaragua by a company compose of american citizen for the purpose of construct a ship canal through the territory of that state to connect the atlantic and pacific ocean have direct the negotiation of a treaty with nicaragua pledge both government to protect those who shall engage in and perfect the work all other nation be invite by the|state|of|nicaragua to enter into the same treaty stipulation with and the benefit to be derive by each from such an arrangement will be the protection of this great interoceanic communication against any power which may seek to obstruct or to monopolize advantage all state enter into such a treaty will enjoy the right of passage through the canal on payment of the same toll the work if construct under these guaranty will become a bond of peace instead of a subject of contention and strife between the nation of the earth should the great maritime states|of|europe consent to this arrangement and have no reason to suppose that a proposition so fair and honorable will be oppose by any the energy of people and our will cooperate in promote the success of the enterprise do not recommend any appropriation from the|national|treasury for this purpose nor do believe that such an appropriation be necessary private enterprise if properly protect will complete the work should prove to be feasible the party who have procure the charter from nicaragua for construction desire no assistance from this government beyond protection and profess that have examine the propose line of communication will be ready to commence the undertaking whenever that protection shall be extend to should there appear to be reason on examine the whole evidence to entertain a serious doubt of the practicability of construct such a canal that doubt could be speedily solve by an actual exploration of the route should such a work be construct under the common protection of all nation for equal benefit to all would be neither just nor expedient that any great maritime state should command the communication the territory through which the canal may be open ought to be free from the claim of any foreign power no such power should occupy a position that would enable hereafter to exercise so control an influence over the commerce of the world or to obstruct a highway which ought to be dedicate to the common us of mankind the route across the|isthmus|at|tehuantepec and panama be also worthy of serious consideration do not fail to engage the attention of predecessor the negotiator of the treaty of guadalupe|hidalgo be instruct to offer a very large sum of money for the right of transit across the|isthmus|of|tehuantepec the|mexican|government do not accede to the proposition for the purchase of the right of way probably because have already contract with private individual for the construction of a passage from the|guasacualco|river to tehuantepec shall not renew any proposition to purchase for money a right which ought to be equally secure to all nation on payment of a reasonable toll to the owner of the improvement who would doubtless be well contented with that compensation and the guaranty of the maritime state of the world in separate treaty negotiate with mexico bind and to protect those who should construct the work such guaranty would do more to secure the completion of the communication through the territory of mexico than any other reasonable consideration that could be offer and as mexico would be the great gainer by the opening of this communication between the gulf and be presume that would not hesitate to yield aid in the manner propose to accomplish an improvement so important to own good interest have reason to hope that the propose railroad across the isthmus at panama will be successfully construct under the protection of the late treaty with new|granada ratified and exchange by predecessor on the|10th|day|of|june,|1848 which guarantee the perfect neutrality of the isthmus and the right of sovereignty and property of new|granada over that territory with a view that the free transit from ocean to ocean may not be interrupt or embarrassed during the existence of the treaty be policy to encourage every practicable route across the isthmus which connect north|and|south|america either by railroad or canal which the energy and enterprise of citizen may induce to complete and consider obligatory upon to adopt that policy especially in consequence of the absolute necessity of facilitate intercourse with possession on the pacific the position of the|sandwich|island with reference to the territory of the|united|state on the pacific the success of persevering and benevolent citizen who have repair to that remote quarter in christianize the native and induce to adopt a system of government and law suit to capacity and want and the use make by numerous whale ship of the harbor of the island as place of resort for obtain refreshment and repair all combine to render destiny peculiarly interesting to be duty to encourage the authority of those island in effort to improve and elevate the moral and political condition of the inhabitant and should make reasonable allowance for the difficulty inseparable from this task desire that the island may maintain independence and that other nation should concur with in this sentiment could in no event be indifferent to passing under the dominion of any other power the principal commercial state have in this a common interest and be to be hope that no one of will attempt to interpose obstacle to the entire independence of the island the receipt into the treasury for the|fiscal|year|ending|on|the|30th|of|june|last be in cash and in treasury note fund make an aggregate of and the expenditure for the same time be in cash and in treasury note fund make an aggregate of the account and estimate which will be submit to congress in the report of the secretary of the treasury show that there will probably be a deficit occasion by the expense of the|mexican|war and treaty on the|1st|day|of|july next of and on the|1st|day|of|july,|1851 of make in the whole a probable deficit to be provide for of the extraordinary expense of the war with mexico and the purchase of california and new|mexico exceed in amount this deficit together with the loan heretofore make for those object therefore recommend that authority be give to borrow what ever sum may be necessary to cover that deficit recommend the observance of strict economy in the appropriation and expenditure of public money recommend a revision of the exist tariff and adjustment on a basis which may augment the revenue do not doubt the right or duty of congress to encourage domestic industry which be the great source of national as well as individual wealth and prosperity look to the wisdom and patriotism of congress for the adoption of a system which may place home labor at last on a sure and permanent footing and by due encouragement of manufacture give a new and increase stimulus to agriculture and promote the development of vast resource and the extension of commerce believe that to the attainment of these end as well as the necessary augmentation of the revenue and the prevention of fraud a system of specific duty be best adapt strongly recommend to congress the adoption of that system fix the duty at rate high enough to afford substantial and sufficient encouragement to own industry and at the same time so adjust as to insure stability the question of the continuance of the subtreasury system be respectfully submit to the wisdom of congress if continue important modification of appear to be indispensable for further detail and view on the above and other matter connect with commerce the finance and revenue refer to the report of the secretary of the treasury no direct aid have be give by the|general|government to the improvement of agriculture except by the expenditure of small sum for the collection and publication of agricultural statistic and for some chemical analysis which have be thus far pay for out of the patent fund this aid be in opinion wholly inadequate to give to this lead branch of american industry the encouragement which merit respectfully recommend the establishment of an agricultural bureau to be connect with the|department|of|the|interior to elevate the social condition of the agriculturist to increase prosperity and to extend mean of usefulness to country by multiply source of information should be the study of every statesman and a primary object with every legislator no civil government have be provide by congress for california the people of that territory impel by the necessity of political condition recently meet in convention for the purpose of form a constitution and state government which the late advice give reason to suppose have be accomplish and be believe will shortly apply for the admission of california into the union as a sovereign state should such be the case and should constitution be conformable to the requisition of the|united|state recommend application to the favorable consideration of congress the people of new|mexico will also be believe at no very distant period present for admission into the union preparatory to the admission of california and new|mexico the people of each will have institute for a republican form of government lay foundation in such principle and organize power in such form as to shall seem most likely to effect safety and happiness by await action all cause of uneasiness may be avoid and confidence and kind feeling preserved with a view of maintain the harmony and tranquillity so dear to all should abstain from the introduction of those exciting topic of a sectional character which have hitherto produce painful apprehension in the public mind and repeat the solemn warning of the first and most illustrious of predecessor against furnish any ground for characterize party by geographical discrimination a collector have be appoint at san|francisco under the act of congress extend the revenue law over california and measure have be take to organize the custom house at that and the other port mention in that act at the early period practicable the collector proceed overland and advice have not yet be receive of arrival at san|francisco meanwhile be understand that the custom have continue to be collect there by officer act under the military authority as be during the administration of predecessor will think be expedient to confirm the collection thus make and direct the avail after such allowance as congress may think fit to authorize to be expend within the territory or to be pay into the treasury for the purpose of meeting appropriation for the improvement of river and harbor a party engage on the coast survey be dispatch to oregon in january last accord to the late advice have not leave california and direction have be give to as soon as shall have fix on the site of the light house and the buoy authorize to be construct and place in oregon to proceed without delay to make reconnaissance of the most important point on the coast of california and especially to examine and determine on site for light house on that coast the speedy erection of which be urgently demand by rapidly increase commerce have transfer the indian agency from upper missouri and council|bluff to santa|fe and salt|lake and have cause to be appoint subagent in the valley of the gila the sacramento and the san|joaquin river still further legal provision will be necessary for the effective and successful extension of system of indian intercourse over the new territory recommend the establishment of a branch mint in california as will in opinion afford important facility to those engage in mining as well as to the government in the disposition of the mineral land also recommend that commission be organize by congress to examine and decide upon the validity of the present subsist land title in california and new|mexico and that provision be make for the establishment of office of surveyor general in new|mexico california and oregon and for the surveying and bring into market the public land in those territories those land remote in position and difficult of access ought to be dispose of on term liberal to all but especially favorable to the early emigrant in order that the situation and character of the principal mineral deposit in california may be ascertain recommend that a geological and mineralogical exploration be connect with the linear survey and that the mineral land be divide into small lot suitable for mining and be dispose of by sale or lease so as to give citizen an opportunity of procure a permanent right of property in the soil this would seem to be as important to the success of mining as of agricultural pursuit the great mineral wealth of california and the advantage which port and harbor and those of oregon afford to commerce especially with the island of the pacific and indian ocean and the populous region of eastern asia make certain that there will arise in a|few|year large and prosperous community on western coast therefore become important that a line of communication the good and most expeditious which the nature of the country will admit should be open within the territory of the|united|state from the navigable water of the atlantic or the|gulf|of|mexico to the pacific opinion as elicit and express by large and respectable convention lately assemble at st.|louis and memphis point to a railroad as that which if practicable will best meet the wish and want of the country but while this if in successful operation would be a work of great national importance and of a value to the country which would be difficult to estimate ought also to be regard as an undertaking of vast magnitude and expense and one which must if be indeed practicable encounter many difficulty in construction and use therefore to avoid failure and disappointment to enable congress to judge whether in the condition of the country through which must pass the work be feasible and if be find so whether should be undertake as a national improvement or leave to individual enterprise and in the latter alternative what aid if any ought to be extend to by the government recommend as a preliminary measure a careful reconnaissance of the several propose route by a scientific corps and a report as to the practicability of make such a road with an estimate of the cost of construction and support for further view on these and other matter connect with the duty of the home department refer to the report of the secretary of the interior recommend early appropriation for continue the river and harbor improvement which have be already begin and also for the construction of those for which estimate have be make as well as for examination and estimate preparatory to the commencement of such other as the want of the country and especially the advance of population over new district and the extension of commerce may render necessary an estimate of the amount which can be advantageously expend within the|next|fiscal|year under the direction of the|bureau|of|topographical|engineers accompany the report of the secretary of war to which respectfully invite the attention of congress the cession of territory make by the late treaty with mexico have greatly extend expose frontier and render defense more difficult that treaty have also bring under obligation to mexico to comply with which a military force be requisite but military establishment be not materially change as to efficiency from the condition in which stand before the commencement of the|mexican|war some addition to will therefore be necessary and recommend to the favorable consideration of congress an increase of the several corps of the army at distant western post as propose in the accompanying report of the secretary of war great embarrassment have result from the effect upon rank in the army heretofore give to brevet and staff commission the view of the secretary of war on this subject be deem important and if carry into effect will be believe promote the harmony of the service the plan propose for retire disabled officer and provide an asylum for such of the rank and file as from age wound and other infirmity occasion by service have become unfit to perform respective duty be recommend as a means of increase the efficiency of the army and as an act of justice due from a grateful country to the faithful soldier the accompanying report of the secretary of the navy present a full and satisfactory account of the condition and operation of the naval service during the|past|year citizen engage in the legitimate pursuit of commerce have enjoy benefit wherever national vessel have go have be receive with respect officer have be treat with kindness and courtesy and have on all occasion pursue a course of strict neutrality in accordance with the policy of government the naval force at present in commission be as large as be admissible with the number of man authorize by congress to be employ invite attention to the recommendation of the secretary of the navy on the subject of a reorganization of the navy in various grade of officer and the establishing of a retire list for such of the officer as be disqualify for active and effective service should congress adopt some such measure as be recommend will greatly increase the efficiency of the navy and reduce expenditure also ask attention to the view express by in reference to the employment of war steamer and in regard to the contract for the transportation of the|united|state mail and the operation of the system upon the prosperity of the navy by an act of congress pass august|14,|1848 provision be make for extend post - office and mail accommodation to california and oregon exertion have be make to execute that law but the limited provision of the act the inadequacy of the mean authorize the ill adaptation of post - office law to the situation of that country and the measure of compensation for service allow by those law compare with the price of labor and rent in california render those exertion in a great degree ineffectual more particular and efficient provision by law be require on this subject the act of reduce postage have now by operation during four|years produce result fully show that the income from such reduced postage be sufficient to sustain the whole expense of the service of the|post office|department not include the cost of transportation in mail steamer on the line from new|york to chagre and from panama to astoria which have not be consider by congress as properly belong to the mail service be submit to the wisdom of congress whether a further reduction of postage should not now be make more particularly on the letter correspondence this should be relieve from the unjust burden of transport and deliver the franked matter of congress for which public service provision should be make from the treasury confidently believe that a change may safely be make reduce all single letter postage to the uniform rate of regardless of distance without thereby impose any great tax on the treasury than would constitute a very moderate compensation for this public service and therefore respectfully recommend such a reduction should congress prefer to abolish the franking privilege entirely seem probable that no demand on the treasury would result from the propose reduction of postage whether any further diminution should now be make or the result of the reduction to which have recommend should be first test be submit to decision since the commencement of the last session of congress a postal treaty with great|britain have be receive and ratified and such relation have be form by the post - office department of the country in pursuance of that treaty as to carry provision into full operation the attempt to extend this same arrangement through england to france have not be equally successful but the purpose have not be abandon for a particular statement of the condition of the|post office|department and other matter connect with that branch of the public service refer to the report of the|postmaster general by the act of the of march,|1849 a board be constitute to make arrangement for take the|seventh|census compose of the secretary of state the attorney general and the|postmaster general and be make the duty of this board to prepare and cause to be print such form and schedule as may be necessary for the full enumeration of the inhabitant of the|united|state and also proper form and schedule for collect in statistical table under proper head such information as to mine agriculture commerce manufacture education and other topic as would exhibit a full view of the pursuit industry education and resource of the country the duty enjoin upon the census board thus establish have be perform now rest with congress to enact a law for carry into effect the provision of the constitution which require an actual enumeration of the people of the|united|state within the|ensuing|year among the duty assign by the constitution to the|general|government be of local and limited application but not on that account the less obligatory allude to the trust commit to congress as the exclusive legislator and sole guardian of the interest of beg to commend these interest to kind attention as the national metropolis the city of washington must be an object of general interest and found as be under the auspex of whose immortal name bear claim to the foster care of congress present with additional strength whatever can contribute to prosperity must enlist the feeling of constitutional guardian and command favorable consideration government be of limited power and successful administration eminently depend on the confinement of each of coordinate branch within own appropriate sphere the first section of the constitution ordain all legislative power herein grant shall be vest in a congress of the|united|state which shall consist of a senate and house|of|representatif the executive have authority to recommend not to dictate measure to congress have perform that duty the executive department of the government can not rightfully control the decision of congress on any subject of legislation until that decision shall have be officially submit to the president for approval the check provide by the constitution in the clause confer the qualified veto will never be exercise by except in the case contemplate by the father of the republic view as an extreme measure to be resort to only in extraordinary case as where may become necessary to defend the executive against the encroachment of the legislative power or to prevent hasty and inconsiderate or unconstitutional legislation by cautiously confine this remedy within the sphere prescribe to in the contemporaneous exposition of the framer of the constitution the will of the people legitimately express on all subject of legislation through constitutional organ the|senators|and|representatives|of the|united|state will have full effect as indispensable to the preservation

consummation of the ratification of the treaty by the president of mexico no reference be make to on the contrary this ratification which be deliver to the commissioner of the|united|state and be now in the|state|department contain a full and explicit recognition of the amendment of the senate just as have be communicate to that government by the secretary of state and be afterwards approve by the|mexican|congress declare have see and examine the say treaty and the modification make by the senate of the|united|states|of|america and have give an account thereof to the|general|congress conformably to the requirement in the fourteenth paragraph of the one|hundred|and|tenth article of the federal constitution of these|united|states that body have think proper to approve of the say treaty with the modification thereto in all part and in consequence thereof exert the power grant to by the constitution accept ratify and confirm the say treaty with modification and promise in the name of the|mexican|republic to fulfill and observe and to cause to be fulfil and observe upon an examination of this protocol when be receive with the ratified treaty do not regard as material or as in any way attempt to modify or change the treaty as have be amend by the senate of the|united|state the first explanation which contain be that the|american|government by suppress the ninth article of the treaty of guadalupe and substitute the third article of the treaty of louisiana do not intend to diminish in any way what be agree upon by the aforesaid article ninth in favor of the inhabitant of the territory cede by mexico understanding be that all of that agreement be contain in the third article of the treaty of louisiana in consequence all the privilege and guaranty civil political and religious which would have be possess by the inhabitant of the cede territory if the ninth article of the treaty have be retain will be enjoy by without any difference under the article which have be substitute the ninth article of the original treaty stipulate for the incorporation of the mexican inhabitant of the cede territory and admission into the union as soon as possible accord to the principle of the|federal|constitution to the enjoyment of all the right of citizen of the|united|state provide also that in the meantime should be maintain in the enjoyment of liberty property and civil right now vest in accord to the mexican law secure to similar political right with the inhabitant of the other territories of the|united|state and at least equal to the inhabitant of louisiana and florida when be in a territorial condition then proceed to guarantee that ecclesiastic and religious corporation should be protect in the discharge of the office of ministry and the enjoyment of property of every kind whether individual or corporate and finally that there should be a free communication between the catholics of the cede territory and ecclesiastical authority even although such authority should reside within the limit of the|mexican|republic as define by this treaty the ninth article of the treaty as adopt by the senate be much more comprehensive in term and explicit in meaning and clearly embrace in comparatively few word all the guaranty insert in the original article be as follow mexicans who in the territory aforesaid shall not preserve the character of citizen of the|mexican|republic conformably with what be stipulate in the precede article shall be incorporate into and be admit at the proper time to be judge of by the|congress|of|the|united|state to the enjoyment of all the right of citizen of the|united|state accord to the principle of the constitution and in the meantime shall be maintain and protect in the free enjoyment of liberty and property and secure in the free exercise of religion without restriction this article which be substantially copy from the louisiana treaty provide equally with the original article for the admission of these inhabitant into the union and in the meantime whilst shall remain in a territorial state by sweeping provision declare that shall be maintain and protect in the free enjoyment of liberty and property and secure in the free exercise of religion without restriction this guaranty embrace every kind of property whether hold by ecclesiastic or layman whether belong to corporation or individual secure to these inhabitant the free exercise of religion without restriction whether choose to place under the spiritual authority of pastor resident within the|mexican|republic or the cede territory be be presume to place this construction beyond all question that the senate superadde the word without restriction to the religious guaranty contain in the corresponding article of the louisiana treaty congress do not possess the power under the constitution to make any law prohibit the free exercise of religion if the ninth article of the treaty whether in original or amend form have be entirely omit in the treaty all the right and privilege which either of confer would have be secure to the inhabitant of the cede territory by the constitution and law of the|united|state the protocol assert that the|american|government by suppress the tenth article of the treaty of guadalupe do not in any way intend to annul the grant of land make by mexico in the cede territory that these grant notwithstanding the suppression of the article of the treaty preserve the legal value which may possess and the grantee may cause legitimate title to be acknowledge before the american tribunal and then proceed to state that conformably to the law of the|united|state legitimate title to every description of property personal and real exist in the cede territory be those which be legitimate title under the mexican law in california and new|mexico up|to|the|13th|of|may,|1846 and in texas up to the|2d of march,|1836 the former be the date of the declaration of war against mexico and the latter that of the declaration of independence by texas the objection to the tenth article of the original treaty be not that protect legitimate title which law would have equally protect without but that most unjustly attempt to resuscitate grant which have become a mere nullity by allow the grantee the same period after the exchange of the ratification of the treaty to which have be originally entitle after the date of grant for the purpose of perform the condition on which have be make in submit the treaty to the senate have recommend the rejection of this article that portion of in regard to land in texas do not receive a single vote in the senate this information be communicate by the letter of the secretary of state to the minister for foreign affair of mexico and be in possession of the|mexican|government during the whole period the treaty be before the|mexican|congress and the article be reprobate in that letter in the strong term besides commissioner to mexico have be instruct neither the president nor the senate of the|united|state can ever consent to ratify any treaty contain the tenth article of the treaty of guadalupe|hidalgo in favor of grantee of land in texas or elsewhere and again should the mexican|government persist in retain this article then all prospect of immediate peace be end and of this may give an absolute assurance on this point the language of the protocol be free from ambiguity but if be otherwise be there any individual american or mexican who would place such a construction upon as to convert into a vain attempt to revive this article which have be so often and so solemnly condemn surely no person could for moment suppose that either the commissioner of the|united|state or the mexican minister for foreign affair ever entertain the purpose of thus set at naught the deliberate decision of the president and senate which have be communicate to the|mexican|government with the assurance that abandonment of this obnoxious article be essential to the restoration of peace but the meaning of the protocol be plain be simply that the nullification of this article be not intend to destroy valid legitimate title to land which exist and be in full force independently of the provision and without the aid of this article notwithstanding have be expunge from the treaty these grant be to preserve the legal value which may possess the refusal to revive grant which have become extinct be not to invalidate those which be in full force and vigor that such be the clear understanding of the senate of the|united|state and this in perfect accordance with the protocol be manifest from the fact that whilst strike from the treaty this unjust article at the same time sanction and ratify the last paragraph of the eighth article of the treaty which declare in the say territory property of every kind now belong to mexicans not establish there shall be inviolably respect the present owner the heir of these and all mexicans who may hereafter acquire say property by contract shall enjoy with respect to guaranty equally ample as if the same belong to citizen of the|united|state without any stipulation in the treaty to this effect all such valid title under the|mexican|government would have be protect under the constitution and law of the|united|state the third and last explanation contain in the protocol be the government of the|united|state by suppress the concluding paragraph of article|12|of|the|treaty do not intend to deprive the|mexican|republic of the free and unrestrained faculty of ceding conveying or transfer at any time as may judge best the sum of the which the same government|of|the|united|states be to deliver in the place designate by the amend article the concluding paragraph of the original twelfth article thus suppress by the senate be in the following language certificate in proper form for the say installment respectively in such sum as shall be desire by the|mexican|government and transferable by shall be deliver to the say government by that of from this bare statement of fact the meaning of the protocol be obvious although the senate have decline to create a government stock for the and issue transferable certificate for the amount in such sum as the|mexican|government may desire yet could not have intend thereby to deprive that government of the faculty which every creditor possess of transfer for own benefit the obligation of debtor whatever this may be worth accord to will and pleasure can not be doubt that the twelfth article of the treaty as now stand contain a positive obligation in consideration of the extension acquire by the boundary of the|united|state to pay to in equal annual installment of three|million each this obligation may be assign by the|mexican|government to any person whatever but the assignee in such case would stand in no well condition than the government the amendment of the senate prohibit the issue of a government transferable stock for the amount produce this effect and no more the protocol contain nothing from which can be infer that the assignee could rightfully demand the payment of the money in case the consideration should fail which be state on the face of the obligation with this view of the whole protocol and consider that the explanation which contain be in accordance with the treaty do not deem necessary to take any action upon the subject have varied from the term of the treaty as amend by the senate although would even then have be a nullity in yet duty may have require that should make this fact know to the|mexican|government this not be the case treat in the same manner would have do have these explanation be make verbally by the commissioner to the mexican minister for foreign affair and communicate in a dispatch to transcript to the|house|of|representatives of the|united|state in answer to the resolution of the|house|of|representatives of the 18th of december request information under what law or provision of the constitution or by what other authority the secretary of the treasury with the sanction and approval of the president establish a tariff of duty in the port of the|mexican|republic during the war with mexico and by what legal constitutional or other authority the revenue thus derive be appropriate to the support of the army in mexico refer the house to annual message of the 7th of december to message to the senate of the 10th of february respond to a call of that body a copy of which be herewith communicate and to message to the|house|of|representatives of the 24th of july respond to a call of that house the resolution assume that the secretary of the treasury establish a tariff of duty in the port of the contribution collect in this mode be not establish by the secretary of the treasury but by a military order issue by the president through the|war|and navy departments for information the president direct the secretary of the treasury to prepare and report to a scale of duty that report be make and the president 's military order of the|31st|of|march,|1847 be base upon the document communicate to congress with annual message of december,|1847 show the true character of that order the authority under which military contribution be exact and collect from the enemy and apply to the support of army during the war with mexico be state in the several message refer to in the first of these message inform congress on the|31st|of|march last cause an order to be issue to military and naval commander to levy and collect a military contribution upon all vessel and merchandise which may enter any of the port of mexico in military occupation and to apply such contribution toward defray the expense of the war by virtue of the right of conquest and the law of war the conqueror consult own safety or convenience may either exclude foreign commerce altogether from all such port or permit upon such term and condition as may prescribe before the principal port of mexico be blockade by navy the revenue derive from import duty under the law of mexico be pay into the mexican treasury after these port have fall into military possession the blockade be raise and commerce with permit upon prescribe term and condition be open to the trade of all nation upon the payment of duty more moderate in amount than those which have be previously levy by mexico and the revenue which be formerly pay into the mexican treasury be direct to be collect by military and naval officer and apply to the use of army and navy care be take that the officer soldier and sailor of army and navy should be exempt from the operation of the order and as the merchandise import upon which the order operate must be consume by mexican citizen the contribution exact be in effect the seizure of the public revenue of mexico and the application of to own use in direct this measure the object be to compel the enemy to contribute as far as practicable toward the expense of the war be also state in that message that-- measure have recently be adopt by which the internal as well as the external revenue of mexico in all place in military occupation will be seize and appropriate to the use of army and navy the policy of levy upon the enemy contribution in every form consistently with the law of nation which may be practicable for military commander to adopt should in judgment be rigidly enforce and order to this effect have accordingly be give by such a policy at the same time that own treasury will be relieve from a heavy drain the mexican people will be make to feel the burden of the war and consult own interest may be induce the more readily to require ruler to accede to a just peace in the same message inform congress that the amount of the loan which would be require for the further prosecution of the war may be reduce by whatever amount of expenditure can be save by military contribution collect in mexico and that the most rigorous measure for the augmentation of these contribution have be direct and a very considerable sum be expect from that source the secretary of the treasury in annual report of that|year in make estimate of the amount of loan which would probably be require reduce the sum in consideration of the amount which would probably be derive from these contribution and congress authorize the loan upon this reduce estimate in the message of the|10th|of|february,|1848 to the senate be state no principle be better establish than that a nation at war have the right of shift the burden off and impose on the enemy by exact military contribution the mode of make such exaction must be leave to the discretion of the conqueror but should be exercise in a manner conformable to the rule of civilized warfare the right to levy these contribution be essential to the successful prosecution of war in an enemy 's country and the practice of nation have be in accordance with this principle be as clearly necessary as the right to fight battle and exercise be often essential to the subsistence of the army entertain no doubt that the military right to exclude commerce altogether from the port of the enemy in military occupation include the minor right of admit under prescribed condition become an important question at the date of the order whether there should be a discrimination between vessel and cargo belong to citizen of the|united|state and vessel and cargo belong to neutral nation in the message to the|house|of|representatives of the 24th of july be state be from the same source of authority that derive the unquestioned right after the war have be declare by congress to blockade the port and coast of the enemy to capture town city and province and to levy contribution upon for the support of army of the same character with these be the right to subject to temporary military government the conquer territory of enemy be all belligerent right and exercise be as essential to the successful prosecution of a foreign war as the right to fight battle by the constitution the power to declare war be vest in congress and by the same instrument be provide that the president shall be commander in chief of the army and navy of the|united|state and that shall take care that the law be faithfully execute when congress have exert power by declare war against a foreign nation be the duty of the president to prosecute the constitution have prescribe no particular mode in which shall perform this duty the manner of conduct the war be not define by the constitution the term war use in that instrument have a well understand meaning among nation that meaning be derive from the law of nation a code which be recognize by all civilized power as be obligatory in a state of war the power be derive from the constitution and the manner of exercise be regulate by the law of nation when congress have declare war in effect make the duty of the president in prosecute by land and sea to resort to all the mode and to exercise all the power and right which other nation at war possess be invest with the same power in this respect as if be personally present command fleet by sea or army by land may conduct the war by issue order for fight battle besiege and capture city conquer and hold the province of the enemy or by capture vessel and other property on the high sea but these be not the only mode of prosecute war which be recognize by the law of nation and to which be authorize to resort the levy of contribution on the enemy be a right of war well establish and universally acknowledge among nation and one which every belligerent possess the ability may properly exercise the most approve writer on public law admit and vindicate this right as consonant with reason justice and humanity no principle be better establish than have a fight to deprive enemy of possession of everything which may augment strength and enable to make war this everyone endeavor to accomplish in the manner most suitable to whenever have an opportunity seize on the enemy 's property and convert to own use and thus besides diminish the enemy 's power augment own and obtain at least a partial indemnification or equivalent either for what constitute the subject of the war or for the expense and loss incur in prosecution in a word do justice instead of the custom of pillage the open country and defenseless place the levy of contribution have be substitute whoever carry on a just war have a fight to make the enemy 's country contribute to the support of army and toward defray all the charge of the war thus obtain a part of what be due to and the enemy 's subject by consent to pay the sum demand have property secure from pillage and the country be preserve these principle be believe be uncontroverted by any civilized nation in modern time the public law of nation by which be recognize have be hold by high judicial tribunal as a code which be applicable to situation in a state of war and bind on the|united|state while in admiralty and maritime case be often the governing rule be in a just war that a nation have the right to make the enemy 's country contribute to the support of army not doubt that late war with mexico be just on the part of the|united|state do not hesitate when charge by the constitution with prosecution to exercise a power common to all other nation and congress be duly inform of the mode and extent to which that power have be and would be exercise at the commencement of first session thereafter upon the declaration of war against mexico by congress the|united|state be entitle to all the right which any other nation at war would have possess these right could only be demand and enforce by the president whose duty be as commander in chief of the army and navy of the|united|state to execute the law of congress which declare the war in the act declare war congress provide for raise man and money to enable the president to prosecute to a speedy and successful termination congress prescribe no mode of conduct but leave the president to prosecute accord to the law of nation as guide indeed would have be impracticable for congress to have provide for all the detail of a campaign the mode of levy contribution must necessarily be leave to the discretion of the conqueror subject to be exercise however in conformity with the law of nation may be exercise by require a give sum or a give amount of provision to be furnish by the authority of a capture city or province may be exercise by impose an internal tax or a tax on the enemy 's commerce whereby may be deprive of revenue and these may be appropriate to the use of the conqueror the latter mode be adopt by the collection of duty in the port of mexico in military occupation during the late war with that republic so well establish be the military right to do this under the law of nation that military and naval officer command force on the theater of war adopt the same mode of levy contribution from the enemy before the order of the president of the|31st|of|march,|1847 be issue the general in command of the army at vera|cruz upon own view of power and duty and without specific instruction to that effect immediately after the capture of that city adopt this mode by order of the|28th|of|march,|1847 heretofore communicate to the|house|of|representatives direct a temporary and moderate tariff of duty to be establish such a tariff be establish and contribution be collect under and apply to the us of army at a still early period the same power be exercise by the naval officer in command of squadron on the pacific coast not doubt the authority to resort to this mode the order of the|31st|of|march,|1847 be issue and be in effect but a modification of the previous order of these officer by make the rate of contribution uniform and direct collection in all the port of the enemy in military occupation and under temporary military government the right to levy contribution upon the enemy in the form of import and export duty in port be sanction by the treaty of peace with mexico by that treaty both government recognize and confirm the exercise of that right by provision the custom house at all the port occupy by the force of the|united|state be upon the exchange of ratification to be deliver up to the mexican authority together with all bond and evidence of debt for duty on importation and exportation not yet fall due and all duty on import and on export collect at such custom house or elsewhere in mexico by authority of the|united|state before the ratification of the treaty by the|mexican|government be to be retain by the|united|state and only the net amount of the duty collect after this period be to be deliver to the|mexican|government by provision also all merchandise import previously to the restoration of the custom house to the mexican authority or export from any mexican port whilst in the occupation of the force of the|united|state be protect from confiscation and from the payment of any import or export duty to the|mexican|government even although the importation of such merchandise be prohibit by the mexican tariff the treaty also provide that should the custom house be surrender to the mexican authority in less|than|sixty|day from the date of signature the rate of duty on merchandise impose by the|united|state be in that event to survive the war until the end of this period and in the meantime mexican custom house officer be bind to levy no other duty thereon than the duty establish by the tariff find in force at such custom house at the time of the restoration of the same the tariff find in force at such custom house which be recognize and sustain by this stipulation be that establish by the military order of the|31st|of|march,|1847 as a mode of levy and collect military contribution from the enemy the fight to blockade the port and coast of the enemy in war be no more provide for or prescribe by the constitution than the right to levy and collect contribution from in the form of duty or otherwise and yet have not be question that the president have the power after war have be declare by congress to order navy to blockade the port and coast of mexico the right in both case exist under the law of nation if the president can not order military contribution to be collect without an act of congress for the same reason can not order a blockade nor can direct the enemy 's vessel to be capture on the high sea nor can order military and naval officer to invade the enemy 's country conquer hold and subject to military government city and province nor can give to military and naval commander order to perform many other act essential to success in war if when the|city|of|mexico be capture the commander of force have find in the mexican treasury public money which the enemy have provide to support army can be doubt that possess the right to seize and appropriate for the use of own army if the money capture from the enemy could have be thus lawfully seize and appropriate would have be by virtue of the law of war recognize by all civilized nation and by the same authority the source of revenue and of supply of the enemy may be cut off from whereby may be weaken and cripple in mean of continue or wag the war if the commander of force white act under the order of the president in the heart of the enemy 's country and surround by a hostile population possess none of these essential and indispensable power of war but must halt the army at every step of progress and wait for an act of congress to be pass to authorize to do that which every other nation have the right to do by virtue of the law of nation then indeed be the government of the|united|state in a condition of imbecility and weakness which must in all future time render impossible to prosecute a foreign war in an enemy 's country successfully or to vindicate the national right and the national honor by war the contribution levy be collect in the enemy 's country and be order to be apply in the enemy 's country toward defray the expense of the war and the appropriation make by congress for that purpose be thus relieve and considerable balance remain undrawn from the treasury the amount of contribution remain unexpended at the close of the war as far as the account of collect and disburse officer have be settle have be pay into the treasury in pursuance of an order for that purpose except the sum apply toward the payment of the first installment due under the treaty with mexico as state in last annual message for which an appropriation have be make by congress the account of some of these officer as state in the report of the secretary of war accompany that message will require legislation before can be finally settle in the late war with mexico be confidently believe that the levy of contribution and the seizure of the source of public revenue upon which the enemy rely to enable to continue the war essentially contribute to hasten peace by those mean the government and people of mexico be make to feel the pressure of the war and to realize that if be protract burden and inconvenience must be bear by notwithstanding the great success of arm may well be doubt whether an honorable peace would yet have be obtain but for the very contribution which be exact transcript fellow citizens of the senate and of the|house|of|representatives under the benignant providence of almighty god the representative of the states and of the people be again bring together to deliberate for the public good the gratitude of the nation to

successful in review the great event of the|past|year and contrast the agitated and disturbed state of other country with own tranquil and happy condition may congratulate that be the most favored

history of human event whilst will consolidate and strengthen the power of germany must essentially promote the cause of peace commerce civilization and constitutional liberty throughout the world with all the government on this continent relation be believe be now on a more friendly and satisfactory footing than have ever be at any former period since the exchange of ratification of the treaty of peace with mexico intercourse with the government of that republic have be of the most friendly character the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the|united|state to mexico have be receive and accredit and a diplomatic representative from mexico of similar rank have be receive and accredit by this government the amicable relation between the country which have be suspend have be happily restore and be destine trust to be long preserve the republics both situate on this continent and with coterminous territory have every motive of sympathy and of interest to bind together in perpetual amity this gratify condition of foreign relation render unnecessary for to call attention more specifically to have be constant aim and desire to cultivate peace and commerce with all nation tranquility at home and peaceful relation abroad constitute the true permanent policy of country war the scourge of nation sometimes become inevitable but be always to be avoid when can be do consistently with the right and honor of a nation of the most important result of the war into which be recently force with a neighboring nation be the demonstration have afford of the military strength of country before the late war with mexico|european and other foreign power entertain imperfect and erroneous view of physical strength as a nation and of ability to prosecute war and especially a war wag out of out own country see that stand army on the peace establishment do not exceed man accustom to maintain in peace large stand army for the protection of throne against own subject as well as against foreign enemy have not conceive that be possible for a nation without such an army well disciplined and of long service to wage war successfully hold in low repute militia and be far from regard as an effective force unless may be for temporary defensive operation when invade on own soil the event of the late war with mexico have not only undeceived but have remove erroneous impression which prevail to some extent even among a portion of own countryman that war have demonstrate that upon the breaking out of hostility not anticipate and for which no previous preparation have be make a volunteer army of citizen soldier equal to veteran troop and in number equal to any emergency can in a short period be bring into the field unlike what would have occur in any other country be under no necessity of resort to draft or conscription on the contrary such be the number of volunteer who patriotically tender service that the chief difficulty be in make selection and determine who should be disappoint and compel to remain at home citizen soldier be unlike those draw from the population of any other country be compose indiscriminately of all profession and pursuit of farmer lawyer physician merchant manufacturer mechanic and laborer and this not only among the officer but the private soldier in the rank citizen soldier be unlike those of any other country in other respect be armed and have be accustom from youth up to handle and use firearm and a large proportion of especially in the western and more newly settle states be expert marksman be man who have a reputation to maintain at home by good conduct in the field be intelligent and there be an individuality of character which be find in the rank of no other army in battle each private man as well as every officer right not only for country but for glory and distinction among fellow citizen when shall return to civil life the war with mexico have demonstrate not only the ability of the government to organize a numerous army upon a sudden call but also to provide with all the munition and necessary supply with dispatch convenience and ease and to direct operation with efficiency the strength of institution have not only be display in the valor and skill of troop engage in active service in the field but in the organization of those executive branch which be charge with the general direction and conduct of the war while too great praise can not be bestow upon the officer and man who fight battle would be unjust to withhold from those officer necessarily station at home who be charge with the duty of furnish the army in proper time and at proper place with all the munition of war and other supply so necessary to make efficient the commendation to which be entitle the credit due to this class of officer be the great when be consider that no army in ancient or modern time be even better appoint or provide than army in mexico operate in an enemy 's country remove from the seat of the|federal|government different corps spread over a vast extent of territory hundred and even thousands|of|mil apart from each other nothing short of the untiring vigilance and extraordinary energy of these officer could have enable to provide the army at all point and in proper season with all that be require for the most efficient service be but an act of justice to declare that the officer in charge of the several executive bureaus all under the immediate eye and supervision of the secretary of war perform respective duty with ability energy and efficiency have reap less of the glory of the war not have be personally expose to peril in battle than companion in arm but without forecast efficient aid and cooperation those in the field would not have be provide with the ample mean possess of achieve for and country the unfading honor which have win for both when all these fact be consider may cease to be a matter of so much amazement abroad how happen that noble army in mexico regular and volunteer be victorious upon every battlefield however fearful the odd against the war with mexico have thus fully develop the capacity of republican government to prosecute successfully a just and necessary foreign war with all the vigor usually attribute to more arbitrary form of government have be usual for writer on public law to impute to republic a want of that unity concentration of purpose and vigor of execution which be generally admit to belong to the monarchical and aristocratic form and this feature of popular government have be suppose to display more particularly in the conduct of a war carry on in an enemy 's territory the war with great|britain in be to a great extent confine within own limit and shed but little light on this subject but the war which have just close by an honorable peace evince beyond all doubt that a popular representative government be equal to any emergency which be likely to arise in the affair of a nation the war with mexico have develop most strikingly and conspicuously another feature in institution be that without cost to the government or danger to liberty have in the bosom of society of freeman available in a just and necessary war virtually a stand army of armed citizen soldier such as fight the battle of mexico but military strength do not consist alone in capacity for extended and successful operation on land the navy be an important arm of the national defense if the service of the navy be not so brilliant as those of the army in the late war with mexico be because have no enemy to meet on own element while the army have opportunity of perform more conspicuous service the navy largely participate in the conduct of the war both branch of the service perform whole duty to the country for the able and gallant service of the officer and man of the navy act independently as well as in cooperation with troop in the conquest of the californias the capture of vera|cruz and the seizure and occupation of other important position on the gulf and pacific coast the high praise be due vigilance energy and skill render the most effective service in exclude munition of war and other supply from the enemy while secure a safe entrance for abundant supply for own army extended commerce be nowhere interrupt and for this immunity from the evil of war the country be indebte to the navy high praise be due to the officer of the several executive bureaus navy yard and station connect with the service all under the immediate direction of the secretary of the navy for the industry foresight and energy with which everything be direct and furnish to give efficiency to that branch of the service the same vigilance exist in direct the operation of the navy as of the army there be concert of action and of purpose between the head of the arm of the service by the order which be from time to time issue vessel of war on the pacific and the|gulf|of|mexico be station in proper time and in proper position to cooperate efficiently with the army by this mean combine power be bring to bear successfully on the enemy the great result which have be develop and bring to light by this war will be of immeasurable importance in the future progress of country will tend powerfully to preserve from foreign collision and to enable to pursue uninterruptedly cherished policy of peace with all nation entangle alliance with none occupy as do a more commanding position among nation than at any former period duty and responsibility to and to posterity be correspondingly increase this will be the more obvious when consider the vast addition which have be recently make to territorial possession and great importance and value within less|than|four|year the annexation of texas to the union have be consummate all conflicting title to the|oregon|territory south of the ninth degree of north latitude be all that be insist on by any of predecessor have be adjust and new|mexico and upper|california have be acquire by treaty the area of these several territories accord to a report carefully prepare by the commissioner of the|general|land|office from the most authentic information in possession and which be herewith transmit contain or 763,559,040|acres while the area of the remain state and the territory not yet organize into states east of the rocky|mountain contain or 1,318,126,058|acre these estimate show that the territory recently acquire and over which exclusive jurisdiction and dominion have be extend constitute a country more|than|half as large as all that which be hold by the|united|state before acquisition if oregon be exclude from the estimate there will still remain within the limit of texas new|mexico and california 851,598|square|mile or be an addition equal to third of all the territory own by the|united|state before acquisition and include oregon nearly as great an extent of territory as the whole of europe russia only except the mississippi so lately the frontier of country be now only center with the addition of the late acquisition the|united|state be now estimate to be nearly as large as the whole of europe be estimate by the superintendent of the|coast|survey in the accompanying report that the extent of the seacoast of texas on the|gulf|of|mexico be upward of of the coast of upper|california on the pacific of and of oregon include the straits of fuca of make the whole extent of seacoast on the pacific and the whole extent on both the pacific and the|gulf|of|mexico the length of the coast on the atlantic from the northern limit of the|united|state around the cape of florida to the sabine on the eastern boundary of texas be estimate to be so that the addition of seacoast include oregon be very nearly|two third as great as all possess before and exclude oregon be an addition of be nearly equal to half of the extent of coast which possess before these acquisition have now great maritime front on the atlantic the|gulf|of|mexico and the pacific make in the whole an extent of seacoast exceed this be the extent of the seacoast of the|united|state not include bay sound and small irregularity of the main shore and of the sea island if these be include the length of the shore line of coast as estimate by the superintendent of the|coast|survey in report would be would be difficult to calculate the value of these immense addition to territorial possession texas lie contiguous to the western boundary of louisiana embrace within limit a part of the navigable tributary water of the mississippi and an extensive seacoast could not long have remain in the hand of a foreign power without endanger the peace of southwestern frontier product in the vicinity of the tributary of the mississippi must have seek a market through these stream run into and through territory and the danger of irritation and collision of interest between texas as a foreign state and would have be imminent while the embarrassment in the commercial intercourse between must have be constant and unavoidable have texas fall into the hand or under the influence and control of a strong maritime or military foreign power as may have do these danger would have be still great have be avoid by voluntary and peaceful annexation to the|united|state texas from position be a natural and almost indispensable part of territory fortunately have be restore to country and now constitute of the states of confederacy upon an equal footing with the original states the salubrity of climate the fertility of soil peculiarly adapt to the production of some of most valuable staple commodity and commercial advantage must soon make of most populous states new|mexico though situate in the interior and without a seacoast be know to contain much fertile land to abound in rich mine of the precious metal and to be capable of sustain a large population from position be the intermediate and connect territory between settlement and possession in texas and those on upper california irrespective of the vast mineral wealth recently develop there hold at this|day in point of value and importance to the rest of the union the same relation that louisiana do when that fine territory be acquire from france extend nearly ten|degree of latitude along the pacific and embrace the only safe and commodious harbor on that coast for many|hundred|miles with a temperate climate and an extensive interior of fertile land be scarcely possible to estimate wealth until shall be bring under the government of law and resource fully develop from position must command the rich commerce of china of asia of the island of the pacific of western mexico of central|america the|south|american|state and of the russian possession border on that ocean a great emporium will doubtless speedily arise on the californian coast which may be destine to rival in importance new|orleans the depot of the vast commerce which must exist on the pacific will probably be at some point on the|bay|of|san|francisco and will occupy the same relation to the whole western coast of that ocean as new|orleans do to the valley of the mississippi and the|gulf|of|mexico to this depot numerous whale ship will resort with cargo to trade refit and obtain supply this of will largely contribute to build up a city which would soon become the center of a great and rapidly increase commerce situate on a safe harbor sufficiently capacious for all the navy as well as the marine of the world and convenient to excellent timber for shipbuilding own by the|united|state must become great western naval depot be know that mine of the precious metal exist to a considerable extent in california at the time of acquisition recent discovery render probable that these mine be more extensive and valuable than be anticipate the account of the abundance of gold in that territory be of such an extraordinary character as would scarcely command belief be not corroborate by the authentic report of officer in the public service who have visit the mineral district and derive the fact which detail from personal observation reluctant to credit the report in general circulation as to the quantity of gold the officer command force in california visit the mineral district in july last for the purpose of obtain accurate information on the subject report to of the result of examination and the fact obtain on the spot be herewith lay before congress when visit the country there be about|4,000 person engage in collect gold there be every reason to believe that the number of person so employ have since be augment the exploration already make warrant the belief that the supply be very large and that gold be find at various place in an extensive district of country information receive from officer of the navy and other source though not so full and minute confirm the account of the commander of military force in california appear also from these report that mine of quicksilver be find in the vicinity of the gold region of be now be work and be believe to be among the most productive in the world the effect produce by the discovery of these rich mineral deposit and the success which have attend the labor of those who have resort to have produce a surprising change in the state of affair in california labor command a most exorbitant price and all other pursuit but that of search for the precious metal be abandon nearly the whole of the male population of the country have go to the gold district ship arrive on the coast be desert by crew and voyage suspend for want of sailor command officer there entertain apprehension that soldier can not be keep in the public service without a large increase of pay desertion in command have become frequent and recommend that those who shall withstand the strong temptation and remain faithful should be reward this abundance of gold and the all engross pursuit of have already cause in california an unprecedented rise in the price of all the necessary of life that may the more speedily and fully avail of the undeveloped wealth of these mine be deem of vast importance that a branch of the mint of the|united|state be authorize to be establish at present session in california among other signal advantage which would result from such an establishment would be that of raise the gold to par value in that territory a branch mint of the|united|state at the great commercial depot on the west coast would convert into own coin not only the gold derive from own rich mine but also the bullion and specie which commerce may bring from the whole west coast of central|and|south|america the west coast of america and the adjacent interior embrace the rich and good mine of mexico new|granada central|america chili and peru the bullion and specie draw from these country and especially from those of western mexico and peru to an amount in value of many|millions|of|dollar be now annually divert and carry by the ship of great|britain to own port to be recoine or use to sustain national bank and thus contribute to increase ability to command so much of the commerce of the world if a branch mint be establish at the great commercial point upon that coast a vast amount of bullion and specie would flow thither to be recoine and pass thence to new|orleans new|york and other atlantic city the amount of constitutional currency at home would be greatly increase while circulation abroad would be promote be well known to merchant trade to china and the west coast of america that great inconvenience and loss be experience from the fact that coin be not current at par value in those country the power of europe far remove from the west coast of america by the|atlantic|ocean which intervene and by a tedious and dangerous navigation around the southern cape of the continent of america can never successfully compete with the|united|state in the rich and extensive commerce which be open to at so much less cost by the acquisition of california the vast importance and commercial advantage of california have heretofore remain undeveloped by the government of the country of which constitute a part now that this fine province be a part of country all the|states|of|the|union some more immediately and directly than other be deeply interested in the speedy development of wealth and resource no section of country be more interested or will be more benefit than the commercial navigating and manufacture interest of the|eastern|state planting and farm interest in every part of the union will be greatly benefit by as commerce and navigation be enlarge and extend export of agricultural product and of manufacture will be increase and in the new market thus open can not fail to command remunerating and profitable price the acquisition of california and new|mexico the settlement of the oregon boundary and the annexation of texas extend to the|rio|grande be result which combine be of great consequence and will add more to the strength and wealth of the nation than any which have precede since the adoption of the constitution but to effect these great result not only california but new|mexico must be bring under the control of regularly organize government the exist condition of california and of that part of new|mexico lie west of the|rio|grande and without the limit of texas imperiously demand that congress should at present session organize territorial government over upon the exchange of ratification of the treaty of peace with mexico on the|30th|of|may|last the temporary government which have be establish over new|mexico and california by military and naval commander by virtue of the right of war cease to derive any obligatory force from that source of authority and have be cede to the|united|state all government and control over under the authority of mexico have cease to exist impressed with the necessity of establish territorial government over recommend the subject to the favorable consideration of congress in message communicate the ratified treaty of peace on the|6th|of|july|last and invoke action at that session congress adjourn without make any provision for government the inhabitant by the transfer of country have become entitled to the benefit of law and constitution and yet be leave without any regularly organize government since that time the very limited power possess by the executive have be exercise to preserve and protect from the inevitable consequence of a state of anarchy the only government which remain be that establish by the military authority during the war regard this to be a government and that by the presume consent of the inhabitant may be continue temporarily be advise to conform and submit to for the short intervene period before congress would again assemble and could legislate on the subject the view entertain by the executive on this point be contain in a communication of the secretary of state date the 7th of october last which be forward for publication to california and new|mexico a copy of which be herewith transmit the small military force of the|regular|army which be serve within the limit of the acquire territory at the close of the war be retain in and additional force have be order there for the protection of the inhabitant and to preserve and secure the right and interest of the|united|state no revenue have be or could be collect at the port in california because congress fail to authorize the establishment of custom house or the appointment of officer for that purpose the secretary of the treasury by a circular letter address to collector of the custom on the|7th|day|of|october|last a copy of which be herewith transmit exercise all the power with which be invest by law in pursuance of the act of the|14th|of|august last extend the benefit of post - office law to the people of california the|postmaster general have appoint agent who have proceed the to california and the other to oregon with authority to make the necessary arrangement for carry provision into effect the monthly line of mail steamer from panama to astoria have be require to stop and deliver and take mail at monterey and san|francisco these mail steamer connect by the|isthmus|of|panama with the line of mail steamer on the atlantic between new|york and chagres will establish a regular mail communication with california be solemn duty to provide with the least practicable delay for new|mexico and california regularly organize territorial government the cause of the failure to do this at the last session of congress be well known and deeply to be regret with the open prospect of increase prosperity and national greatness which the acquisition of these rich and extensive territorial possession afford how irrational would be to forego or to reject these advantage by the agitation of a domestic question which be coeval with the existence of government and to endanger by internal strife geographical division and heated contest for political power or for any other cause the harmony of the glorious union|of|our confederate states that union which bind together as people and which for sixty|years have be shield and protection against every danger in the eye of the world and of posterity how trivial and insignificant will be all internal division and struggle compare with the preservation of this|union|of|the|state in all vigor and with all countless blessing no patriot would foment and excite geographical and sectional division no lover of country would deliberately calculate the value of the union future generation would look in amazement upon the folly of such a course other nation at the|present|day would look upon with astonishment and such of as desire to maintain and perpetuate throne and monarchical or aristocratical principle will view with exultation and delight because in will see the element of faction which hope must ultimately overturn system be the great example of a prosperous and free self govern republic command the admiration and the imitation of all the lover of freedom throughout the world how solemn therefore be the duty how impressive the call upon and upon all part of country to cultivate a patriotic spirit of harmony of good fellowship of compromise and mutual concession in the administration of the incomparable system of government form by father in the midst of almost insuperable difficulty and transmit to with the injunction that should enjoy blessing and hand down unimpaire to those who may come after in view of the high and responsible duty which owe to and to mankind trust may be able at present session to approach the adjustment of the only domestic question which seriously threaten or probably ever can threaten to disturb the harmony and successful operation of system the immensely valuable possession of new|mexico and california be already inhabit by a considerable population attract by great fertility mineral wealth commercial advantage and the salubrity of the climate emigrant from the old states in great number be already prepare to seek new home in these invite region shall the dissimilarity of the domestic institution in the different state prevent from provide for suitable government these institution exist at the adoption of the constitution but the obstacle which interpose be overcome by that spirit of compromise which be now invoke in a conflict of opinion or of interest real or imaginary between different section of country neither can justly demand all which may desire to obtain each in the true spirit of institution should concede something to the other gallant force in the mexican war by whose patriotism and unparalleled deed of arm obtain these possession as an indemnity for just demand against mexico be compose of citizen who belong to no state or section of union be man from slaveholde and nonslaveholde states from the north and the south from the east and the west be all companion in arm and fellow citizen of the same common country engage in the same common cause when prosecute that war be brother and friend and share alike with each other common toil danger and suffering now when work be end when peace be restore and return again to home put off the habiliment of war take place in society and resume pursuit in civil life surely a spirit of harmony and concession and of equal regard for the right of all and of all section of the union ought to prevail in provide government for the acquire territory the fruit of common service the whole people of the|united|state and of every state contribute to defray the expense of that war and would not be just for any section to exclude another from all participation in the acquire territory this would not be in consonance with the just system of government which the framer of the constitution adopt the question be believe to be rather abstract than practical whether slavery ever can or would exist in any portion of the acquire territory even if be leave to the option of the slaveholde states from the nature of the climate and production in much the large portion of be certain could never exist and in the remainder the probability be would not but however this may be the question involve as do a principle of equality of right of the separate and several state as equal copartner in the confederacy should not be disregard in organize government over these territory no duty impose on congress by the constitution require that should legislate on the subject of slavery while power to do so be not only seriously question but deny by many of the sound expounder of that instrument whether congress shall legislate or not the people of the acquire territory when assemble in convention to form state constitution will possess the sole and exclusive power to determine for whether slavery shall or shall not exist within limit if congress shall abstain from interfere with the question the people of these territory will be leave free to adjust as may think proper when apply for admission as states into the union no enactment of congress could restrain the people of any of the sovereign states of the union old or new north|or|south slaveholde or nonslaveholde from determine the character of own domestic institution as may deem wise and proper any and all the states possess this right and congress can not deprive of the people of georgia may if choose so alter constitution as to abolish slavery within limit and the people of vermont may so alter constitution as to admit slavery within limit both state would possess the right though as all know be not probable that either would exert be fortunate for the peace and harmony of the union that this question be in nature temporary and can only continue for the brief period which will intervene before california and new|mexico may be admit as states into the union from the tide of population now flow into be highly probable that this will soon occur consider the several states and the citizen of the several states as equal and entitle to equal right under the constitution if this be an original question may well be insist on that the principle of noninterference be the true doctrine and that congress could not in the absence of any express grant of power interfere with relative right upon a great emergency however and under menacing danger to the union the missouri compromise line in respect to slavery be adopt the same line be extend farther west in the acquisition of texas after an acquiescence of nearly|thirty|years in the principle of compromise recognize and establish by these act and to avoid the danger to the union which may follow if be now disregard have heretofore express the opinion that that line of compromise should be extend on the parallel of ° from the western boundary of texas where now terminate to this be the middle ground of compromise upon which the different section of the union may meet as have heretofore meet if this be do be confidently believe a large majority of the people of every section of the country however widely abstract opinion on the subject of slavery may differ would cheerfully and patriotically acquiesce in and peace and harmony would again fill border the restriction north of the line be only yield to in the case of missouri and texas upon a principle of compromise make necessary for the sake of preserve the harmony and possibly the existence of the union be upon these consideration that at the close of last session give sanction to the principle of the missouri compromise line by approve and sign the bill to establish the territorial government of oregon from a sincere desire to preserve the harmony of the union and in deference for the act of predecessor feel constrain to yield acquiescence to the extent to which have go in compromise this delicate and dangerous question but if congress shall now reverse the decision by which the missouri compromise be effect and shall propose to extend the restriction over the whole territory south as well as north of the parallel of ° will cease to be a compromise and must be regard as an original question if congress instead of observe the course of noninterference leave the adoption of own domestic institution to the people who may inhabit these territory or if instead of extend the missouri compromise line to the pacific shall prefer to submit the legal and constitutional question which may arise to the decision of the judicial tribunal as be propose in a bill which pass the senate at last session an adjustment may be effect in this mode if the whole subject be refer to the judiciary all part of the union should cheerfully acquiesce in the final decision of the tribunal create by the constitution for the settlement of all question which may arise under the constitution treaty and law of the|united|state congress be earnestly invoke for the sake of the union harmony and continued prosperity as a nation to adjust at present session this the only dangerous question which lie in path if not in some of the mode suggest in some other which may be satisfactory in anticipation of the establishment of regular government over the acquire territory a joint commission of officer of the army and navy have be order to proceed to the coast of california and oregon for the purpose of make reconnaissance and a report as to the proper site for the erection of fortification or other defensive work on land and of suitable situation for naval station the information which may be expect from a scientific and skillful examination of the whole face of the coast will be eminently useful to congress when come to consider the propriety of make appropriation for these great national object proper defense on land will be necessary for the security and protection of possession and the establishment of navy yard and a dock for the repair and construction of vessel will be important alike to navy and commercial marine without such establishment every vessel whether of the navy or of the merchant service require repair must at great expense come round cape|horn to of atlantic yard for that purpose with such establishment vessel be believe may be build or repair as cheaply in california as upon the atlantic coast would give employment to many of enterprise shipbuilder and mechanic and greatly facilitate and enlarge commerce in the pacific as be ascertain that mine of gold silver copper and quicksilver exist in new|mexico and california and that nearly all the land where be find belong to the|united|state be deem important to the public interest that provision be make for a geological and mineralogical examination of these region measure should be adopt to preserve the mineral land especially such as contain the precious metal for the use of the|united|state or if bring into market to separate from the farming land and dispose of in such manner as to secure a large return of money to the treasury and at the same time to lead to the development of wealth by individual proprietor and purchaser to do this will be necessary to provide for an immediate survey and location of the lot if congress should deem proper to dispose of the mineral land should be sell in small quantity and at a fix minimum price recommend that surveyor general 's office be authorize to be establish in new|mexico and california and provision make for surveying and bring the public land into market at the early practicable period in disposing of these land recommend that the right of preemption be secure and liberal grant make to the early emigrant who have settle or may settle upon will be important to extend revenue law over these territory and especially over california at an early period there be already a considerable commerce with california and until port of entry shall be establish and collector appoint no revenue can be receive if these and other necessary and proper measure be adopt for the development of the wealth and resource of new|mexico and california and regular territorial government be establish over such will probably be the rapid enlargement of commerce and navigation and such the addition to the national wealth that the present generation may live to witness the control commercial and monetary power of the world transfer from london and other european emporium to the city of new|york the apprehension which be entertain by some of statesman in the early period of the government that system be incapable of operate with sufficient energy and success over largely extend territorial limit and that if this be attempt would fall to piece by own weakness have be dissipate by experience by the division of power between the|states|and|federal|government the latter be find to operate with as much energy in the extreme as in the center be as efficient in the remotest of the states which now compose the union as be in the states which form constitution indeed may well be doubt whether if present population have be confine within the limit of the original states the tendency to centralization and consolidation would not have be such as to have encroach upon the essential reserve right of the states and thus to have make the|federal|government a widely different one practically from what be in theory and be intend to be by framer so far from entertain apprehension of the safety of system by the extension of territory the belief be confidently entertain that each new state give strength and an additional guaranty for the preservation of the union in pursuance of the provision of the thirteenth article of the treaty of peace friendship limit and settlement with the|republic|of|mexico and of the act of july|29,|1848 claim of citizen which have be already liquidate and decide against the|mexican|republic amount with the interest thereon to have be liquidate and pay there remain to be pay of these claim congress at last session have make no provision for execute the fifteenth article of the treaty by which the|united|state assume to make satisfaction for the unliquidated claim of citizen against mexico to an amount not exceed three|and|a|quarter millions|of|dollar the subject be again recommend to favorable consideration the exchange of ratification of the treaty with mexico take place on the|30th|of|may,|1848 within one|year after that time the commissioner and surveyor which each government stipulate to appoint be require to meet at the port of and proceed to run and mark the say boundary in whole course to the mouth of the rio bravo del norte will be see from this provision that the period within which a commissioner and surveyor of the respective government be to meet at will expire on the|30th|of|may,|1849 congress at the close of last session make an appropriation for the expense of run and mark the boundary line between the country but do not fix the amount of salary which should be pay to the commissioner and surveyor to be appoint on the part of the|united|state be desirable that the amount of compensation which shall receive should be prescribe by law and not leave as at present to executive discretion measure be adopt at the early practicable period to organize the territorial government of oregon as authorize by the act of the|14th|of|august last the governor and marshal of the territory accompany by a small military escort leave the frontier of missouri in september last and take the southern route by the way of santa|fe and the river gila to california with the intention of proceed thence in of vessel of war to destination the governor be fully advise of the great importance of early arrival in the country and be confidently believe may reach oregon in the latter part of the|present|month or early in the next the other officer for the territory have proceed by sea in the|month|of|may last communicate information to congress that an indian war have break out in oregon and recommend that authority be give to raise an adequate number of volunteer to proceed without delay to the assistance of fellow citizen in that territory the authority to raise such a force not have be grant by congress as soon as service could be dispense with in mexico order be issue to the regiment of mount rifleman to proceed to jefferson|barracks in missouri and to prepare to march to oregon as soon as the necessary provision could be make shortly before be ready to march be arrest by the provision of the act pass by congress on the|last|day of the last session which direct that all the noncommissioned officer musician and private of that regiment who have be in service in mexico should upon application be entitle to be discharge the effect of this provision be to disband the rank and file of the regiment and before place could be fill by recruit the|season have so far advanced that be impracticable for to proceed until the opening of the|next|spring in the|month|of|october last the accompany communication be receive from the governor of the temporary government of oregon give information of the continuance of the indian disturbance and of the destitution and defenseless condition of the inhabitant order be immediately transmit to the commander of squadron in the pacific to dispatch to assistance a part of the naval force on that station to furnish with arm and ammunition and to continue to give such aid and protection as the navy could afford until the army could reach the country be the policy of humanity and one which have always be pursue by the|united|state to cultivate the good will of the aboriginal tribe of this continent and to restrain from make war and indulge in excess by mild mean rather than by force that this could have be do with the tribe in oregon have that territory be bring under the government of law at an early period and have other suitable measure be adopt by congress such as now exist in intercourse with the other indian tribe within limit can not be doubt indeed the immediate and only cause of the exist hostility of the indians of oregon be represent to have be the long delay of the|united|state in make to some trifling compensation in such article as want for the country now occupy by emigrant which the indians claim and over which formerly roam this compensation have be promise to by the temporary government establish in oregon but fulfillment have be postpone from time to time for nearly|two|year whilst those who make have be anxiously wait for congress to establish a territorial government over the country the indians become at length distrustful of good faith and seek redress by plunder and massacre which finally lead to the present difficulty a|few|thousand|dollar in suitable present as a compensation for the country which have be take possession of by citizen would have satisfy the indians and have prevent the war a small amount properly distribute be confidently believe would soon restore quiet in this indian war fellow citizen of oregon have be compel to take the field in own defense have perform valuable military service and be subject to expense which have fall heavily upon justice demand that provision should be make by congress to compensate for service and to refund to the necessary expense which have incur repeat the recommendation heretofore make to congress that provision be make for the appointment of a suitable number of indian agent to reside among the tribe of oregon and that a small sum be appropriate to enable these agent to cultivate friendly relation with if this be do the presence of a small military force will be all that be necessary to keep in check and preserve peace recommend that similar provision be make as regard the tribe inhabit northern texas new|mexico california and the extensive region lie between settlement in missouri and these possession as the most effective mean of preserve peace upon border and within the recently acquire territory the secretary of the treasury will present in annual report a highly satisfactory statement of the condition of the finance the import for the|fiscal|year|ending|on|the|30th|of|june|last be of the value of of which the amount export be leave in the country for domestic use the value of the export for the same period be consist of domestic production amount to and of foreign article the receipt into the treasury for the same period exclusive of loan amount to of which there be derive from custom from sale of public land and from miscellaneous and incidental source will be perceive that the revenue from custom for the|last|fiscal|year exceed by the estimate of the secretary of the treasury in last annual report and that the aggregate receipt during the same period from custom land and miscellaneous source also exceed the estimate by the sum of indicate however a very near approach in the estimate to the actual result the expenditure during the|fiscal|year|ending|on|the|30th|of|june|last include those for the war and exclusive of payment of principal and interest for the public debt be be estimate that the receipt into the treasury for the|fiscal|year|ending|on|the|30th|of|june,|1849 include the balance in the treasury on the|1st|of|july|last will amount to the sum of of which be estimate will be derive from custom from the sale of the public land and from miscellaneous and incidental source include the premium upon the loan and the amount pay and to be pay into the treasury on account of military contribution in mexico and the sale of arm and vessel and other public property render unnecessary for the use of the government by the termination of the war and from loan already negotiate include treasury note fund which together with the balance in the treasury on the|1st|of|july|last make the sum estimate the expenditure for the same period include the necessary payment on account of the principal and interest of the public debt and the principal and interest of the first installment due to mexico on the|30th|of|may next and other expenditure grow out of the war to be pay during the|present|year will amount include the reimbursement of treasury note to the sum of leave an estimate balance in the treasury on the|1st|of|july,|1849 of the secretary of the treasury will present as require by law the estimate of the receipt and expenditure for the|next|fiscal|year the expenditure as estimate for that|year be include for the interest on the public debt and for the principal and interest due to mexico on the|30th|of|may,|1850 leave the sum of which be believe will be ample for the ordinary peace expenditure the operation of the tariff act of have be such during the|past|year as fully to meet the public expectation and to confirm the opinion heretofore express of the wisdom of the change in revenue system which be effect by the receipt under into the treasury for the|first|fiscal|year after enactment exceed by the sum of the amount collect during the|last|fiscal|year under the tariff act of end the|30th|of|june,|1846 the total revenue realize from the commencement of operation on the|1st|of|december,|1846 until the close of the|last|quarter on the|30th|of|september|last be two|month be be a much large sum than be ever before receive from duty during any equal period under the tariff act of and whilst by the repeal of highly protective and prohibitory duty the revenue have be increase the taxis on the people have be diminish have be relieve from the heavy amount with which be burthen under former law in the form of increase price or bounty pay to favor class and pursuit the prediction which be make that the tariff act of would reduce the amount of revenue below that collect under the act of and would prostrate the business and destroy the prosperity of the country have not be verify with an increased and increase revenue the finance be in a highly flourishing condition agriculture commerce and navigation be prosperous the price of manufacture fabric and of other product be much less injuriously affect than be to have be anticipate from the unprecedented revulsion which during the last and the|present|year have overwhelm the industry and paralyze the credit and commerce of so many great and enlighten nation of europe severe commercial revulsion abroad have always heretofore operate to depress and often to affect disastrously almost every branch of american industry the temporary depression of a portion of manufacturing interest be the effect of foreign cause and be far less severe than have prevail on all former similar occasion be believe that look to the great aggregate of all interest the whole country be never more prosperous than at the present period and never more rapidly advance in wealth and population neither the foreign war in which have be involve nor the loan which have absorb so large a portion of capital nor the commercial revulsion in great|britain in nor the paralysis of credit and commerce throughout europe in have affect injuriously to any considerable extent any of the great interest of the country or arrest onward march to greatness wealth and power have the disturbance in europe not occur commerce would undoubtedly have be still more extended and would have add still more to the national wealth and public prosperity but notwithstanding these disturbance the operation of the revenue system establish by the tariff act of have be so generally beneficial to the government and the business of the country that no change in provision be demand by a wise public policy and none be recommend the operation of the constitutional treasury establish by the act of the 6th of august in the receipt custody and disbursement of the public money have continue to be successful under this system the public finance have be carry through a foreign war involve the necessity of loan and extraordinary expenditure and require distant transfer and disbursement without embarrassment and no loss have occur of any of the public money deposit under provision whilst have prove to be safe and useful to the government effect have be most beneficial upon the business of the country have tend powerfully to secure an exemption from that inflation and fluctuation of the paper currency so injurious to domestic industry and render so uncertain the reward of labor and be believe have largely contribute to preserve the whole country from a serious commercial revulsion such as often occur under the bank deposit system in the|year|1847 there be a revulsion in the business of of great extent and intensity which be follow by failure in that kingdom unprecedented in number and amount of loss this be believe to be the first instance when such disastrous bankruptcy occur in a country with which have such extensive commerce produce little or no injurious effect upon trade or currency remain but little affected in money market and business and industry be still prosperous and progressive during the|present|year nearly the whole continent of europe have be convulse by civil war and revolution attend by numerous bankruptcy by an unprecedented fall in public security and an almost universal paralysis of commerce and industry and yet although trade and the price of product must have be somewhat unfavorably affect by these cause have escape a revulsion money market be comparatively easy and public and private credit have advance and improve be confidently believe that have be save from effect by the salutary operation of the constitutional treasury be certain that if the four|million of specie import into the country during have go into the bank as to a great extent must have do would in the absence of this system have be make the basis of augmented bank paper issue probably to an amount not less|than|$60,000,000 or produce as an inevitable consequence of an inflated currency extravagant price for a time and wild speculation which must have be follow on the reflux to europe the succeed year of so much of that specie by the prostration of the business of the country the suspension of the bank and most extensive bankruptcy occur as this would have do at a period when the country be engage in a foreign war when considerable loan of specie be require for distant disbursement and when the bank the fiscal agent of the government and the depository of money be suspend the public credit must have sink and many|millions|of|dollar as be the case during the|war|of|1812 must have be sacrifice in discount upon loan and upon the depreciated paper currency which the government would have be compel to use under the operation of the constitutional treasury not a dollar have be lose by the depreciation of the currency the loan require to prosecute the war with mexico be negotiate by the secretary of the treasury above par realize a large premium to the government the restrain effect of the system upon the tendency to excessive paper issue by bank have save the government from heavy loss and thousand of business man from bankruptcy and ruin the wisdom of the system have be test by the experience of the|last|two|year and be the dictate of sound policy that should remain undisturbed the modification in some of the detail of this measure involve none of essential principle heretofore recommend be again present for favorable consideration in message of the last transmit to congress the ratified treaty of peace with mexico recommend the adoption of measure for the speedy payment of the public debt in reiterate that recommendation refer to the consideration present in that message in support the public debt include that authorize to be negotiate in pursuance of exist law and include treasury note amount at that time to fund stock of the|united|state amount to about|half|a|million of dollar have be purchase as authorize by law since that period and the public debt have thus be reduce the detail of which will be present in the annual report of the secretary of the treasury the estimate of expenditure for the|next|fiscal|year submit by the secretary of the treasury be believe will be ample for all necessary purpose if the appropriation make by congress shall not exceed the amount estimate the mean in the treasury will be sufficient to defray all the expense of the government to pay off the next installment of to mexico which will fall due on the|30th|of|may next and still a considerable surplus will remain which should be apply to the further purchase of the public stock and reduction of the debt should enlarged appropriation be make the necessary consequence will be to postpone the payment of the debt though debt as compare with that of most other nation be small be true policy and in harmony with the genius of institution that should present to the world the rare spectacle of a great republic possess vast resource and wealth wholly exempt from public indebtedness this would add still more to strength and give to a still more commanding position among the nation of the earth the public expenditure should be economical and be confine to such necessary object as be clearly within the power of congress all such as be not absolutely demand should be postpone and the payment of the public debt at the early practicable period should be a cardinal principle of public policy for the reason assign in last annual message repeat the recommendation that a branch of the mint of the|united|state be establish at the city of new|york the importance of this measure be greatly increase by the acquisition of the rich mine of the precious metal in new|mexico and california and especially in the latter repeat the recommendation heretofore make in favor of the graduation and reduction of the price of such of the public land as have be long offer in the market and have remain unsold and in favor of extend the right of preemption to actual settler on the unsurveyed as well as the survey land the condition and operation of the army and the state of other branch of the public service under the supervision of the|war|department be satisfactorily present in the accompanying report of the secretary of war on the return of peace force be withdraw from mexico and the volunteer and that portion of the|regular|army engage for the war be disband order have be issue for station the force of permanent establishment at various position in extended country where troop may be require owe to the remoteness of some of these position the detachment have not yet reach destination notwithstanding the extension of the limit of country and the force require in the new territory be confidently believe that present military establishment be sufficient for all exigency so long as peaceful relation remain undisturbed of the amount of military contribution collect in mexico the sum of be apply toward the payment of the first installment due under the treaty with mexico the further sum of have be pay into the treasury and unexpended balance still remain in the hand of disburse officer and those who be engage in the collection of these money after the proclamation of peace no further disbursement be make of any unexpended money arise from this source the balance on hand be direct to be pay into the treasury and individual claim on the fund will remain unadjusted until congress shall authorize settlement and payment these claim be not considerable in number or amount recommend to favorable consideration the suggestion of the secretary of war and the secretary of the navy in regard to legislation on this subject indian relation be present in a most favorable view in the report from the wisdom of policy in regard to the tribe within limit be clearly manifest by improve and rapidly improve condition a most important treaty with the menomonies have be recently negotiate by the commissioner of indian|affairs in person by which all land in the|state|of|wisconsin be about|4,000,000|acre have be cede to the|united|state this treaty will be submit to the senate for ratification at an early period of present session within the|last|four|years|eight important treaty have be negotiate with different indian tribe and at a cost of indian land to the amount of more|than|18,500,000|acre have be cede to the|united|state and provision have be make for settle in the country west of the mississippi the tribe which occupy this large extent of the public domain the title to all the indian land within the several states of union with the exception of a few small reservation be now extinguish and a vast region open for settlement and cultivation the accompanying report of the secretary of the navy give a satisfactory exhibit of the operation and condition of that branch of the public service a number of small vessel suitable for enter the mouth of river be judiciously purchase during the war and give great efficiency to the squadron in the|gulf|of|mexico on the return of peace when no longer valuable for naval purpose and liable to constant deterioration be sell and the money place in the treasury the number of man in the naval service authorize by law during the war have be reduce by discharge below the maximum fix for the peace establishment adequate squadron be maintain in the|several|quarters of the globe where experience have show service may be most usefully employ and the naval service be never in a condition of high discipline or great efficiency invite attention to the recommendation of the secretary of the navy on the subject of the|marine|corps the reduction of the corps at the end of the war require that officer of each of the low grade should be drop from the roll a board of officer make the selection and those designate be necessarily dismiss but without any alleged fault concur in opinion with the secretary that the service would be improve by reduce the number of landsman and increase the marine such a measure would justify an increase of the number of officer to the extent of the reduction by dismissal and still the corps would have few officer than a corresponding number of man in the army the contract for the transportation of the mail in steamship convertible into war steamer promise to realize all the benefit to commerce and to the navy which be anticipate the first steamer thus secure to the government be launch in january,|1847 there be now and in another|year there will probably be not less than afloat while this great national advantage be secure social and commercial intercourse be increase and promote with germany great|britain and other part of europe with all the country on the west coast of continent especially with oregon and california and between the northern and southern section of the|united|state considerable revenue may be expect from postage but the connected line from new|york to chagre and thence across the isthmus to oregon can not fail to exert a beneficial influence not now to be estimate on the interest of the manufacture commerce navigation and currency of the|united|state as an important part of the system recommend to favorable consideration the establishment of the propose line of steamer between new|orleans and vera|cruz promise the most happy result in cement friendship between the republics and extend reciprocal benefit to the trade and manufacture of both the report of the|postmaster general will make known to the operation of that department for the|past|year be gratify to find the revenue of the department under the rate of postage now establish by law so rapidly increase the gross amount of postage during the|last|fiscal|year amount to exceed the annual average receive for the|nine|years immediately precede the passage of the act of the|3d|of|march by the sum of and exceed the amount receive for the|year|ending|the|30th|of|june,|1847 by the sum of the expenditure for the|year exclude the sum of allow by congress at last session to individual claimant and include the sum of pay for the service of the line of steamer between bremen and new|york amount to which be less than the annual average for the|nine|years previous to the act of by the mail route on the|30th|day|of|june|last be in extent be an increase during the|last|year of the mail be transport over during the same time make an increase of transportation for the|year of whilst the expense be less than that of the|previous|year by the increase in the mail transportation within the|last|three|years have be 5,378,310|mile whilst the expense be reduce make an increase of service at the rate of and a reduction in the expense of more|than|15 per cent during the|past|year there have be employ under contract with the|post office|department ocean steamer in convey the mail monthly between new|york and bremen and since october last perform semimonthly service between charleston and havana and a contract have be make for the transportation of the pacific mail across the isthmus from chagres to panama under the authority give to the secretary of the navy ocean steamer have be construct and send to the pacific and be expect to enter upon the mail service between panama and oregon and the intermediate port on the|1st|of|january|next and a fourth have be engage by for the service between havana and chagres so that a regular monthly mail line will be keep up after that time between the|united|state and territory on the pacific notwithstanding this great increase in the mail service should the revenue continue to increase the|present|year as do in the last there will be receive near more than the expenditure these consideration have satisfy the postmaster general that with certain modification of the act of the revenue may be still further increase and a reduction of postage make to a uniform rate of without an interference with the principle which have be constantly and properly enforce of make that department sustain a well digest cheap postage system be the good mean of diffuse intelligence among the people and be of so much importance in a country so extensive as that of the|united|state that recommend to favorable consideration the suggestion of the|postmaster general for improvement nothing can retard the onward progress of country and prevent from assume and maintain the first rank among nation but a disregard of the experience of the past and a recurrence to an unwise public policy have just close a foreign war by an honorable peace a war render necessary and unavoidable in vindication of the national right and honor the present condition of the country be similar in some respect to that which exist immediately after the close of the war with great|britain in and the occasion be deem to be a proper one to take a retrospect of the measure of public policy which follow that war there be at that period of history a departure from early policy the enlargement of the power of the|federal|government by construction which obtain be not warrant by any just interpretation of the constitution a|few|year after the close of that war a series of measure be adopt which unite and combine constitute what be term by author and advocate the american system the introduction of the new policy be for a time favor by the condition of the country by the heavy debt which have be contract during the war by the depression of the public credit by the derange state of the finance and the currency and by the commercial and pecuniary embarrassment which extensively prevail these be not the only cause which lead to establishment the event of the war with great|britain and the embarrassment which have attend prosecution have leave on the mind of many of statesman the impression that government be not strong enough and that to wield resource successfully in great emergency and especially in war more power should be concentrate in hand this increase power do not seek to obtain by the legitimate and prescribed mode an amendment of the constitution but by construction see government in the old world base upon different order of society and so constitute as to throw the whole power of nation into the hand of a few who tax and control the many without responsibility or restraint in that arrangement conceive the strength of nation in war consist there be also something fascinating in the ease luxury and display of the high order who draw wealth from the toil of the laboring million the author of the system draw idea of political economy from what have witness in europe and particularly in great|britain have view the enormous wealth concentrate in few hand and have see the splendor of the overgrown establishment of an aristocracy which be uphold by the restrictive policy forget to look down upon the poor class of the english population upon whose daily and yearly labor the great establishment so much admire be sustain and support fail to perceive that the scantily fed and half clothe operative be not only in abject poverty but be bind in chain of oppressive servitude for the benefit of favor class who be the exclusive object of the care of the government be not possible to reconstruct society in the|united|state upon the european plan here there be a write constitution by which order and title be not recognize or tolerate a system of measure be therefore devise calculate if not intend to withdraw power gradually and silently from the states and the mass of the people and by construction to approximate government to the european model substitute an aristocracy of wealth for that of order and title without reflect upon the dissimilarity of institution and of the condition of people and those of europe conceive the vain idea of build up in the|united|state a system similar to that which admire abroad great|britain have a national bank of large capital in whose hand be concentrate the control monetary and financial power of the nation an institution wield almost kingly power and exert vast influence upon all the operation of trade and upon the policy of the government great|britain have an enormous public debt and have become a part of public policy to regard this as a public blessing great|britain have also a restrictive policy which place fetter and burden on trade and trammel the productive industry of the mass of the nation by combined system of policy the landlord and other property holder be protect and enrich by the enormous taxis which be levy upon the labor of the country for advantage imitate this foreign policy the first step in establish the new system in the|united|state be the creation of a national bank not foresee the dangerous power and countless evil which such an institution may entail on the country nor perceive the connection which be design to form between the bank and the other branch of the miscall american system but feel the embarrassment of the treasury and of the business of the country consequent upon the war some of statesman who have hold different and sounder view be induce to yield scruple and indeed settle conviction of unconstitutionality and to give sanction as an expedient which vainly hope may produce relief be a most unfortunate error as the subsequent history and final catastrophe of that dangerous and corrupt institution have abundantly prove the bank with numerous branch ramify into the states soon bring many of the active political and commercial man in different section of the country into the relation of debtor to and dependent upon for pecuniary favor thus diffuse throughout the mass of society a great number of individual of power and influence to give tone to public opinion and to act in concert in case of emergency the corrupt power of such a political engine be no longer a matter of speculation have be display in numerous instance but most signally in the political struggle of and in opposition to the public will represent by a fearless and patriotic president but the bank be but branch of the new system a public debt of exist and be not to be disguise that many of the author of the new system do not regard speedy payment as essential to the public prosperity but look upon continuance as no national evil whilst the debt exist furnish aliment to the national bank and render increase taxation necessary to the amount of the interest exceed annually this operate in harmony with the next branch of the new system which be a high protective tariff this be to afford bounty to favor class and particular pursuit at the expense of all other a proposition to tax the whole people for the purpose of enrich a few be too monstrous to be openly make the scheme be therefore veil under the plausible but delusive pretext of a measure to protect home industry and many of people be for a time lead to believe that a tax which in the main fall upon labor be for the benefit of the laborer who pay this branch of the system involve a partnership between the government and the favor class the former receive the proceed of the tax impose on article import and the latter the increase price of similar article produce at home cause by such tax be obvious that the portion to be receive by the favor class would as a general rule be increase in proportion to the increase of the rate of tax impose and diminish as those rate be reduce to the revenue standard require by the want of the government the rate require to produce a sufficient revenue for the ordinary expenditure of government for necessary purpose be not likely to give to the private partner in this scheme profit sufficient to satisfy cupidity and hence a variety of expedient and pretext be resort to for the purpose of enlarge the expenditure and thereby create a necessity for keep up a high protective tariff the effect of this policy be to interpose artificial restriction upon the natural course of the business and trade of the country and to advance the interest of large capitalist and monopolist at the expense of the great mass of the people who be tax to increase wealth another branch of this system be a comprehensive scheme of internal improvement capable of indefinite enlargement and sufficient to swallow up as|many|millions annually as could be exact from the foreign commerce of the country this be a convenient and necessary adjunct of the protective tariff be to be the great absorbent of any surplus which may at any time accumulate in the treasury and of the taxis levy on the people not for necessary revenue purpose but for the avow object of afford protection to the favor class auxiliary to the same end if be not an essential part of the system be the scheme which at a later period obtain for distribute the proceed of the sale of the public land among the states other expedient be devise to take money out of the treasury and prevent come in from any other source than the protective tariff the author and supporter of the system be the advocate of the large expenditure whether for necessary or useful purpose or not because the large the expenditure the great be the pretext for high taxis in the form of protective duty these several measure be sustain by popular name and plausible argument by which thousand be delude the bank be represent to be an indispensable fiscal agent for the government be to equalize exchange and to regulate and furnish a sound currency always and everywhere of uniform value the protective tariff be to give employment to american labor at advanced price be to protect home industry and furnish a steady market for the farmer internal improvement be to bring trade into every neighborhood and enhance the value of every man 's property the distribution of the land money be to enrich the states finish public work plant school throughout border and relieve from taxation but the fact that for every dollar take out of the treasury for these object a much large sum be transfer from the pocket of the people to the favor class be carefully conceal as be also the tendency if not the ultimate design of the system to build up an aristocracy of wealth to control the masse of society and monopolize the political power of the country the several branch of this system be so intimately blend together that in operation each sustain and strengthen the other joint operation be to add new burthen of taxation and to encourage a largely increased and wasteful expenditure of public money be the interest of the bank that the revenue collect and the disbursement make by the government should be large because be the depository of the public money the large the amount the great would be the bank profit by use be the interest of the favor class who be enrich by the protective tariff to have the rate of that protection as high as possible for the high those rate the great would be advantage be the interest of the people of all those section and locality who expect to be benefit by expenditure for internal improvement that the amount collect should be as large as possible to the end that the sum disburse may also be the large the states be the beneficiary in the distribution of the land money have an interest in have the rate of tax impose by the protective tariff large enough to yield a sufficient revenue from that source to meet the want of the government without disturb or take from the land fund so that each of the branch constitute the system have a common interest in swell the public expenditure have a direct interest in maintain the public debt unpaid and increase amount because this would produce an annual increase drain upon the treasury to the amount of the interest and render augmented taxis necessary the operation and necessary effect of the whole system be to encourage large and extravagant expenditure and thereby to increase the public patronage and maintain a rich and splendid government at the expense of a taxed and impoverished people be manifest that this scheme of enlarged taxation and expenditure have continue to prevail must soon have convert the|government|of|the|union intend by framer to be a plain cheap and simple confederation of states unite together for common protection and charge with a few specific duty relate chiefly to foreign affair into a consolidated empire deprive the states of reserve right and the people of just power and control in the administration of government in this manner the whole form and character of the government would be change not by an amendment of the constitution but by resort to an unwarrantable and unauthorized construction of that instrument the indirect mode of levy the taxis by a duty on import prevent the mass of the people from readily perceive the amount pay and have enable the few who be thus enrich and who seek to wield the political power of the country to deceive and delude be the taxis collect by a direct levy upon the people as be the ease in the states this could not occur the whole system be resist from inception by many of ablest statesman some of whom doubt constitutionality and expediency while other believe be in all branch a flagrant and dangerous infraction of the constitution that a national bank a protective tariff levy not to raise the revenue need but for protection merely internal improvement and the distribution of the proceed of the sale of the public land be measure without the warrant of the constitution would upon the mature consideration seem to be clear be remarkable that no one of these measure involve such momentous consequence be authorize by any express grant of power in the constitution no one of be incident to as be necessary and proper for the execution of the specific power grant by the constitution the authority under which have be attempt to justify each of be derive from inference and construction of the constitution which letter and whole object and design do not warrant be to be conceive that such immense power would have be leave by the framer of the constitution to mere inference and doubtful construction have be intend to confer on the|federal|government be but reasonable to conclude that would have be do by plain and unequivocal grant this be not do but the whole structure of which the american system consist be rear on no other or well foundation than force implication and inference of power which author assume may be deduce by construction from the constitution but have be urge that the national bank which constitute so essential a branch of this combined system of measure be not a new measure and that constitutionality have be previously sanction because a bank have be charter in and have receive the official signature of president washington a few fact will show the just weight to which this precedent should be entitle as bear upon the question of constitutionality great division of opinion upon the subject exist in congress be well know that president washington entertain serious doubt both as to the constitutionality and expediency of the measure and while the bill be before for official approval or disapproval so great be these doubt that require the opinion in writing of the member of cabinet to aid in arrive at a decision cabinet give opinion and be divide upon the subject general hamilton be in favor of and mr. jefferson and mr. randolph be oppose to the constitutionality and expediency of the bank be well know also that president washington retain the bill from monday the|14th when be present to until friday the|25th|of|february be the last moment permit by the constitution to deliberate when finally yield to reluctant assent and give signature be certain that as late as the 23d of february be the|ninth|day after the bill be present to have arrive at no satisfactory conclusion for on that|day address a note to general hamilton in which inform that this bill be present to by the joint committee of congress at on monday the 14th instant and request opinion to what precise period by legal interpretation of the constitution can the president retain in possession before become a law by the lapse of ten|day if the proper construction be that the|day on which the bill be present to the president and the|day on which action be have upon be both to be count inclusive then the time allow within which would be competent for to return to the house in which originate with objection would expire on thursday the|24th|of|february general hamilton on the|same|day return an answer in which state give as opinion that have ten|day exclusive of that on which the bill be deliver to and sundays hence in the present case if be return on friday will be in time by this construction which the president adopt gain another|day for deliberation and be not until the|25th|of|february that sign the bill thus afford conclusive proof that have at last obtain own consent to sign not without great and almost insuperable difficulty additional light have be recently shed upon the serious doubt which have on the subject amount at time to a conviction that be duty to withhold approval from the bill this be find among the manuscript paper of mr. madison authorize to be purchase for the use of the government by an act of the last session of congress and now for the first time accessible to the public from these paper appear that president washington while yet hold the bank bill in hand actually request mr. madison at that time a member of the|house|of|representatives to prepare the draft of a veto message for mr. madison at request do prepare the draft of such a message and send to on the|21st|of|february,|1791 a copy of this original draft in mr. madison 's own handwriting be carefully preserve by and be among the paper lately purchase by congress be precede by a note write on the same sheet which be also in mr. madison 's handwriting and be as follow of a paper make out and send to the president at request to be ready in case judgment should finally decide against the bill for incorporate a national bank the bill be then before among the objection assign in this paper to the bill and which be submit for the consideration of the president be the follow object to the bill because be an essential principle of the government that power not delegate by the constitution can not be rightfully exercise because the power propose by the bill to be exercise be not expressly delegate and because can not satisfy that result from any express power by fair and safe rule of interpretation the weight of the precedent of the bank of and the sanction of the great name of washington which have be so often invoke in support be greatly weaken by the development of these fact the experiment of that bank satisfy the country that ought not to be continue and at the|end|of|twenty|years congress refuse to recharter would have be fortunate for the country and save thousand from bankruptcy and ruin have public man of resist the temporary pressure of the time upon financial and pecuniary interest and refuse to charter the second bank of this the country become abundantly satisfied and at the close of twenty|years ' duration as in the case of the first bank also cease to exist under the repeat blow of president jackson reel and fall and a subsequent attempt to charter a similar institution be arrest by the veto of president tyler mr. madison in yield signature to the charter of do so upon the ground of the respect due to precedent and as subsequently declared-- the|bank|of|the|united|state though on the original question hold to be unconstitutional receive the executive signature be probable that neither the bank of nor that of would have be charter but for the embarrassment of the government in finance the derangement of the currency and the pecuniary pressure which exist the first the consequence of the|war|of|the|revolution and the second the consequence of the|war|of|1812 both be resort to in the delusive hope that would restore public credit and afford relief to the government and to the business of the country those of public man who oppose the whole american system at commencement and throughout progress foresaw and predict that be fraught with incalculable mischief and must result in serious injury to the good interest of the country for a|series|of|year wise counsel be unheeded and the system be establish be soon apparent that practical operation be unequal and unjust upon different portion of the country and upon the people engage in different pursuit all be equally entitle to the favor and protection of the government foster and elevate the money power and enrich the favor few by tax labor and at the expense of the many effect be to make the rich rich and the poor poorer tendency be to create distinction in society base on wealth and to give to the favor class undue control and sway in government be an organized money power which resist the popular will and seek to shape and control the public policy under the pernicious working of this combined system of measure the country witness alternate season of temporary apparent prosperity of sudden and disastrous commercial revulsion of unprecedented fluctuation of price and depression of the great interest of agriculture navigation and commerce of general pecuniary suffering and of final bankruptcy of thousand after a severe struggle of more|than|a|quarter|of|a|century the system be overthrow the bank have be succeed by a practical system of finance conduct and control solely by the government the constitutional currency have be restore the public credit maintain unimpaire even in a period of a foreign war and the whole country have become satisfied that bank national or state be not necessary as fiscal agent of the government revenue duty have take the place of the protective tariff the distribution of the money derive from the sale of the public land have be abandon and the corrupt system of internal improvement be hope have be effectually check be not doubt that if this whole train of measure design to take wealth from the many and bestow upon the few be to prevail the effect would be to change the entire character of the government only danger remain be the seduction of that branch of the system which consist in internal improvement hold out as do inducement to the people of particular section and locality to embark the government in without stop to calculate the inevitable consequence this branch of the system be so intimately combine and link with the other that as surely as an effect be produce by an adequate cause if be resuscitate and revive and firmly establish require no sagacity to foresee that will necessarily and speedily draw after the reestablishment of a national bank the revival of a protective tariff the distribution of the land money and not only the postponement to the distant future of the payment of the present national debt but annual increase entertain the solemn conviction that if the internal improvement branch of the american system be not firmly resist at this time the whole series of measure compose will be speedily reestablish and the country be throw back from present high state of prosperity which the exist policy have produce and be destine again to witness all the evil commercial revulsion depression of price and pecuniary embarrassment through which have pass during the last five|year to guard against consequence so ruinous be an object of high national importance involve in judgment the continued prosperity of the country have feel to be an imperative obligation to withhold constitutional sanction from bill which have pass the houses|of|congress involve the principle of the internal improvement branch of the american system and conflict in provision with the view here express this power confer upon the president by the constitution have on occasion during administration of the executive department of the government deem duty to exercise and on this last occasion of make to congress an annual communication of the state of the union be not deem inappropriate to review the principle and consideration which have govern action deem this the more necessary because after the lapse of nearly|sixty|years since the adoption of the constitution the propriety of the exercise of this undoubted constitutional power by the president have for the first time be draw seriously in question by a portion of fellow citizen the constitution provide every bill which shall have pass the|house|of|representatives and the senate shall before become a law be present to the president of the|united|state if approve shall sign but if not shall return with objection to that house in which shall have originate who shall enter the objection at large on journal and proceed to reconsider the preservation of the constitution from infraction be the president 's high duty be bind to discharge that duty at whatever hazard of incur the displeasure of those who may differ with in opinion be bind to discharge as well by obligation to the people who have clothe with exalt trust as by oath of office which may not disregard nor be the obligation of the president in any degree lessen by the prevalence of view different from own in or both houses|of|congress be not alone hasty and inconsiderate legislation that be require to check but if at any time congress shall after apparently full deliberation resolve on measure which deem subversive of the constitution or of the vital interest of the country be solemn duty to stand in the breach and resist the president be bind to approve or disapprove every bill which pass congress and be present to for signature the constitution make this duty and can not escape if would have no election in decide upon any bill present to must exercise own good judgment if can not approve the constitution command to return the bill to the house in which originate with objection and if fail to do this within ten|day sunday except shall become a law without signature right or wrong may be overrule by a vote of third of each house and in that event the bill become a law without sanction if objection be not thus overrule the subject be only postpone and be refer to the states and the people for consideration and decision the president 's power be negative merely and not affirmative can enact no law the only effect therefore of withhold approval of a bill pass by congress be to suffer the exist law to remain unchanged and the delay occasion be only that require to enable the states and the people to consider and act upon the subject in the election of public agent who will carry out wish and instruction any attempt to coerce the president to yield sanction to measure which can not approve would be a violation of the spirit of the constitution palpable and flagrant and if successful would break down the independence of the executive department and make the president elect by the people and clothe by the constitution with power to defend right the mere instrument of a majority of congress a surrender on part of the power with which the constitution have invest office would effect a practical alteration of that instrument without resort to the prescribed process of amendment with the motif or consideration which may induce congress to pass any bill the president can have nothing to do must presume to be as pure as own and look only to the practical effect of measure when compare with the constitution or the public good but have be urge by those who object to the exercise of this undoubted constitutional power that assail the representative principle and the capacity of the people to govern that there be great safety in a numerous representative body than in the single executive create by the constitution and that the executive veto be a man power despotic in character to expose the fallacy of this objection be only necessary to consider the frame and true character of system be not a consolidated empire but a confederate union the states before the adoption of the constitution be coordinate co - equal and separate independent sovereignty and by adoption do not lose that character clothe the|federal|government with certain power and reserve all other include own sovereignty to guard own right as states and the right of the people by the very limitation which incorporate into the|federal|constitution whereby the different department of the|general|government be check upon each other that the majority should govern be a general principle controvert by none but must govern accord to the constitution and not accord to an undefined and unrestrained discretion whereby may oppress the minority the people of the|united|state be not blind to the fact that may be temporarily mislead and that representative legislative and executive may be mistake or influence in action by improper motif have therefore interpose between and the law which may be pass by public agent various representation such as assembly senate and governor in several states a|house|of|representative a senate and a president of the|united|state the people can by own direct agency make no law nor can the|house|of|representatives immediately elect by nor can the senate nor can both together without the concurrence of the president or a vote of third of both house happily for the people in frame admirable system of government be conscious of the infirmity of representative and in delegate to the power of legislation have fence around with check to guard against the effect of hasty action of error of combination and of possible corruption error selfishness and faction have often seek to rend asunder this web of check and subject the government to the control of fanatic and sinister influence but these effort have only satisfy the people of the wisdom of the check which have impose and of the necessity of preserve unimpaired the true theory of system be not to govern by the act or decree of any set of representative the constitution interpose check upon all branch of the government in order to give time for error to be correct and delusion to pass away but if the people settle down into a firm conviction different from that of representative give effect to opinion by change public servant the check which the people impose on public servant in the adoption of the constitution be the good evidence of capacity for self government know that the man whom elect to public station be of like infirmity and passion with and not to be trust without be restrict by coordinate authority and constitutional limitation who that have witness the legislation of congress for the|last|thirty|years will say that know of no instance in which measure not demand by the public good have be carry who will deny that in the state government by combination of individual and section in derogation of the general interest bank have be charter system of internal improvement adopt and debt entail upon the people repress growth and impair energy for year to come after so much experience can not be say that absolute unchecked power be safe in the hand of any set of representative or that the capacity of the people for self government which be admit in broad extent be a conclusive argument to prove the prudence wisdom and integrity of representative the people by the constitution have command the president as much as have command the legislative branch of the government to execute will have say to in the constitution which require shall take a solemn oath to support that if congress pass any bill which can not approve shall return to the house in which originate with objection in withholding from approval and signature be execute the will of the people constitutionally express as much as the congress that pass no bill be presume to be in accordance with the popular will until shall have pass through all the branch of the government require by the constitution to make a law a bill which pass the|house|of|representatives may be reject by the senate and so a bill pass by the senate may be reject by the house in each case the respective houses exercise the veto power on the other congress and each house|of|congress hold under the constitution a check upon the president and by the power of the qualified veto a check upon congress when the president recommend measure to congress avow in the most solemn form opinion give voice in favor and pledge in advance to approve if pass by congress if act without due consideration or have be influence by improper or corrupt motif or if from any other cause congress or either house|of|congress shall differ with in opinion exercise veto upon recommendation and reject and there be no appeal from decision but to the people at the ballot box these be proper check upon the executive wisely interpose by the constitution none will be find to object to or to wish remove be equally important that the constitutional check of the executive upon the legislative branch should be preserve if be say that the representatives in the popular branch of congress be choose directly by the people be answer the people elect the president if both houses represent the states and the people so do the president the president represent in the executive department the whole people of the|united|state as each member of the legislative department represent portion of the doctrine of restriction upon legislative and executive power while a well settle public opinion be enable within a reasonable time to accomplish end have make country what be and have open to a career of glory and happiness to which all other nation have be stranger in the exercise of the power of the veto the president be responsible not only to an enlighten public opinion but to the people of the whole union who elect as the representative in the legislative branch who differ with in opinion be responsible to the people of particular states or district who compose respective constituency to deny to the president the exercise of this power would be to repeal that provision of the constitution which confer upon to charge that exercise unduly control the legislative will be to complain of the constitution if the presidential veto be object to upon the ground that check and thwart the popular will upon the same principle the equality of representation of the states in the senate should be stricken out of the constitution the vote of a senator from delaware have equal weight in decide upon the most important measure with the vote of a senator from new|york and yet the one represent a state contain accord to the exist apportionment of representatives in the|house|of|representatives but fourth part of the population of the other by the constitutional composition of the senate a majority of that body from the small state represent fourth of the people of the union there be states and under the exist apportionment of representatives there be member in the|house|of|representatives of the small state be represent in that house by but member and yet the senators from these states constitute a majority of the senate so that the president may recommend a measure to congress and may receive the sanction and approval of more|than|three fourth of the|house|of|representatives and of all the senators from the large states contain more|than|three fourth of the whole population of the|united|state and yet the measure may be defeat by the vote of the senators from the small states none be presume can be find ready to change the organization of the senate on this account or to strike that body practically out of existence by require that action shall be conform to the will of the more numerous branch upon the same principle that the veto of the president should be practically abolish the power of the vice president to give the cast vote upon an equal division of the senate should be abolish also the vice president exercise the veto power as effectually by reject a bill by cast vote as the president do by refuse to approve and sign this power have be exercise by the vice president in a few instance the most important of which be the rejection of the bill to recharter the|bank|of|the|united|state in may happen that a bill may be pass by a large majority of the|house|of|representatives and may be support by the senators from the large states and the vice president may reject by give vote with the senators from the small states and yet none be presume be prepared to deny to the exercise of this power under the constitution but be in point of fact untrue that an act pass by congress be conclusive evidence that be an emanation of the popular will a majority of the whole number elect to each house of congress constitute a quorum and a majority of that quorum be competent to pass law may happen that a quorum of the|house|of|representatives consist of a single member more|than|half of the whole number elect to that house may pass a bill by a majority of a single vote and in that case a fraction more than fourth of the people of the|united|state would be represent by those who vote for may happen that the same bill may be pass by a majority of of a quorum of the senate compose of senators from the small states and a single senator from a sixteenth state and if the senators vote for happen to be from the of the small of these states would be pass by the vote of senators from states have but representatives in the|house|of|representatives and contain less than sixteenth of the whole population of the|united|state this extreme case be state to illustrate the fact that the mere passage of a bill by congress be no conclusive evidence that those who pass represent the majority of the people of the|united|state or truly reflect will if such an extreme case be not likely to happen case that approximate be of constant occurrence be believe that not a single law have be pass since the adoption of the constitution upon which all the member elect to both houses have be present and vote many of the most important act which have pass congress have be carry by a close vote in thin houses many instance of this may be give indeed experience prove that many of the most important act of congress be postpone to the|last|days and often the|last|hours of a session when be dispose of in haste and by house but little exceed the number necessary to form a quorum besides in most of the states the member of the|house|of|representatives be choose by plurality and not by majority of all the voter in respective district and may happen that a majority of that house may be return by a less aggregate vote of the people than that receive by the minority if the principle insist on be sound then the constitution should be so change that no bill shall become a law unless be vote for by member represent in each house a majority of the whole people of the|united|state must remodel whole system strike down and abolish not only the salutary check lodge in the executive branch but must strike out and abolish those lodge in the senate also and thus practically invest the whole power of the government in a majority of a single assembly a majority uncontrolled and absolute and which may become despotic to conform to this doctrine of the right of majority to rule independent of the check and limitation of the constitution must revolutionize whole system must destroy the constitutional compact by which the several states agree to form a federal|union and rush into consolidation which must end in monarchy or despotism no one advocate such a proposition and yet the doctrine maintain if carry out must lead to this result great object of the constitution in confer upon the president a qualified negative upon the legislation of congress be to protect minority from injustice and oppression by majority the equality of representation in the senate and the veto power of the president be the constitutional guaranty which the small state have that right will be respect without these guaranty all interest would be at the mercy of majority in congress represent the large states to the small and weak states therefore the preservation of this power and exercise upon proper occasion demand be of vital importance ratify the constitution and enter into the union secure to an equal representation with the large states in the senate and agree to be bind by all law pass by congress upon the express condition and none other that should be approve by the president or pass objection to the contrary notwithstanding by a vote of third of both houses upon this condition have a right to insist as a part of the compact to which give assent a bill may be pass by congress against the will of the whole people of a particular state and against the vote of senator and all representatives however prejudicial may be to the interest of such state would be bind by if the president shall approve or shall be pass by a vote of third of both houses but have a right to demand that the president shall exercise constitutional power and arrest if judgment be against if surrender this power or fail to exercise in a case where can not approve would make formal approval a mere mockery and would be a violation of the constitution and the dissent state would become bind by a law which have not be pass accord to the sanction of the constitution the objection to the exercise of the veto power be found upon an idea respect the popular will which if carry out would annihilate state sovereignty and substitute for the present federal|government a consolidation direct by a suppose numerical majority a revolution of the government would be silently effect and the states would be subject to law to which have never give constitutional consent the|supreme|court of the|united|state be invest with the power to declare and have declare act of congress pass with the concurrence of the senate the|house|of|representatives and the approval of the president to be unconstitutional and void and yet none be presume can be find who will be dispose to strip this high judicial tribunal under the constitution of this acknowledge power a power necessary alike to independence and the right of individual for the same reason that the executive veto should accord to the doctrine maintain be render nugatory and be practically expunge from the constitution this power of the court should also be render nugatory and be expunge because restrain the legislative and executive will and because the exercise of such a power by the court may be regard as be in conflict with the capacity of the people to govern indeed there be more reason for strike this power of the court from the constitution than there be that of the qualified veto of the president because the decision of the court be final and can never be reverse even though both houses|of|congress and the president should be unanimous in opposition to whereas the veto of the president may be overrule by a vote of third of both houses of congress or by the people at the poll be obvious that to preserve the system establish by the constitution each of the coordinate branch of the government the executive legislative and judicial must be leave in the exercise of appropriate power if the executive or the judicial branch be deprive of power confer upon either as check on the legislative the preponderance of the latter will become disproportionate and absorb and the other impotent for the accomplishment of the great object for which be establish organize as be by the constitution work together harmoniously for the public good if the executive and the judiciary shall be deprive of the constitutional power invest in and of due proportion the equilibrium of the system must be destroy and consolidation with the most pernicious result must ensue a consolidation of unchecked despotic power exercise by majority of the legislative branch the executive legislative and judicial each constitute a separate coordinate department of the government and each be independent of the other in the performance of respective duty under the constitution neither can in legitimate action control the other each act upon several responsibility in respective sphere but if the doctrine now maintain be correct the executive must become practically subordinate to the legislative and the judiciary must become subordinate to both the legislative and the executive and thus the whole power of the government would be merge in a single department whenever if ever this shall occur glorious system of well regulate self government will crumble into ruin to be succeed first by anarchy and finally by monarchy or despotism be far from believe that this doctrine be the sentiment of the american people and during the short period which remain in which will be duty to administer the executive department will be aim to maintain independence and discharge duty without infringe upon the power or duty of either of the other department of the government the power of the executive veto be exercise by the first and most illustrious of predecessor and by of successor who precede in the administration of the government and be believe in no instance prejudicially to the public interest have never be and there be but little danger that ever can be abuse no president will ever desire unnecessarily to place opinion in opposition to that of congress must always exercise the power reluctantly and only in case where conviction make a matter of stern duty which can not escape indeed there be more danger that the president from the repugnance must always feel to come in collision with congress may fail to exercise in case where the preservation of the constitution from infraction or the public good may demand than that will ever exercise unnecessarily or wantonly during the period have administer the executive department of the government great and important question of public policy foreign and domestic have arise upon which be duty to act may indeed be truly say that administration have fall upon eventful time have feel most sensibly the weight of the high responsibility devolve upon with no other object than the public good the endure fame and permanent prosperity of country have pursue the conviction of own good judgment the impartial arbitrament of enlighten public opinion present and future will determine how far the public policy have maintain and the measure have from time to time recommend may have tend to advance or retard the public prosperity at home and to elevate or depress the estimate of national character abroad invoke the blessing of the almighty upon deliberation at present important session ardent hope be that in a spirit of harmony and concord may be guide to wise result and such as may redound to the happiness the honor and the glory of beloved country transcript to the|house|of|representatives of the|united|state when the president have give official sanction to a bill which have pass congress usage require that shall notify the house in which originate of that fact the mode of give this notification have be by an oral message deliver by private secretary have this|day approve and sign an act entitle an act to establish the territorial government of oregon deem proper under the exist circumstance to communicate the fact in a more solemn form the deeply interesting and protract discussion which have take place in both houses|of|congress and the absorb interest which the subject have excite throughout the country justify in judgment this departure from the form of notice observe in other case in this communication with a coordinate branch of the government make proper by the consideration refer to shall frankly and without reserve express the reason which have constrain not to withhold signature from the bill to establish a government over oregon even though the territory of new|mexico and california be to be leave for the present without government none doubt that be proper to establish a government in oregon indeed have be too long delay have make repeat recommendation to congress to this effect the petition of the people of that distant region have be present to the government and ought not to be disregard to give to a regularly organize government and the protection of law which as citizen of the|united|state claim be a high duty on part and one which be bind to perform unless there be control reason to prevent in the progress of all government question of such transcendent importance occasionally arise as to cast in the shade all those of a mere party character but such question can now be agitate in this country and this may endanger glorious union the source of greatness and all political blessing this question be slavery with the slaveholde states this do not embrace merely the right of property however valuable but ascend far higher and involve the domestic peace and security of every family the father of the constitution the wise and patriotic man who lay the foundation of institution foresee the danger from this|quarter act in a spirit of compromise and mutual concession on this dangerous and delicate subject and wisdom ought to be the guide of successor whilst leave to the states exclusively the question of domestic slavery within respective limit provide that slave who may escape into other states not recognize the institution of slavery shall be deliver up on the claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due upon this foundation the matter rest until the missouri question arise in december,|1819 application be make to congress by the people of the|missouri|territory for admission into the union as a state the discussion upon the subject in congress involve the question of slavery and be prosecute with such violence as to produce excitement alarm to every patriot in the union but the good genius of conciliation which preside at the birth of institution finally prevail and the missouri compromise be adopt the eighth section of the act of congress of the|6th|of|march,|1820 to authorize the people of the|missouri|territory to form a constitution and state government provide that in all that territory cede by france to the|united|state under the name of louisiana which lie north of degree north latitude not include within the limit of the state contemplate by this act slavery and involuntary servitude otherwise than in the punishment of crime whereof the party shall have be duly convict shall be and be hereby forever prohibit provide always that any person escape into the same from whom labor or service be lawfully claim in any state or territory of the|united|state such fugitive may be lawfully reclaim and convey to the person claim or labor or service as aforesaid this compromise have the effect of calm the troubled wave and restore peace and good will throughout the|states|of|the|union the missouri question have excite intense agitation of the public mind and threaten to divide the country into

will exceed the cost of the war and all the expense to which have be subject in acquire the resolution also call for the evidence or any part thereof that the extensive and valuable territory cede by mexico to the united|states constitute indemnity for the past the immense value of the cede country do not consist alone in the amount of money for which the public land may be sell if not a dollar could be realize from the sale of these land the cession of the jurisdiction over the country and the fact that have become a part of union and can not be make subject to any european power constitute ample indemnity for the past in the immense value and advantage which acquisition must give to the commercial navigating manufacturing and agricultural interest of country the value of the public land embrace within the limit of the ceded territory great as that value may be be far less important to the people of the|united|state than the sovereignty over the country most of state contain no public land own by the|united|state and yet the sovereignty and jurisdiction over be of incalculable importance to the nation in the|state|of|new|york the|united|state be the owner of no public land and yet third of whole revenue be collect at the great port of that state and within limit be find about|one seventh of entire population although none of the future city on coast of california may ever rival the city of new|york in wealth population and business yet that important city will grow up on the magnificent harbor of that coast with a rapidly increase commerce and population and yield a large revenue would seem to be certain by the possession of the safe and capacious harbor on the californian coast shall have great advantage in secure the rich commerce of the east and shall thus obtain for product new and increased market and greatly enlarge coasting and foreign trade as well as augment tonnage and revenue these great advantage far more than the simple value of the public land in the ceded territory constitute indemnity for the past transcript whereas a treaty of peace friendship limit and settlement between the|united|states|of|america and the|mexican|republic be conclude and

the territory of the|state of texas strike the first blow and shed the blood of citizen on own soil though the|united|state be the aggrieve nation mexico commence the war and be compel in self defense to repel the invader and to vindicate the national honor and interest by prosecute with vigor until could obtain a just and honorable peace on learn that hostility have be commence by mexico promptly communicate that fact accompany with a succinct statement of other cause of complaint against mexico to congress and that body by the act of the|13th|of|may,|1846 declare that by the act of the|republic|of|mexico a state of war exist between that government and the|united|state this act declare the war to exist by the act of the|republic|of|mexico and make provision for prosecution to a speedy and successful termination be pass with great unanimity by congress there be but negative vote in the senate and but in the|house|of|representatives the existence of the war have thus be declare by congress become duty under the constitution and the law to conduct and prosecute this duty have be perform and though at every stage of progress have manifest a willingness to terminate by a just peace mexico have refuse to accede to any term which could be accept by the|united|state consistently with the national honor and interest the rapid and brilliant success of arm and the vast extent of the enemy 's territory which have be overrun and conquer before the close of the last session of congress be fully know to that body since that time the war have be prosecute with increase energy and be gratify to state with a success which command universal admiration history present no parallel of so many glorious victory achieve by any nation within so short a period army regular and volunteer have cover with imperishable honor whenever and wherever force have encounter the enemy though be in vastly superior number and often intrench in fortify position of own selection and of great strength have be defeat too much praise can not be bestow upon officer and man regular and volunteer for gallantry discipline indomitable courage and perseverance all seek the post of danger and vie with each other in deed of noble daring while every patriot 's heart must exult and a just national pride animate every bosom in behold the high proof of courage consummate military skill steady discipline and humanity to the vanquished enemy exhibit by gallant army the nation be call to mourn over the loss of many brave officer and soldier who have fall in defense of country 's honor and interest the brave dead meet melancholy fate in a foreign land nobly discharge duty and with country 's flag wave triumphantly in the face of the foe patriotic deed be justly appreciate and will long be remember by grateful countryman the parental care of the government love and serve should be extend to survive family shortly after the adjournment of the last session of congress the gratify intelligence be receive of the signal victory of buena|vista and of the fall of the city of vera|cruz and with the strong castle of san|juan|de|ulloa by which be defend believe that after these and other success so honorable to arm and so disastrous to mexico the period be propitious to afford another opportunity if think proper to embrace to enter into negotiation for peace a commissioner be appoint to proceed to the headquarters of army with full power to enter upon negotiation and to conclude a just and honorable treaty of peace be not direct to make any new overture of peace but be the bearer of a dispatch from the secretary of state of the|united|state to the minister of foreign affair of mexico in reply to receive from the latter of the|22d|of|february,|1847 in which the|mexican|government be inform of appointment and of presence at the headquarters of army and that be invest with full power to conclude a definitive treaty of peace whenever the|mexican|government may signify a desire to do so while be unwilling to subject the|united|state to another indignant refusal be yet resolve that the evil of the war should not be protract a day longer than may be render absolutely necessary by the|mexican|government care be take to give no instruction to the commissioner which could in any way interfere with military operation or relax energy in the prosecution of the war possess no authority in any manner to control these operation be authorize to exhibit instruction to the general in command of the army and in the event of a treaty be conclude and ratify on the part of mexico be direct to give notice of that fact on the happening of such contingency and on receive notice thereof the general in command be instruct by the secretary of war to suspend further active military operation until further order these instruction be give with a view to intermit hostility until the treaty thus ratify by mexico could be transmit to washington and receive the action of the|united|state the commissioner be also direct on reach the army to deliver to the general in command the dispatch which bear from the secretary of state to the minister of foreign affair of mexico and on receive the general be instruct by the secretary of war to cause to be transmit to the commander of the mexican force with a quest that may be communicate to government the commissioner do not reach the headquarters of the army until after another brilliant victory have crown arm at cerro|gordo the dispatch which bear from the secretary of war to the general in command of the army be receive by that officer then at jalapa on the 7th of may,|1847 together with the dispatch from the secretary of state to the minister of foreign affair of mexico have be transmit to from vera|cruz the commissioner arrive at the headquarters of the army a|few|days|afterwards presence with the army and diplomatic character be make known to the|mexican|government from puebla on the|12th|of|june,|1847 by the transmission of the dispatch from the secretary of state to the minister of foreign affair of mexico many|week elapse after receipt and no overture be make nor be any desire express by the|mexican|government to enter into negotiation for peace army pursue march upon the capital and as approach be meet by formidable resistance force first encounter the enemy and achieve signal victory in the severely contest battle of contreras and churubusco be not until after these action have result in decisive victory and the capital of the enemy be within power that the|mexican|government manifest any disposition to enter into negotiation for peace and even then as event have prove there be too much reason to believe be insincere and that in agree to go through the form of negotiation the object be to gain time to strengthen the defense of capital and to prepare for fresh resistance the general in command of the army deem expedient to suspend hostility temporarily by enter into an armistice with a view to the opening of negotiation commissioner be appoint on the part of mexico to meet the commissioner on the part of the|united|state the result of the conference which take place between these functionary of the government be a failure to conclude a treaty of peace the commissioner of the|united|state take with the project of a treaty already prepare by the term of which the indemnity require by the|united|state be a cession of territory be well know that the only indemnity which be in the power of mexico to make in satisfaction of the just and long defer claim of citizen against and the only mean by which can reimburse the|united|state for the expense of the war be a cession to the|united|state of a portion of territory mexico have no money to pay and no other mean of make the require indemnity if refuse this can obtain nothing else to reject indemnity by refuse to accept a cession of territory would be to abandon all just demand and to wage the war bear all expense without a purpose or definite object a state of war abrogate treaty previously exist between the belligerent and a treaty of peace put an end to all claim for indemnity for tortious act commit under the authority of government against the citizen or subject of another unless be provide for in stipulation a treaty of peace which would terminate the exist war without provide for indemnity would enable mexico the acknowledge debtor and the aggressor in the war to relieve from just liability by such a treaty citizen who hold just demand against would have no remedy either against mexico or own government duty to these citizen must forever prevent such a peace and no treaty which do not provide ample mean of discharge these demand can receive sanction a treaty of peace should settle all exist difference between the country if an adequate cession of territory should be make by such a treaty the|united|states should release mexico from all liability and assume payment to own citizen if instead of this the|united|state be to consent to a treaty by which mexico should again engage to pay the heavy amount of indebtedness which a just indemnity to government and citizen would impose on be notorious that do not possess the mean to meet such an undertaking from such a treaty no result could be anticipate but the same irritating disappointment which have heretofore attend the violation of similar treaty stipulation on the part of mexico such a treaty would be but a temporary cessation of hostility without the restoration of the friendship and good understanding which should characterize the future intercourse between the country that congress contemplate the acquisition of territorial indemnity when that body make provision for the prosecution of the war be obvious congress could not have mean when in may,|1846 appropriate and authorize the president to employ the militia and naval and military force of the|united|state and to accept the service of volunteer to enable to prosecute the war and when at last session and after army have invade mexico make additional appropriation and authorize the raising of additional troop for the same purpose that no indemnity be to be obtain from mexico at the conclusion of the war and yet be certain that if no mexican territory be acquire no indemnity could be obtain be further manifest that congress contemplate territorial indemnity from the fact that at last session an act be pass upon the executive recommendation appropriate with that express object this appropriation be make to enable the president to conclude a treaty of peace limit and boundary with the|republic|of|mexico to be use by in the event that say treaty when sign by the authorize agent of the governments and duly ratify by mexico shall call for the expenditure of the same or any part thereof the object of ask this appropriation be distinctly state in the several message on the subject which communicate to congress similar appropriation make in and which be refer to be intend to be apply in part consideration for the cession of louisiana and the floridas in like manner be anticipate that in settle the term of a treaty of limit and boundary with mexico a cession of territory estimate to be of great value than the amount of demand against may be obtain and that the prompt payment of this sum in part consideration for the territory cede on the conclusion of a treaty and ratification on part may be an inducement with to make such a cession of territory as would be satisfactory to the|united|state and although the failure to conclude such a treaty have render unnecessary to use any part of the appropriate by that act and the entire sum remain in the treasury be still applicable to that object should the contingency occur make such application proper the doctrine of no territory be the doctrine of no indemnity and if sanction would be a public acknowledgment that country be wrong and that the war declare by congress with extraordinary unanimity be unjust and should be abandon an admission unfounded in fact and degrade to the national character the term of the treaty propose by the|united|state be not only just to mexico but consider the character and amount of claim the unjustifiable and unprovoked commencement of hostility by the expense of the war to which have be subject and the success which have attend arm be deem to be of a most liberal character the commissioner of the|united|state be authorize to agree to the establishment of the|rio|grande as the boundary from entrance into the gulf to intersection with the southern boundary of new|mexico in north latitude about degree and to obtain a cession to the|united|state of the|provinces|of|new|mexico and the californias and the privilege of the right of way across the|isthmus|of|tehuantepec the boundary of the|rio|grande and the cession to the|united|state of new|mexico and upper|california constitute an ultimatum which commissioner be under no circumstance to yield that may be manifest not only to mexico but to all other nation that the|united|states be not dispose to take advantage of a feeble power by insist upon wrestle from all the other provinces include many of principal town and city which have conquer and hold in military occupation but be willing to conclude a treaty in a spirit of liberality commissioner be authorize to stipulate for the restoration to mexico of all other conquest as the territory to be acquire by the boundary propose may be estimate to be of great value than a fair equivalent for just demand commissioner be authorize to stipulate for the payment of such additional pecuniary consideration as be deem reasonable the term of a treaty propose by the mexican commissioner be wholly inadmissible negotiate as if mexico be the victorious and not the vanquished party must have know that ultimatum could never be accept require the|united|state to dismember texas by surrender to mexico that part of the territory of that state lie between the nueces and the|rio|grande include within limit by law when be an independent republic and when be annex to the|united|states and admit by congress as of the states of union contain no provision for the payment by mexico of the just claim of citizen require indemnity to mexican citizen for injury may have sustain by troop in the prosecution of the war demand the right for mexico to levy and collect the mexican tariff of duty on good import into port while in military occupation during the war and the owner of which have pay to officer of the|united|state the military contribution which have be levy upon and offer to cede to the|united|state for a pecuniary consideration that part of upper|california lie north of latitude ° such be the unreasonable term propose by the mexican commissioner the cession to the|united|state by mexico of the|provinces|of|new|mexico and the californias as propose by the commissioner of the|united|state be believe would be more in accordance with the convenience and interest of both nation than any other cession of territory which be probable mexico could be induce to make be manifest to all who have observe the actual condition of the|mexican|government for some|years|past and at present that if these provinces should be retain by could not long continue to hold and govern mexico be too feeble a power to govern these provinces lie as do at a distance of more|than|1,000|mile from capital and if attempt to be retain by would constitute but for a short time even nominally a part of dominion this would be especially the case with upper|california the sagacity of powerful european nation have long since direct attention to the commercial importance of that province and there can be little doubt that the moment shall relinquish present occupation of and claim to as indemnity an effort would be make by some foreign power to possess either by conquest or by purchase if no foreign government should acquire in either of these mode an independent revolutionary government would probably be establish by the inhabitant and such foreigner as may remain in or remove to the country as soon as shall be know that the|united|state have abandon such a government would be too feeble long to maintain separate independent existence and would finally become annexed to or be a dependent colony of some more powerful state should any foreign government attempt to possess as a colony or otherwise to incorporate with the principle avow by president monroe in and reaffirm in first annual message that no foreign power shall with consent be permit to plant or establish any new colony or dominion on any part of the north|american continent must be maintain in maintain this principle and in resist invasion by any foreign power may be involve in other war more expensive and more difficult than that in which be now engage the|provinces|of|new|mexico|and|the|california be contiguous to the territory of the|united|state and if bring under the government of law resource mineral agricultural manufacturing and commercial would soon be develop upper california be bound on the north by oregon possession and if hold by the|united|state would soon be settle by a hardy enterprising and intelligent portion of population the|bay|of|san|francisco and other harbor along the californian coast would afford shelter for navy for numerous whale ship and other merchant vessel employ in and would in a short period become the mart of an extensive and profitable commerce with china and other country of the east these advantage in which the whole commercial world would participate would at once be secure to the|united|state by the cession of this territory while be certain that as long as remain a part of the mexican dominion can be enjoy neither by mexico nor by any other nation new|mexico be a frontier province and have never be of any considerable value to mexico from locality be naturally connect with western settlement the territorial limit of the|state of texas too as define by law before admission into union embrace all that portion of new|mexico lie east of the|rio|grande while mexico still claim to hold this territory as a part of dominion the adjustment of this question of boundary be important there be another consideration which induce the belief that the|mexican|government may even desire to place this province under the protection of the|government|of|the|united|state numerous band of fierce and warlike savage wander over and upon border mexico have be and must continue to be too feeble to restrain from commit depredation robbery and murder not only upon the inhabitant of new|mexico but upon those of the other northern states of mexico would be a blessing to all these northern states to have citizen protect against by the power of the|united|state at this moment many mexicans principally female and child be in captivity among if new|mexico be hold and govern by the|united|state could effectually prevent these tribe from commit such outrage and compel to release these captive and restore to family and friend in propose to acquire new|mexico and the californias be know that but an inconsiderable portion of the mexican people would be transfer with the country embrace within these province be chiefly an uninhabited region these be the lead consideration which induce to authorize the term of peace which be propose to mexico be reject and negotiation be at an end hostility be renew an assault be make by gallant army upon the strongly fortify place near the gate of the|city|of|mexico and upon the city and after several|day of severe conflict the mexican force vastly superior in number to own be drive from the city and be occupy by troop immediately after information be receive of the unfavorable result of the negotiation believe that continue presence with the army could be productive of no good determine to recall commissioner a dispatch to this effect be transmit to on the 6th of october last the|mexican|government will be inform of recall and that in the exist state of thing shall not deem proper to make any further overture of peace but shall be at all time ready to receive and consider any proposal which may be make by mexico since the liberal proposition of the|united|state be authorize to be make in april last large expenditure have be incur and the precious blood of many of patriotic fellow citizen have be shed in the prosecution of the war this consideration and the obstinate perseverance of mexico in protract the war must influence the term of peace which may be deem proper hereafter to accept arm have be everywhere victorious have subject to military occupation a large portion of the enemy 's country include capital and negotiation for peace have fail the important question arise in what manner the war ought to be prosecute and what should be future policy can not doubt that should secure and render available the conquest which have already make and that with this view should hold and occupy by naval and military force all the port town city and provinces now in occupation or which may hereafter fall into possession that should press forward military operation and levy such military contribution on the enemy as may as far as practicable defray the future expense of the war have the government of mexico accede to the equitable and liberal term propose that mode of adjustment would have be prefer mexico have decline to do this and fail to offer any other term which could be accept by the|united|state the national honor no less than the public interest require that the war should be prosecute with increase energy and power until a just and satisfactory peace can be obtain in the meantime as mexico refuse all indemnity should adopt measure to indemnify by appropriate permanently a portion of territory early after the commencement of the war new|mexico and the californias be take possession of by force military and naval commander be order to conquer and hold subject to be dispose of by a treaty of peace these province be now in undisputed occupation and have be so for many|month all resistance on the part of mexico have cease within limit be satisfied that should never be surrender to mexico should congress concur with in this opinion and that should be retain by the|united|state as indemnity can perceive no good reason why the civil jurisdiction and law of the|united|state should not at once be extend over to wait for a treaty of peace such as be willing to make by which relation toward would not be change can not be good policy whilst own interest and that of the people inhabit require that a stable responsible and free government under authority should as soon as possible be establish over should congress therefore determine to hold these province permanently and that shall hereafter be consider as constituent part of country the early establishment of territorial government over will be important for the more perfect protection of person and property and recommend that such territorial government be establish will promote peace and tranquillity among the inhabitant by allay all apprehension that may still entertain of be again subject to the jurisdiction of mexico invite the early and favorable consideration of congress to this important subject besides new|mexico and the californias there be other mexican provinces which have be reduce to possession by conquest these other mexican|provinces be now govern by military and naval commander under the general authority which be confer upon a conqueror by the law of war should continue to be hold as a means of coerce mexico to accede to just term of peace civil as well as military officer be require to conduct such a government adequate compensation to be draw from contribution levy on the enemy should be fix by law for such officer as may be thus employ what further provision may become necessary and what final disposition may be proper to make of must depend on the future progress of the war and the course which mexico may think proper hereafter to pursue with the view entertain can not favor the policy which have be suggest either to withdraw army altogether or to retire to a designate line and simply hold and defend to withdraw army altogether from the conquest have make by deed of unparalleled bravery and at the expense of so much blood and treasure in a just war on part and one which by the act of the enemy could not honorably have avoid would be to degrade the nation in own estimation and in that of the world to retire to a line and simply hold and defend would not terminate the war on the contrary would encourage mexico to persevere and tend to protract indefinitely be not to be expect that mexico after refuse to establish such a line as a permanent boundary when victorious army be in possession of capital and in the heart of country would permit to hold without resistance that would continue the war and in the most harassing and annoying form there can be no doubt a border warfare of the most savage character extend over a long line would be unceasingly wag would require a large army to be keep constantly in the field station at post and garrison along such a line to protect and defend the enemy relieve from the pressure of arm on coast and in the populous part of the interior would direct attention to this line and select an isolate post for attack would concentrate force upon this would be a condition of affair which the mexicans pursue favorite system of guerrilla warfare would probably prefer to any other be to assume a defensive attitude on such a line all the advantage of such a state of war would be on the side of the enemy could levy no contribution upon or in any other way make feel the pressure of the war but must remain inactive and await approach be in constant uncertainty at what point on the line or at what time may make an assault may assemble and organize an overwhelming force in the interior on own side of the line and conceal purpose make a sudden assault upon some of post so distant from any other as to prevent the possibility of timely succor or reenforcement and in this way gallant army would be expose to the danger of be cut off in detail or if by unequaled bravery and prowess everywhere exhibit during this war should repulse the enemy number station at any post may be too small to pursue if the enemy be repulse in attack would have nothing to do but to retreat to own side of the line and be in no fear of a pursue army may reenforce at leisure for another attack on the same or some other post may too cross the line between post make rapid incursion into the country which hold murder the inhabitant commit depredation on and then retreat to the interior before a sufficient force can be concentrate to pursue such would probably be the harass character of a mere defensive war on part if force when attack or threaten with attack be permit to cross the line drive back the enemy and conquer this would be again to invade the enemy 's country after have lose all the advantage of the conquest have already make by have voluntarily abandon to hold such a line successfully and in security be far from be certain that would not require as large an army as would be necessary to hold all the conquest have already make and to continue the prosecution of the war in the heart of the enemy 's country be also far from be certain that the expense of the war would be diminish by such a policy be persuade that the good mean of vindicate the national honor and interest and of bring the war to an honorable close will be to prosecute with increase energy and power in the vital part of the enemy 's country in annual message to congress of december last declare the war have not be wag with a view to conquest but have be commence by mexico have be carry into the enemy 's country and will be vigorously prosecute there with a view to obtain an honorable peace and thereby secure ample indemnity for the expense of the war as well as to much injure citizen who hold large pecuniary demand against mexico such in judgment continue to be true policy indeed the only policy which will probably secure a permanent peace have never be contemplate by as an object of the war to make a permanent conquest of the|republic|of|mexico or to annihilate separate existence as an independent nation on the contrary have ever be desire that should maintain nationality and under a good government adapt to condition be a free independent and prosperous republic the|united|state be the first among the nation to recognize independence and have always desire to be on term of amity and good neighborhood with this would not suffer by own conduct have be compel to engage in the present war in prosecution seek not overthrow as a nation but in vindicate national honor seek to obtain redress for the wrong have do and indemnity for just demand against demand an honorable peace and that peace must bring with indemnity for the past and security for the future hitherto|mexico have refuse all accommodation by which such a peace could be obtain whilst army have advance from victory to victory from the commencement of the war have always be with the olive branch of peace in hand and have be in the power of mexico at every step to arrest hostility by accept great obstacle to the attainment of peace have undoubtedly arise from the fact that mexico have be so long hold in subjection by faction or military usurper after another and such have be the condition of insecurity in which successive government have be place that each have be deter from make peace lest for this very cause a rival faction may expel from power such be the fate of president herrera 's administration in for be dispose even to listen to the overture of the|united|state to prevent the war as be fully confirm by an official correspondence which take place in the|month|of|august last between and government a copy of which be herewith communicate for this cause alone the revolution which displace from power be set on foot by general|parede such may be the condition of insecurity of the present government there can be no doubt that the peaceable and well dispose inhabitant of mexico be convince that be the true interest of country to conclude an honorable peace with the|united|state but the apprehension of become the victim of some military faction or usurper may have prevent from manifest feeling by any public act the removal of any such apprehension would probably cause to speak sentiment freely and to adopt the measure necessary for the restoration of peace with a people distract and divide by contend faction and a government subject to constant change by successive revolution the continue success of arm may fail to secure a satisfactory peace in such event may become proper for command general in the field to give encouragement and assurance of protection to the friend of peace in mexico in the establishment and maintenance of a free republican government of own choice able and willing to conclude a peace which would be just to and secure to the indemnity demand this may become the only mode of obtain such a peace should such be the result the war which mexico have force upon would thus be convert into an enduring blessing to after find torn and distract by faction and rule by military usurper should then leave with a republican government in the enjoyment of real independence and domestic peace and prosperity perform all relative duty in the great family of nation and promote own happiness by wise law and faithful execution if after afford this encouragement and protection and after all the persevering and sincere effort have make from the moment mexico commence the war and prior to that time to adjust difference with shall ultimately fail then shall have exhaust all honorable mean in pursuit of peace and must continue to occupy country with troop take the full measure of indemnity into own hand and must enforce the term which honor demand to act otherwise in the exist state of thing in mexico and to withdraw army without a peace would not only leave all the wrong of which complain unredressed but would be the signal for new and fierce civil dissension and new revolution all alike hostile to peaceful relation with the|united|state besides there be danger if troop be withdraw before a peace be conduct that the mexican people weary with successive revolution and deprive of protection for person and property may at length be incline to yield to foreign influence and to cast into the arm of some european monarch for protection from the anarchy and suffering which would ensue this for own safety and in pursuance of establish policy should be compel to resist could never consent that mexico should be thus convert into a monarchy govern by a foreign prince mexico be near neighbor and boundary be coterminous with own through the whole extent across the north|american continent from ocean to ocean both politically and commercially have the deep interest in regeneration and prosperity indeed be impossible that with any just regard to own safety can ever become indifferent to fate may be that the|mexican|government and people have misconstrue or misunderstood forbearance and object in desire to conclude an amicable adjustment of the exist difference between the country may have suppose that would submit to term degrade to the nation or may have draw false inference from the suppose division of opinion in the|united|state on the subject of the war and may have calculate to gain much by protract and indeed that may ultimately abandon altogether without insist on any indemnity territorial or otherwise whatever may be the false impression under which have act the adoption and prosecution of the energetic policy propose must soon undeceive in the future prosecution of the war the enemy must be make to feel pressure more than have heretofore do at commencement be deem proper to conduct in a spirit of forbearance and liberality with this end in view early measure be adopt to conciliate as far as a state of war would permit the mass of the mexican population to convince that the war be wag not against the peaceful inhabitant of mexico but against faithless government which have commence hostility to remove from mind the false impression which designing and interested ruler have artfully attempt to make that the war on part be of conquest that be a war against religion and church which be to be desecrate and overthrow and that right of person and private property would be violate to remove these false impression commander in the field be direct scrupulously to respect religion church and church property which be in no manner to be violate be direct also to respect the right of person and property of all who should not take up arm against assurance to this effect be give to the mexican people by major general taylor in a proclamation issue in pursuance of instruction from the secretary of war in the|month|of|june,|1846 and again by major general scott who act upon own conviction of the propriety of issue in a proclamation of the 11th of may,|1847 in this spirit of liberality and conciliation and with a view to prevent the body of the mexican population from take up arm against be the war conduct on part provision and other supply furnish to army by mexican citizen be pay for at fair and liberal price agree upon by the party after the lapse of a|few|month become apparent that these assurance and this mild treatment have fail to produce the desire effect upon the mexican population while the war have be conduct on part accord to the most humane and liberal principle observe by civilized nation be wag in a far different spirit on the part of mexico not appreciate forbearance the mexican people generally become hostile to the|united|state and avail of every opportunity to commit the most savage excess upon troop large number of the population take up arm and engage in guerrilla warfare rob and murder in the most cruel manner individual soldier or small party whom accident or other cause have separate from the main body of army band of guerrillero and robber infest the road harass train and whenever be in power cut off supply the mexicans have thus show to be wholly incapable of appreciate forbearance and liberality be deem proper to change the manner of conduct the war by make feel pressure accord to the usage observe under similar circumstance by all other civilized nation accordingly as early as the 22d of september instruction be give by the secretary of war to major general taylor to draw supply for army from the enemy without pay for and to require contribution for support if in that way be satisfied could get abundant supply for force in direct the execution of these instruction much be necessarily leave to the discretion of the command officer who be best acquaint with the circumstance by which be surround the want of the army and the practicability of enforce the measure general taylor on the|26th|of|october,|1846 reply from monterey that would have be impossible hitherto and be so now to sustain the army to any extent by force contribution of money or supply for the reason assign by do not adopt the policy of instruction but declare readiness to do so should the army in future operation reach a portion of the country which may be make to supply the troop with advantage continue to pay for the article of supply which be draw from the enemy 's country similar instruction be issue to major general scott on the of april,|1847 who reply from jalapa on the|20th|of|may,|1847 that if be expect that the army be to support by force contribution levy upon the country may ruin and exasperate the inhabitant and starve the same discretion be give to that have be to general taylor in this respect general scott for the reason assign by also continue to pay for the article of supply for the army which be draw from the enemy after the army have reach the heart of the most wealthy portion of mexico be suppose that the obstacle which have before that time prevent would not be such as to render impracticable the levy of force contribution for support and on the|1st|of|september and again on the|6th|of|october,|1847 the order be repeat in dispatch address by the secretary of war to general scott and attention be again call to the importance of make the enemy bear the burden of the war by require to furnish the mean of support army and be direct to adopt this policy unless by do so there be danger of deprive the army of the necessary supply copy of these dispatch be forward to general taylor for government on the|31st|of|march last cause an order to be issue to military and naval commander to levy and collect a military contribution upon all vessel and merchandise which may enter any of the port of mexico in military occupation and to apply such contribution toward defray the expense of the war by virtue of the right of conquest and the law of war the conqueror consult own safety or convenience may either exclude foreign commerce altogether from all such port or permit upon such term and condition as may prescribe before the principal port of mexico be blockade by navy the revenue derive from import duty under the law of mexico be pay into the mexican treasury after these port have fall into military possession the blockade be raise and commerce with permit upon prescribe term and condition be open to the trade of all nation upon the payment of duty more moderate in amount than those which have be previously levy by mexico and the revenue which be formerly pay into the mexican treasury be direct to be collect by military and naval officer and apply to the use of army and navy care be take that the officer soldier and sailor of army and navy should be exempt from the operation of the order and as the merchandise import upon which the order operate must be consume by mexican citizen the contribution exact be in effect the seizure of the public revenue of mexico and the application of to own use in direct this measure the object be to compel the enemy to contribute as far as practicable toward the expense of the war for the amount of contribution which have be levy in this form refer to the accompanying report of the secretary of war and of the secretary of the navy by which appear that a sum exceed half|a|million|of|dollars have be collect this amount would undoubtedly have be much large but for the difficulty of keep open communication between the coast and the interior so as to enable the owner of the merchandise import to transport and vend to the inhabitant of the country be confidently expect that this difficulty will to a great extent be soon remove by increase force which have be send to the field measure have recently be adopt by which the internal as well as the external revenue of mexico in all place in military occupation will be

session confer the authority to raise an additional regular force to serve during the war with mexico and to be discharge upon the conclusion and ratification of a treaty of peace invite the attention of congress to the view present by the secretary of war in report upon this subject recommend also that authority be give by law to call for and accept the service of an additional number of volunteer to be exercise at such time and to such extent as the emergency of the service may require in prosecute the war with mexico whilst the utmost care have be take to avoid every just cause of complaint on the part of neutral nation and none have be give liberal privilege have be grant to commerce in the port of the enemy in military occupation the difficulty with the|brazilian|government which at time threaten to interrupt the friendly relation between the country will trust be speedily adjust have receive information that an envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to the|united|state will shortly be appoint by imperial|majesty and be hope that will come instruct and prepare to adjust all remain difference between the government in a manner acceptable and honorable to both in the meantime have every reason to believe that nothing will occur to interrupt amicable relation with brazil have be constant effort to maintain and cultivate the most intimate relation of friendship with all the independent power of and this policy have be attend with the happy result be true that the settlement and payment of many just claim of american citizen against these nation have be long delay the peculiar position in which have be place and the desire on the part of predecessor as well as to grant the utmost indulgence have hitherto prevent these claim from be urge in a manner demand by strict justice the time have arrive when ought to be finally adjust and liquidate and effort be now make for that purpose be proper to inform that the|government|of|peru have in good faith pay the first installment of the indemnity of each and the great portion of the interest due thereon in execution of the convention between that government and the|united|stat the ratification of which be exchange at lima on the|31st|of|october,|1846 the attorney general of the|united|state early in august last complete the adjudication of the claim under this convention and make report thereon in

american citizen there be subject to no law whatever crime may be commit with impunity and debt may be contract without any mean to enforce payment inconvenience have already result from the omission of congress to legislate upon the subject and still great be apprehend the british authority in china have already complain that this government have not provide for the punishment of crime or the enforcement of contract against american citizen in that country whilst government have establish tribunal by which an american citizen can recover debt due from british subject accustomed as the chinese be to summary justice could not be make to comprehend why criminal who be citizen of the|united|state should escape with impunity in violation of treaty obligation whilst the punishment of a chinese who have commit any crime against an american citizen would be rigorously exact indeed the consequence may be fatal to american citizen in china should a flagrant crime be commit by any of upon a chinese and should trial and punishment not follow accord to the requisition of the treaty this may disturb if not destroy friendly relation with that empire and cause an interruption of valuable commerce treaty with the secretary of state have submit an estimate to defray the expense of open diplomatic relation with the|papal|state the interesting political event now in progress in

republics of bolivia guatemala and ecuador the manifest importance of cultivate the most friendly relation with all the independent states upon this continent have induce to recommend appropriation necessary for the maintenance of these mission recommend to congress that an appropriation be make to be pay to the|spanish|government for the purpose of distribution among the claimant in the amistad case entertain the conviction that this be due to spain under the treaty of the 20th of october and moreover that from the earnest manner in which the claim continue to be urge so long as shall remain unsettled will be a source of irritation and discord between the country which may prove highly prejudicial to the interest of the|united|state good policy no less than a faithful compliance with treaty obligation require that the inconsiderable appropriation demand should be make a detailed statement of the condition of the finance will be present in the annual report of the secretary of the treasury the import for the|last|fiscal|year end on the|30th|of|june,|1847 be of the value of of which the amount export be leave in the country for domestic use the value of the export for the same period be of which consist of domestic production and of foreign article the receipt into the treasury for the same period amount to of which there be derive from custom from sale of public land and from incidental and miscellaneous source the|last|fiscal|year during which this amount be receive embrace five|month under the operation of the tariff act of and seven|month during which the tariff act of be in force during the|five|months under the act of the amount receive from custom be and during the|seven|months under the act of the amount receive be the net revenue from custom during the|year|ending|on|the|1st|of|december,|1846 be the|last|year under the operation of the tariff act of be and the net revenue from custom during the|year|ending|on|the|1st|of|december,|1847 be the|first|year under the operation of the tariff act of be about|$31,500,000 be an increase of revenue for the|first|year under the tariff of of more|than|$8,500,000 over that of the|last|year under the tariff of the expenditure during the|fiscal|year|ending|on|the|30th|of|june last be of which be on account payment of principal and interest of the public debt include treasury note redeem and not fund the expenditure exclusive of payment of public debt be be estimate that the receipt into the treasury for the|fiscal|year|ending|on|the|30th|of|june,|1848 include the balance in the treasury on the|1st|of|july|last will amount to of which be estimate will be derive from custom from the sale of the public land from incidental source elude sale make by the solicitor of the treasury and from loan already authorize by law which together with the balance in the treasury on the|1st|of|july|last make the sum estimate the expenditure for the same period if peace with mexico shall not be conclude and the army shall be increase as be propose will amount include the necessary payment on account of principal and interest of the public debt and treasury note to on the|1st|of|the|present|month the amount of the public debt actually incur include treasury note be the public debt due on the 4th of march include treasury note be and consequently the addition make to the public debt since that time be of the loan of three|million authorize by the|act|of|the|28th|of|january,|1847 the sum of five|million be pay out to the public creditor or exchange at par for specie the remain eighteen|million be offer for specie to the high bidder not below par by an advertisement issue by the secretary of the treasury and publish from the|9th|of|february until the|10th|of|april,|1847 when be award to the several high bidder at premium vary from eighth of per cent to per cent above par the premium have be pay into the treasury and the sum award deposit in specie in the treasury as fast as be require by the want of the government to meet the expenditure for the remainder of the present and for the|next|fiscal|year end on the|30th|of|june,|1849 a further loan in aid of the ordinary revenue of the government will be necessary retain a sufficient surplus in the treasury the loan require for the remainder of will be about|$18,500,000 if the duty on tea and coffee be impose and the graduation of the price of the public land shall be make at an early period of session as recommend the loan for may be reduce to the loan may be further reduce by whatever amount of expenditure can be save by military contribution collect in mexico the most vigorous measure for the augmentation of these contribution have be direct and a very considerable sum be expect from that source amount can not however be calculate with any certainty be recommend that the loan to be make be authorize upon the same term and for the same time as that which be authorize under the provision of the|act|of|the|28th|of|january,|1847 should the war with mexico be continue until the|30th|of|june,|1849 be estimate that a further loan of will be require for the|fiscal|year|ending|on|that|day in case no duty be impose on tea and coffee and the public land be not reduce and graduate in price and no military contribution shall be collect in mexico if the duty on tea and coffee be impose and the land be reduce and graduate in price as propose the loan may be reduce to and will be subject to be still further reduce by the amount of the military contribution which may be collect in mexico be not propose however at present to ask congress for authority to negotiate this loan for the|next|fiscal|year as be hope that the loan ask for the remainder of aid by military contribution which may be collect in mexico may be sufficient if contrary to expectation there should be a necessity for the fact will be communicate to congress in time for action during the present session in no event will a sum exceed of this amount be need before the meeting of the session of congress in december,|1848 the act of the|30th|of|july,|1846 reduce the duty on import have be in force since the|1st|of|december last and be gratify to state that all the beneficial effect which be anticipate from operation have be fully realize the public revenue derive from custom during the|year|ending|on|the|1st|of|december,|1847 exceed by more|than|$8,000,000 the amount receive in the|preceding|year under the operation of the|act|of|1842 which be supersede and repeal by effect be visible in the great and almost unexampled prosperity which prevail in every branch of business while the repeal of the prohibitory and restrictive duty of the act of and the substitution in place of reasonable revenue rate levy on article import accord to actual value have increase the revenue and augment foreign trade all the great interest of the country have be advance and promote the great and important interest of agriculture which have be not only too much neglect but actually tax under the protective policy for the benefit of other interest have be relieve of the burden which that policy impose on and farmer and planter under a more just and liberal commercial policy be find new and profitable market abroad for augmented product commerce be rapidly increase and be extend more widely the circle of international exchange great as have be the increase of import during the|past|year export of domestic product sell in foreign market have be still great navigating interest be eminently prosperous the number of vessel build in the|united|state have be great than during any precede period of equal length large profit have be derive by those who have construct as well as by those who have navigate should the ratio of increase in the number of merchant vessel be progressive and be as great for the future as during the|past|year the time be not distant when tonnage and commercial marine will be large than that of any other nation in the world whilst the interest of agriculture of commerce and of navigation have be enlarge and invigorate be highly gratify to observe that manufacture be also in a prosperous condition none of the ruinous effect upon this interest which be apprehend by some as the result of the operation of the revenue system establish by the act of have be experience on the contrary the number of manufactory and the amount of capital invest in be steadily and rapidly increase afford gratifying proof that american enterprise and skill employ in this branch of domestic industry with no other advantage than those fairly and incidentally accrue from a just system of revenue duty be abundantly able to meet successfully all competition from abroad and still derive fair and remunerating profit while capital invest in manufacture be yield adequate and fair profit under the new system the wage of labor whether employ in manufacture agriculture commerce or navigation have be augment the toil million whose daily labor furnish the supply of food and raiment and all the necessary and comfort of life be receive high wage and more steady and permanent employment than in any other country or at any previous period of own history so successful have be all branch of industry that a foreign war which generally diminish the resource of a nation have in no essential degree retard onward progress or check general prosperity with such gratify evidence of prosperity and of the successful operation of the revenue act of every consideration of public policy recommend that shall remain unchanged be hope that the system of impost duty which establish may be regard as the permanent policy of the country and that the great interest affect by may not again be subject to be injuriously disturb as have heretofore be by frequent and sometimes sudden change for the purpose of increase the revenue and without change or modify the rate impose by the act of on the dutiable article embrace by provision again recommend to favorable consideration the expediency of levy a revenue duty on tea and coffee the policy which exempt these article from duty during peace and when the revenue to be derive from be not need cease to exist when the country be engage in war and require the use of all of available resource be a tax which would be so generally diffuse among the people that would be feel oppressively by none and be complain of by none be believe that there be not in the list of import article any which be more properly the subject of war duty than tea and coffee be estimate that would be derive annually by a moderate duty impose on these article should congress avail of this additional source of revenue not only would the amount of the public loan render necessary by the war with mexico be diminish to that extent but the public credit and the public confidence in the ability and determination of the government to meet all engagement promptly would be more firmly establish and the reduce amount of the loan which may be necessary to negotiate could probably be obtain at cheap rate congress be therefore call upon to determine whether be wise to impose the war duty recommend or by omit to do so increase the public debt annually so long as loan shall be require to prosecute the war and afterwards provide in some other form to pay the semiannual interest upon and ultimately to extinguish the principal if in addition to these duty congress should graduate and reduce the price of such of the public land as experience have prove will not command the price place upon by the government an additional annual income to the treasury of of dollar be estimate would be derive from this source should both measure receive the sanction of congress the annual amount of public debt necessary to be contract during the continuance of the war would be reduce near the duty recommend to be levy on tea and coffee be propose shall be limit in duration to the end of the war and until the public debt render necessary to be contract by shall be discharge the amount of the public debt to be contract should be limit to the low practicable sum and should be extinguish as early after the conclusion of the war as the mean of the treasury will permit with this view be recommend that as soon as the war shall be over all the surplus in the treasury not need for other indispensable object shall constitute a sinking fund and be apply to the purchase of the fund debt and that authority be confer by law for that purpose the act of the|6th|of|august,|1846 to establish a warehousing system have be in operation more|than|a|year and have prove to be an important auxiliary to the tariff act of in augment the revenue and extend the commerce of the country whilst have tend to enlarge commerce have be beneficial to manufacture by diminish force sale at auction of foreign good at low price to raise the duty to be advance on and by check fluctuation in the market the system although sanction by the experience of other country be entirely new in the|united|state and be susceptible of improvement in some of provision the secretary of the treasury upon whom be devolve large discretionary power in carry this measure into effect have collect and be now collate the practical result of the system in other country where have long be establish and will report at an early period of session such further regulation suggest by the investigation as may render still more effective and beneficial by the act to provide for the well organization of the treasury and for the collection safe keeping and disbursement of the public revenue all bank be discontinue as fiscal agent of the government and the paper currency issue by be no longer permit to be receive in payment of public due the constitutional treasury create by this act go into operation on the|1st|of|january|last under the system establish by the public money have be collect safely keep and disburse by the direct agency of officer of the government in gold and silver and transfer of large amount have be make from point of collection to point of disbursement without loss to the treasury or injury or inconvenience to the trade of the country while the fiscal operation of the government have be conduct with regularity and ease under this system have have a salutary effect in check and prevent an undue inflation of the paper currency issue by the bank which exist under state charter require as do all due to the government to be pay in gold and silver effect be to restrain excessive issue of bank paper by the bank disproportione to the specie in vault for the reason that be at all time liable to be call on by the holder of note for redemption in order to obtain specie for the payment of duty and other public due the bank therefore must keep business within prudent limit and be always in a condition to meet such call or run the hazard of be compel to suspend specie payment and be thereby discredit the amount of specie import into the|united|state during the|last|fiscal|year be of which there be retain in the country have the former financial system prevail and the public money be place on deposit in the bank nearly the whole of this amount would have go into vault not to be throw into circulation by but to be withhold from the hand of the people as a currency and make the basis of new and enormous issue of bank paper a large proportion of the specie import have be pay into the treasury for public due and after have be to a great extent recoine at the mint have be pay out to the public creditor and go into circulation as a currency among the people the amount of gold and silver coin now in circulation in the country be large than at any former period the financial system establish by the constitutional treasury have be thus far eminently successful in operation and recommend an adherence to all essential provision and especially to that vital provision which wholly separate the government from all connection with bank and exclude bank paper from all revenue receipt in some of detail not involve general principle the system be defective and will require modification these defect and such amendment as be deem important be set forth in the last annual report of the secretary of the treasury these amendment be again recommend to the early and favorable consideration of congress during the|past|year the coinage at the mint and branch have exceed this have consist chiefly in convert the coin of foreign country into american coin the large amount of foreign coin import have be receive at new|york and if a branch mint be establish at that city all the foreign coin receive at that port could at once be convert into own coin without the expense risk and delay of transport to the mint for that purpose and the amount recoine would be much large experience have prove that foreign coin and especially foreign gold coin will not circulate extensively as a currency among the people the important measure of extend specie circulation both of gold and silver and of diffuse among the people can only be effect by convert such foreign coin into american coin repeat the recommendation contain in last annual message for the establishment of a branch of the mint of the|united|state at the city of new|york all the public land which have be survey and be ready for market have be proclaim for sale during the|past|year the quantity offer and to be offer for sale under proclamation issue since the|1st|of|january last amount to 9,138,531|acre the prosperity of the|western|state and territories in which these land lie will be advance by speedy sale by withhold from market growth and increase of population would be retard while thousand of enterprising and meritorious frontier population would be deprive of the opportunity of secure freehold for and family but in addition to the general consideration which render the early sale of these land proper be a leading object at this time to derive as large a sum as possible from this source and thus diminish by that amount the public loan render necessary by the existence of a foreign war be estimate that not less|than|10,000,000|acre of the public land will be survey and be in a condition to be proclaim for sale during the|year|1848 in last annual message present the reason which in judgment render proper to graduate and reduce the price of such of the public land as have remain unsold for long period after have be offer for sale at public auction many|millions|of|acre of public land lie within the limit of several of the|western|state have be offer in the market and be subject to sale at private entry for more|than|twenty|year and large quantity for more|than|thirty|year at the low price prescribe by the exist law and have be find that will not command that price must remain unsold and uncultivated for an indefinite period unless the price demand for by the government shall be reduce no satisfactory reason be perceive why should be longer hold at rate above real value at the present period an additional reason exist for adopt the measure recommend when the country be engage in a foreign war and must necessarily resort to loan would seem to be the dictate of wisdom that should avail of all resource and thus limit the amount of the public indebtedness to the low possible sum recommend that the exist law on the subject of preemption right be amend and modify so as to operate prospectively and to embrace all who may settle upon the public land and make improvement upon before be survey as well as afterwards in all case where such settlement may be make after the indian title shall have be extinguish if the right of preemption be thus extend will embrace a large and meritorious class of citizen will increase the number of small freeholder upon border who will be enable thereby to educate child and otherwise improve condition while will be find at all time as have ever prove to be in the|hour of danger to country among hardiest and good volunteer soldier ever ready to attend to service in case of emergency and among the last to leave the field as long as an enemy remain to be encounter such a policy will also impress these patriotic pioneer emigrant with deep feeling of gratitude for the parental care of government when find dear interest secure to by the permanent law of the land and that be no longer in danger of lose home and hard earn improvement by be bring into competition with a more wealthy class of purchaser at the land sale the attention of congress be invite at last and the precede session to the importance of establish a territorial government over possession in oregon and be to be regret that there be no legislation on the subject citizen who inhabit that distant region of country be still leave without the protection of law or any regularly organize government before the question of limit and boundary of the|territory|of|oregon be definitely settle from the necessity of condition the inhabitant have establish a temporary government of own besides the want of legal authority for continue such a government be wholly inadequate to protect in right of person and property or to secure to the enjoyment of the privilege of other citizen to which be entitle under the|united|state should have the right of suffrage be represent in a territorial legislature and by a delegate in congress and possess all the right and privilege which citizen of other portion of the territory of the|united|state have heretofore enjoy or may now enjoy judicial system revenue law law regulate trade and intercourse with the indian tribe and the protection of law generally should be extend over in addition to the inhabitant in that territory who have previously emigrate to large number of citizen have follow during the|present|year and be not doubt that during the next and subsequent year number will be greatly increase congress at last session establish post route lead to oregon and between different point within that territory and authorize the establishment of post - office at astoria and such other place on the coast of the pacific within the territory of the|united|state as the public interest may require post - office have accordingly be establish deputy postmaster appoint and provision make for the transportation of the mail the preservation of peace with the indian tribe reside west of the|rocky|mountain will render proper that authority should be give by law for the appointment of an adequate number of indian agent to reside among recommend that a surveyor general 's office be establish in that territory and that the public land be survey and bring into market at an early period recommend also that grant upon liberal term of limited quantity of the public land be make to all citizen of the|united|state who have emigrate or may hereafter within a prescribed period emigrate to oregon and settle upon these hardy and adventurous citizen who have encounter the danger and privation of a long and toilsome journey and have at length find an abide place for and family upon the utmost verge of western limit should be secure in the home which have improve by labor refer to the accompanying report of the secretary of war for a detailed account of the operation of the various branch of the public service connect with the department under charge the duty devolve on this department have be unusually onerous and responsible during the|past|year and have be discharge with ability and success pacific

the army on the road between the western border of missouri and santa|fe these depredation which be suppose to have be commit by band from the region of new|mexico have be arrest by the presence of a military force order out for that purpose some outrage have be perpetrate by a portion of the northwestern band upon the weak and comparatively defenseless neighboring tribe prompt measure be take to prevent such occurrence in future between|1,000|and|2,000 indians belong to several tribe have be remove during the|year from the east of the mississippi to the country allot to west of that river as permanent home and arrangement have be make for other to follow since the|treaty|of|1846 with the cherokees the feud among appear to have subside and have become more united and content than have be for many|years|past the commissioner appoint in pursuance of the act of june|27,|1846 to settle claim arise under the treaty of with that tribe have execute duty and after a patient investigation and a full and fair examination of all the case bring before close labor in the|month|of|july|last this be the fourth board of commissioner which have be organize under this treaty ample opportunity have be afford to all those interested to bring forward claim no doubt be entertain that impartial justice have be do by the late board and that all valid claim embrace by the treaty have be consider and allow this result and the final settlement to be make with this tribe under the treaty of which will be complete and lay before during session will adjust all question of controversy between and the|united|state and produce a state of relation with simple well define and satisfactory under the discretionary authority confer by the act of the of march last the annuity due to the various tribe have be pay during the|present|year to the head of family instead of to chief or such person as may designate as require by the law previously exist this mode of payment have give general satisfaction to the great body of the indians justice have be do to and be grateful to the government for a few chief and interested person may object to this mode of payment but be believe to be the only mode of prevent fraud and imposition from be practice upon the great body of common indians constitute a majority of all the tribe be gratify to perceive that a number of the tribe have recently manifest an increase interest in the establishment of school among and be make rapid advance in agriculture some of produce a sufficient quantity of food for support and in some case a surplus to dispose of to neighbor the comfort by which those who have receive even a very limited education and have engage in agriculture be surround tend gradually to draw off less civilized brother from the precarious mean of subsistence by the chase to habit of labor and civilization the accompanying report of the secretary of the navy present a satisfactory and gratify account of the condition and operation of the naval service during the|past|year commerce have be pursue with increase activity and with safety and success in every quarter of the globe under the protection of flag which the navy have cause to be respect in the most distant sea in the|gulf|of|mexico and in the pacific the officer and man of squadron have display distinguished gallantry and perform valuable service in the early stage of the war with mexico port on both coast be blockade and more recently many of have be capture and hold by the navy when act in cooperation with the land force the naval officer and man have perform gallant and distinguished service on land as well as on water and deserve the high commendation of the country while other maritime power be add to navy large number of war steamer be a wise policy on part to make similar addition to navy the war steamer authorize by the act of the|3d|of|march be in course of construction in addition to the war steamer authorize by this act the secretary of the navy have in pursuance of provision enter into contract for the construction of steamer to be employ in the transportation of mail from new|york to new|orleans touch at charleston savannah and havana and from

the whole of war steamer subject to be take for public use as further contract for the transportation of the mail to foreign country may be authorize by congress this number may be enlarge indefinitely the enlightened policy by which a rapid communication with the various distant part of the globe be establish by mean of american build sea steamer would find an ample reward in the increase of commerce and in make country and resource more favorably know abroad but the national advantage be still great of have naval officer make familiar with steam navigation and of have the privilege of take the ship already equip for immediate service at a moment 's notice and will be cheaply purchase by the compensation to be pay for the transportation of the mail in over and above the postage receive a just national pride no less than commercial interest would seem to favor the policy of augment the number of this description of vessel can be build in country cheap and in great number than in any other in the world refer to the accompanying report of the|postmaster general for a detailed and satisfactory account of the condition and operation of that department during the|past|year be gratify to find that within so short a period after the reduction in the rate of postage and notwithstanding the great increase of mail service the revenue receive for the|year will be sufficient to defray all the expense and that no further aid will be require from the treasury for that purpose the first of the american mail steamer authorize by the act of the|3d|of|march be

discriminate postage on all letter and other mailable matter which take out to great|britain or which go into the british post - office on way to france and other part of europe the effect of the order of the british post - office be to subject all letter and other matter transport by american steamer to double postage postage have be previously pay on to the|united|state while letter transport in british steamer be subject to pay but a single postage this measure be adopt with the avow object of protect the british line of mail steamer now run between boston and liverpool and if permit to continue must speedily put an end to the transportation of all letter and other matter by american steamer and give to british steamer a monopoly of the business a just and fair reciprocity be all that desire and on this must insist by law no such discrimination be make against british steamer bring letter into port but all letter arrive in the|united|state be subject to the same rate of postage whether bring in british or american vessel refer to the report of the|postmaster general for a full statement of the fact of the case and of the step take by to correct this inequality have exert all the power confer upon by the exist law the minister of the|united|state at london have bring the subject to the attention of the|british|government and be now engage in negotiation for the

state of war exist between that government and the|united|state and for the purpose of enable the government of the|united|state to prosecute say war to a speedy and successful termination authority be vest in the president to employ the naval and military force of the|united|state have be unalterable purpose since the commencement of hostility by mexico and the declaration of the existence of war by congress to prosecute the war in which the country be unavoidably involve with the utmost energy with a view to speedy and successful termination by an honorable peace accordingly all the operation of naval and military force have be direct with this view while the sword have be hold in hand and military movement press forward into the enemy 's country and coast invest by navy the tender of an honorable peace have be constantly present to mexico in the other hitherto the overture of peace which have be make by this government have not be accept by mexico with a view to avoid a protract war which hesitancy and delay on part would be so well calculated to produce inform in annual message of the|8th|december|last that the war would continue to be prosecute with vigor as the good mean of secure peace and recommend to early and favorable consideration the measure propose by the secretary of war in report accompany that message in message of the 4th january last these and other measure deem to be essential to speedy and successful termination of the war and the attainment of a just and honorable peace be recommend to early and favorable consideration the bad state of thing which could exist in a war with such a power as mexico would be a course of indecision and inactivity on part be charge by the constitution and the law with the conduct of the war have avail of all the mean at command to prosecute with energy and vigor the act to raise for a limited time an additional military force and for other purpose and which authorize the raising of additional regiment to the|regular|army to serve during the war and to be disband at termination which be present to on the 11th instant and approve on that|day will constitute an important part of military force these regiment will be raise and move to the seat of war with the least practicable delay will be perceive that this act make no provision for the organization into brigade and division of the increase force which authorize nor for the appointment of general officer to command will be proper that authority be give by law to make such organization and to appoint by and with the advice and consent of the senate such number of major general and brigadier general as the efficiency of the service may demand the number of officer of these grade now in service be not more than be require for respective command but further legislative action during present session will in judgment be require and to which be duty respectfully to invite attention should the war contrary to earnest desire be protract to the close of the term of service of the volunteer now in mexico who engage for twelve|months an additional volunteer force will probably become necessary to supply place many of the volunteer now serve in mexico be not doubt will cheerfully engage at the conclusion of present term to serve during the war would constitute a more efficient force than could be speedily obtain by accept the service of any new corps who may offer service would have the advantage of the experience and discipline of a year 's service and will have become accustomed to the climate and be in less danger than new levy of suffering from the disease of the country recommend therefore that authority be give to accept the service of such of the volunteer now in mexico as the state of the public service may require and who may at the termination of present term voluntarily engage to serve during the war with mexico and that provision be make for commission the officer should this measure receive the favorable consideration of congress be recommend that a bounty be grant to upon voluntarily extend term of service this would not only be due to these gallant man but would be economy to the government because if discharge at the end of the month the government would be bind to incur a heavy expense in bring back to home and in send to the seat of war new corps of fresh troop to supply place by the|act|of|the|13th|of|may last the president be authorize to accept the service of volunteer in company battalion squadron and regiment but no provision be make for fill up vacancy which may occur by death or discharge from the service on account of sickness or other casualty in consequence of this omission many of the corps now in service have be much reduce in number nor be any provision make for fill vacancy of regimental or company officer who may die or resign information have be receive at of the resignation of more|than|100 of these officer be appoint by the state authority and no information have be receive except in a few instance that place have be fill and the efficiency of the service have be impair from this cause to remedy these defect recommend that authority be give to accept the service of individual volunteer to fill up the place of such as may die or become unfit for the service and be discharge and that provision be also make for fill the place of regimental and company officer who may die or resign by such provision the volunteer corps may be constantly keep full or may approximate the maximum number authorize and call into service in the first instance while be deem to be true policy to prosecute the war in the manner indicate and thus make the enemy feel pressure and evil shall be at all time ready with the authority confer on by the constitution and with all the mean which may be place at command by congress to conclude a just and honorable peace of equal importance with an energetic and vigorous prosecution of the war be the mean require to defray expense and to uphold and maintain the public credit in annual message of the|8th december last submit for the consideration of congress the propriety of impose as a war measure revenue duty on some of the article now embrace in the free list the principal article now exempt from duty from which any considerable revenue could be derive be tea and coffee a moderate revenue duty on these article be estimate would produce annually an amount exceed though in a period of peace when ample mean could be derive from duty on other article for the support of the government may have be deem proper not to resort to a duty on these article yet when the country be engage in a foreign war and all resource be demand to meet the unavoidable increase expenditure in maintain army in the field no sound reason be perceive why should not avail of the revenue which may be derive from this source the objection which have heretofore exist to the imposition of these duty be applicable to a state of peace when be not need be now however engage in a foreign war need money to prosecute and to maintain the public honor and credit can not be doubt that the patriotic people of the|united|state would cheerfully and without complaint submit to the payment of this additional duty or any other that may be necessary to maintain the honor of the country provide for the unavoidable expense of the government and to uphold the public credit be recommend that any duty which may be impose on these article be limit in duration to the period of the war an additional annual revenue be estimate of of dollar would be derive from the graduation and reduction of the price of such of the public land as have be long offer in the market at the minimum price establish by the exist law and have remain unsold and in addition to other reason commend the measure to favorable consideration be recommend as a financial measure the duty suggest on tea and coffee and the graduation and reduction of the price of the public land would secure an additional annual revenue to the treasury of not less than and would thereby prevent the necessity of incur a public debt annually to that amount the interest on which must be pay semiannually and ultimately the debt by a tax on the people be a sound policy and one which have long be approve by the government and people of the|united|state never to resort to loan unless in case of great public emergency and then only for the small amount which the public necessity will permit the increase revenue which the measure now recommend would produce would moreover enable the government to negotiate a loan for any additional sum which may be find to be need with more facility and at cheap rate than can be do without under the injunction of the constitution which make duty from time to time to give to congress information of the state of the union and to recommend to consideration such measure as shall be judge necessary and expedient respectfully and earnestly invite the action of congress on the measure herein present for consideration the public good as well as a sense of responsibility to common constituent in judgment imperiously demand that should present for enlighten consideration and invoke favorable action upon before the close of present session transcript to the senate and house|of|representatif of the|united|state in order to prosecute the war against mexico with vigor and success be necessary that authority should be promptly give by congress to increase the|regular|army and to remedy exist defect in organization with this view favorable attention be invite to the annual report of the secretary of war which accompany message of the 8th instant in which recommend that additional regiment of regular troop shall be raise to serve during the war of the additional regiment of volunteer which have be call for from several of the states some have be promptly raise but this have not be the case in regard to all the exist law require that should be organize by the independent action of the state government have in some instance occasion considerable delay and be yet uncertain when the troop require can be ready for service in the field be settle policy to maintain in time of peace as small a regular|army as the exigency of the public service will permit in a state of war notwithstanding the great advantage with which volunteer citizen soldier can be bring into the field this small regular|army must be increase in number in order to render the whole force more efficient additional officer as well as man then become indispensable under the circumstance of service a peculiar propriety exist for increase the officer especially in the high grade the number of such officer who from age and other cause be render incapable of active service in the field have seriously impair the efficiency of the army from the report of the secretary of war appear that about|two|third of the whole number of regimental field officer be either permanently disabled or be necessarily detach from command on other duty the long enjoyment of peace have prevent from experience much embarrassment from this cause but now in a state of war conduct in a foreign country have produce serious injury to the public service an efficient organization of the army compose of regular and volunteer whilst prosecute the war in mexico be believe would require the appointment of a general officer to take the command of all military force in the field upon the conclusion of the war the service of such an officer would no longer be necessary and should be dispense with upon the reduction of the army to a peace establishment recommend that provision be make by law for the appointment of such a general officer to serve during the war be respectfully recommend that early action should be have by congress upon the suggestion submit for consideration as necessary to insure active and efficient service in prosecute the war before the present favorable season for military operation in the enemy 's country shall have pass away transcript fellow citizens of the senate and of the|house|of|representatives in resume labor in the service of the people be a subject of congratulation that there have be no period in past history when all the element of national prosperity have be so fully develop since last session no afflict dispensation have visit country general good health have prevail abundance have crown the toil of the husbandman and labor in all branch be receive an ample reward while education science and the art be rapidly enlarge the mean of social happiness the progress of country in career of greatness not only in the vast extension of territorial limit and the rapid increase of population but in resource and wealth and in the happy condition of people be without an example in the history of nation as the wisdom strength and beneficence of free institution be unfold every day add fresh motif to contentment and fresh incentive to patriotism devout and sincere acknowledgment be due to the gracious giver|of|all|good for the numberless blessing which beloved country enjoy be a source of high satisfaction to know that the relation of the|united|state with all other nation with a single exception be of the most amicable character sincerely attach to the policy of peace early adopt and steadily pursue by this government have anxiously desire to cultivate and cherish friendship and commerce with every foreign power the spirit and habit of the american people be favorable to the maintenance of such international harmony in adhere to this wise policy a preliminary and paramount duty obviously consist in the protection of national interest from encroachment or sacrifice and national honor from reproach these must be maintain at any hazard admit of no compromise or neglect and must be scrupulously and constantly guard in vigilant vindication collision and conflict with foreign power may sometimes become unavoidable such have be scrupulous adherence to the dictate of justice in all foreign intercourse that though steadily and rapidly advance in prosperity and power have give no just cause of complaint to any nation and have enjoy the blessing of peace for more|than|thirty|year from a policy so sacred to humanity and so salutary in effect upon political system should never be induce voluntarily to depart the exist war with mexico be neither desire nor provoke by the|united|state on the contrary all honorable mean be resort to avert after year of endurance of aggravate and unredressed wrong on part mexico in violation of solemn treaty stipulation and of every principle of justice recognize by civilized nation commence hostility and thus by own act force the war upon long before the advance of army to the left bank of the|rio|grande have ample cause of war against mexico and have the|united|state resort to this extremity may have appeal to the whole civilized world for the justice of cause deem to be duty to present to on the present occasion a condensed review of the injury have sustain of the cause which lead to the war and of progress since commencement this be render the more necessary because of the misapprehension which have to some extent prevail as to origin and true character the war have be represent as unjust and unnecessary and as of aggression on part upon a weak and injured enemy such erroneous view though entertain by but few have be widely and extensively circulate not only at home but have be spread throughout mexico and the whole world a more effectual mean could not have be devise to encourage the enemy and protract the war than to advocate and adhere to cause and thus give aid and comfort be a source of national pride and exultation that the great body of people have throw no such obstacle in the way of the government in prosecute the war successfully but have show to be eminently patriotic and ready to vindicate country 's honor and interest at any sacrifice the alacrity and promptness with which volunteer force rush to the field on country 's call prove not only patriotism but deep conviction that cause be just the wrong which have suffer from mexico almost ever since become an independent power and the patient endurance with which have bear be without a parallel in the history of modern civilized nation there be reason to believe that if these wrong have be resent and resist in the first instance the present war may have be avoid outrage however permit to pass with impunity almost necessarily encourage the perpetration of another until at last mexico seem to attribute to weakness and indecision on part a forbearance which be the offspring of magnanimity and of a sincere desire to preserve friendly relation with a sister republic scarcely have mexico achieve independence which the|united|state be the first among the nation to acknowledge when commence the system of insult and spoliation which have ever since pursue citizen engage in lawful commerce be imprison vessel seize and flag insult in port if money be want the lawless seizure and confiscation of merchant vessel and cargo be a ready resource and if to accomplish purpose become necessary to imprison the owner captain and crew be do ruler supersede ruler in mexico in rapid succession but still there be no change in this system of depredation the|government|of the|united|state make repeat reclamation on behalf of citizen but these be answer by the perpetration of new outrage promise of redress make by mexico in the most solemn form be postpone or evade the file and record of the|department|of|state contain conclusive proof of numerous lawless act perpetrate upon the property and person of citizen by mexico and of wanton insult to national flag the interposition of government to obtain redress be again and again invoke under circumstance which no nation ought to disregard be hope that these outrage would cease and that mexico would be restrain by the law which regulate the conduct of civilized nation in intercourse with each other after the treaty of amity commerce and navigation of the 5th of april,|1831 be conclude between the republics but this hope soon prove to be vain the course of seizure and confiscation of the property of citizen the violation of person and the insult to flag pursue by mexico previous to that time be scarcely suspend for even a brief period although the treaty so clearly define the right and duty of the respective party that be impossible to misunderstand or mistake in less|than|seven|year after the conclusion of that treaty grievance have become so intolerable that in the opinion of president jackson should no longer be endure in message to congress in february present to the consideration of that body and declare the length of time since some of the injury have be commit the repeat and unavaile application for redress the wanton character of some of the outrage upon the property and person of citizen upon the officer and flag of the|united|state independent of recent insult to this government and people by the late extraordinary mexican minister would justify in the eye of all nation immediate war in a spirit of kindness and forbearance however recommend reprisal as a milder mode of redress declare that war should not be use as a remedy by just and generous nation confide in strength for injury commit if can be honorably avoid and add have occur to that consider the present embarrassed condition of that country should act with both wisdom and moderation by give to mexico more opportunity to atone for the past before take redress into own hand to avoid all misconception on the part of mexico as well as to protect own national character from reproach this opportunity should be give with the avow design and full preparation to take immediate satisfaction if should not be obtain on a repetition of the demand for to this end recommend that an act be pass authorize reprisal and the use of the naval force of the|united|state by the executive against mexico to enforce in the event of a refusal by the|mexican|government to come to an amicable adjustment of the matter in controversy between upon another demand thereof make from on board out of vessel of war on the coast of mexico committee of both houses of congress to which this message of the president be refer fully sustain view of the character of the wrong which have suffer from mexico and recommend that another demand for redress should be make before authorize war or reprisal the|committee|on|foreign|relation of the senate in report say after such a demand should prompt justice be refuse by the|mexican|government may appeal to all nation not only for the equity and moderation with which shall have act toward a sister republic but for the necessity which will then compel to seek redress for wrong either by actual war or by reprisal the subject will then be present before congress at the commencement of the next session in a clear and distinct form and the committee can not doubt but that such measure will be immediately adopt as may be necessary to vindicate the honor of the country and insure ample reparation to injure fellow citizen the|committee|on|foreign|affairs|of|the|house|of|representative make a similar recommendation in report say fully concur with the president that ample cause exist for take redress into own hand and believe that should be justify in the opinion of other nation for take such a step but be willing to try the experiment of another demand make in the most solemn form upon the justice of the|mexican|government before any further proceeding be adopt no difference of opinion upon the subject be believe to have exist in congress at that time the executive and legislative department concur and yet such have be forbearance and desire to preserve peace with mexico that the wrong of which then complain and which give rise to these solemn proceeding not only remain unredressed to this|day but additional cause of complaint of an aggravated character have ever since be accumulate shortly after these proceeding a special messenger be dispatch to mexico to make a final demand for redress and on the|20th|of|july,|1837 the demand be make the reply of the|mexican|government bear date on the|29th|of|the|same|month and contain assurance of the anxious wish of the|mexican|government not to delay the moment of that final and equitable adjustment which be to terminate the exist difficulty between the government that nothing should be leave undone which may contribute to the most speedy and equitable determination of the subject which have so seriously engage the attention of the|american|government that the|"mexican|government would adopt as the only guide for conduct the plain principle of public right the sacred obligation impose by international law and the religious faith of treaty and that whatever reason and justice may dictate respect each case will be do the assurance be further give that the decision of the|mexican|government upon each cause of complaint for which redress have be demand should be communicate to by the mexican minister at washington these solemn assurance in answer to demand for redress be disregard by make however mexico obtain further delay president van|buren in annual message to congress of the 5th of december state that although the large number of demand for redress and many of aggravate case of personal wrong have be now for year before the|mexican|government and some of the cause of national complaint and those of the most offensive character admit of immediate simple and satisfactory reply be only within a|few|day past that any specific communication in answer to last demand make have be receive from the mexican minister and that for not of public complaint have satisfaction be give or offer that but of the case of personal wrong have be favorably consider and that but case of both description out of all those formally present and earnestly press have as yet be decide upon by the|mexican|government president van|buren believe that would be vain to make any further attempt to obtain redress by the ordinary mean within the power of the executive communicate this opinion to congress in the message refer to in which say on a careful and deliberate examination of content of the correspondence with the|mexican|government and consider the spirit manifest by the|mexican|government have become painful duty to return the subject as now stand to congress to whom belong to decide upon the time the mode and the measure of redress have the|united|state at that time adopt compulsory measure and take redress into own hand all difficulty with mexico would probably have be long since adjust and the exist war have be avert magnanimity and moderation on part only have the effect to complicate these difficulty and render an amicable settlement of the more embarrassing that such measure of redress under similar provocation commit by any of the powerful nation of europe would have be promptly resort to by the|united|state can not be doubt the national honor and the preservation of the national character throughout the world as well as own self respect and the protection due to own citizen would have render such a resort indispensable the history of no civilized nation in modern time have present within so brief a period so many wanton attack upon the honor of flag and upon the property and person of citizen as have at that time be bear by the|united|state from the mexican authority and people but mexico be a sister republic on the north|american continent occupy a territory contiguous to own and be in a feeble and distracted condition and these consideration be presume induce congress to forbear still longer instead of take redress into own hand a new negotiation be enter upon with fair promise on the part of mexico but with the real purpose as the event have prove of indefinitely postpone the reparation which demand and which be so justly due this negotiation after more|than|a|year 's delay result in the convention of the|11th|of|april,|1839 for the adjustment of claim of citizen of the|united|states|of|america upon the government of the joint board of commissioner create by this convention to examine and decide upon these claim be not organize until the|month|of|august,|1840 and under the term of the convention be to terminate duty within eighteen|month from that time of the|eighteen|months be consume in preliminary discussion on frivolous and dilatory point raise by the mexican commissioner and be not until the|month|of|december,|1840 that commence the examination of the claim of citizen upon mexico

time the claim which be allow by the board and by the umpire authorize by the convention to decide in case of disagreement between the mexican and american commissioner amount to there be pende before the umpire when the commission expire additional claim which have be examine and award by the american commissioner and have not be allow by the mexican commissioner amount to upon which do not decide allege that authority have cease with the termination of the joint commission besides these claim there be other of american citizen amount to which have be submit to the board and upon which have not time to decide before final adjournment the sum of which have be award to the claimant be a liquidated and ascertained debt due by mexico about which there could be no dispute and which be bind to pay accord to the term of the convention soon after the final award for this amount have be make the|mexican|government ask for a postponement of the time of make payment allege that would be inconvenient to make the payment at the time stipulate in the spirit of forbear kindness toward a sister republic which mexico have so long abuse the|united|state promptly comply with request a second convention be accordingly conclude between the government on the|30th|of|january,|1843 which upon face declare that this new arrangement be enter into for the accommodation of mexico by the term of this convention all the interest due on the award which have be make in favor of the claimant under the convention of the|11th|of|april,|1839 be to be pay to on the|30th|of|april,|1843 and the principal of the say award and the interest accrue thereon be stipulate to be pay in five|years in equal installment every|three|month notwithstanding this new convention be enter into at the request of mexico and for the purpose of relieve from embarrassment the claimant have only receive the interest due on the|30th|of|april,|1843 and of the installment although the payment of the sum thus liquidate and confessedly due by mexico to citizen as indemnity for acknowledge act of outrage and wrong be secure by treaty the obligation of which be ever hold sacred by all just nation yet mexico have violate this solemn engagement by fail and refuse to make the payment the installment due in april|and|july,|1844 under the peculiar circumstance connect with have be assume by the|united|state and discharge to the claimant but be still due by mexico but this be not all of which have just cause of complaint to provide a remedy for the claimant whose case be not decide by the joint commission under the convention of april|11,|1839 be expressly stipulate by the sixth article of the convention of the|30th|of|january,|1843 a new convention shall be enter into for the settlement of all claim of the government and citizen of the|united|state against the|republic|of|mexico which be not finally decide by the late commission which meet in the city of washington and of all claim of the government and citizen of mexico against the|united|state in conformity with this stipulation a third convention be conclude and sign at the city of mexico on the|20th|of|november,|1843 by the plenipotentiary of the government by which provision be make for ascertain and pay these claim in january,|1844 this convention be ratify by the senate of the|united|state with amendment which be manifestly reasonable in character upon a reference of the amendment propose to the|government|of|mexico the same evasion difficulty and delay be interpose which have so long mark the policy of that government toward the|united|state have not even yet decide whether would or would not accede to although the subject have be repeatedly press upon consideration mexico have thus violate a second time the faith of treaty by fail or refuse to carry into effect the sixth article of the convention of january,|1843 such be the history of the wrong which have suffer and patiently endure from mexico through a|long|series|of|year so far from afford reasonable satisfaction for the injury and insult have bear a great aggravation of consist in the fact that while the|united|state anxious to preserve a good understanding with mexico have be constantly but vainly employ in seek redress for past wrong new outrage be constantly occur which have continue to increase cause of complaint and to swell the amount of demand while the citizen of the|united|state be conduct a lawful commerce with mexico under the guaranty of a treaty of amity commerce and navigation many of have suffer all the injury which would have result from open war this treaty instead of afford protection to citizen have be the mean of invite into the port of mexico that may be as have be in numerous instance plunder of property and deprive of personal liberty if dare insist on right have the unlawful seizure of american property and the violation of the personal liberty of citizen to say nothing of the insult to flag which have occur in the port of mexico take place on the high sea would long since have constitute a state of actual war between the country in so long suffer mexico to violate most solemn treaty obligation plunder citizen of property and imprison person without afford any redress have fail to perform of the first and high duty which every government owe to citizen and the consequence have be that many of have be reduce from a state of affluence to bankruptcy the proud name of american citizen which ought to protect all who bear from insult and injury throughout the world have afford no such protection to citizen in mexico have ample cause of war against mexico long before the break out of hostility but even then forbore to take redress into own hand until mexico become the aggressor by invade soil in hostile array and shed the blood of citizen such be the grave cause of complaint on the part of the|united|state against mexico cause which exist long before the annexation of texas to the|american|union and yet animate by the love of peace and a magnanimous moderation do not adopt those measure of redress which under such circumstance be the justified resort of injured nation the annexation of texas to the|united|state constitute no just cause of offense to mexico the pretext that do so be wholly inconsistent and irreconcilable with well authenticate fact connect with the revolution by which texas become independent of mexico that this may be the more manifest may be proper to advert to the cause and to the history of the principal event of that revolution texas constitute a portion of the ancient province of louisiana cede to the|united|state by france in the|year|1803 in the|year|1819 the|united|state by the florida treaty cede to spain all that part of louisiana within the present limit of texas and mexico by the revolution which separate from spain and render an independent nation succeed to the right of the mother country over this territory in the|year|1824 mexico establish a federal constitution under which the|mexican|republic be compose of a number of sovereign states confederate together in a federal union similar to own each of these

other mexican|united|state and of every other power and dominion whatsoever and proclaim the great principle of human liberty that the sovereignty of the state reside originally and essentially in the general mass of the individual who compose to the government under this constitution as well as to that under the federal constitution the people of texas owe allegiance emigrant from foreign country include the|united|state be invite by the colonization law of the state and of the|federal|government to settle in texas advantageous term be offer to induce to leave own country and become mexican citizen this invitation be accept by many of citizen in the full faith that in new home would be govern by law enact by representative elect by and that life liberty and property would be protect by constitutional guaranty similar to those which exist in the republic have leave under a government thus organize continue until the|year|1835 when a military revolution break out in the|city|of|mexico which entirely subvert the federal and state constitution and place a military dictator at the head of the government by a sweeping decree of a congress subservient to the will of the dictator the several state constitution be abolish and the states convert into mere department of the central government the people of texas be unwilling to submit to this usurpation resistance to such tyranny become a high duty texas be fully absolve from all allegiance to the central government|of|mexico from the moment that government have abolish state constitution and in place substitute an arbitrary and despotic central government such be the principal cause of the texan revolution the people of texas at once determine upon resistance and fly to arm in the midst of these important and exciting event however do not omit to place liberty upon a secure and permanent foundation elect member to a convention who in the|month|of|march,|1836 issue a formal declaration that political connection with the mexican nation have forever end and that the people of texas do now constitute a free sovereign and independent republic and be fully invest with all the right and attribute which properly belong to independent nation also adopt for government a liberal republican constitution about the same time santa|anna then the dictator of mexico invade texas with a numerous army for the purpose of subdue people and enforce obedience to arbitrary and despotic government on the|21st|of|april,|1836 be meet by the texan citizen soldier and on that|day be achieve by the memorable victory of san|jacinto by which conquer independence consider the number engage on the respective side history do not record a more brilliant achievement santa|anna be among the captive in the|month|of|may,|1836 santa|anna acknowledge by a treaty with the texan authority in the most solumn form the full entire and perfect independence of the|republic|of|texas be true be then a prisoner of war but be equally true that have fail to reconquer texas and have meet with signal defeat that authority have not be revoke and that by virtue of this treaty obtain personal release by hostility be suspend and the army which have invade texas under command return in pursuance of this arrangement unmoleste to mexico from the|day that the battle of san|jacinto be fight until the|present|hour mexico have never possess the power to reconquer texas in the language of the secretary of state of the|united|state in a dispatch to minister in mexico under date of the|8th|of|july mexico may have choose to consider and may still choose to consider texas as have be at all time since and as still continue a rebellious province but the world have be oblige to take a very different view of the matter from the time of the battle of san|jacinto in april,|1836 to the present moment texas have exhibit the same external sign of national independence as mexico and with quite as much stability of government practically free and independent acknowledge as a political sovereignty by the principal power of the world no hostile foot find rest within territory for six|or|seven|years and mexico refrain for all that period from any further attempt to reestablish own authority over that territory can not but be surprising to find mr. de|bocanegra the secretary of foreign affair of mexico complain that for that whole period citizen of the|united|state or government have be favor the rebel of texas and supply with vessel ammunition and money as if the war for the reduction of the|province|of|texas have be constantly prosecute by mexico and success prevent by these influence from abroad in the same dispatch the secretary of state affirm since the|united|state have regard texas as an independent sovereignty as much as mexico and that trade and commerce with citizen of a government at war with mexico can not on that account be regard as an intercourse by which assistance and succor be give to mexican rebel the whole current of mr. de|bocanegra 's remark run in the same direction as if the independence of texas have not be acknowledge have be acknowledge be acknowledge in against the remonstrance and protest of mexico and most of the act of any importance of which mr. de|bocanegra complain flow necessarily from that recognition speak of texas as still be an integral part of the territory of the|mexican|republic but can not but understand that the|united|state do not so regard the real complaint of mexico therefore be in substance neither more nor less than a complaint against the recognition of texan independence may be think rather late to repeat that complaint and not quite just to confine to the|united|state to the exemption of england france and belgium unless the|united|state have be the first to acknowledge the independence of mexico be to be blame for set an example for the recognition of that of texas and add the constitution public treaty and the law oblige the president to regard texas as an independent state and territory as no part of the territory of mexico texas have be an independent state with an organize government defy the power of mexico to overthrow or reconquer for more|than|ten|year before mexico commence the present war against the|united|state texas have give such evidence to the world of ability to maintain separate existence as an independent nation that have be formally recognize as such not only by the|united|state but by several of the principal power of europe these power have enter into treaty of amity commerce and navigation with have receive and accredit minister and other diplomatic agent at respective court and have commission minister and diplomatic agent on part to the government|of|texas if mexico notwithstanding all this and utter inability to subdue or reconquer texas still stubbornly refuse to recognize as an independent nation be none the less so on that account mexico have be recognize as an independent nation by the|united|state and by other power many|years before spain of which before revolution have be a colony would agree to recognize as such and yet mexico be at that time in the estimation of the civilized world and in fact none the less an independent power because spain still claim as a colony if spain have continue until the present period to assert that mexico be of colony in rebellion against this would not have make so or change the fact of independent existence texas at the period of annexation to the|united|state bear the same relation to mexico that mexico have bear to spain for many|years before spain acknowledge independence with this important difference that before the annexation of texas to the|united|state be consummate mexico by a formal act of government have acknowledge the independence of texas as a nation be true that in the act of recognition prescribe a condition which have no power or authority to impose that texas should not annex to any other power but this could not detract in any degree from the recognition which mexico then make of actual independence upon this plain statement of fact be absurd for mexico to allege as a pretext for commence hostility against the|united|state that texas be still a part of territory but there be those who concede all this to be true assume the ground that the true western boundary of texas be the nueces instead of and that therefore in march army to the east bank of the latter river pass the texan line and invade the territory of mexico a simple statement of fact know to exist will conclusively refute such an assumption texas as cede to the|united|state by france in have be always claim as extend west to the|rio|grande or rio|bravo this fact be establish by the authority of most eminent statesman at a period when the question be as well if not well understand than be at present during mr. jefferson 's administration messrs. monroe and pinckney who have be send on a special mission to madrid charge among other thing with the adjustment of boundary between the country in a note address to the spanish minister of foreign affair under date of the|28th|of|january,|1805 assert that the boundary of louisiana as cede to the|united|state by france be the river perdido on the east and the river bravo on the west and add that the fact and principle which justify this conclusion be so satisfactory to government as to convince that the|united|states have not a well right to the island of new|orleans under the cession refer to than have to the whole district of territory which be above describe down to the conclusion of the florida treaty in february,|1819 by which this territory be cede to spain the|united|state assert and maintain territorial right to this extent in during mr. monroe 's administration information have be receive that a number of foreign adventurer have land at galveston with the avowed purpose of form a settlement in that vicinity a special messenger be dispatch by with instruction from the secretary of state to warn to desist should be find there or any other place north of the rio bravo and within the territory claim by the|united|state be instruct should be find in the country north of that river to make known to the surprise with which the president have see possession thus take without authority from the|united|state of a place within territorial limit and upon which no lawful settlement can be make without sanction be instruct to call upon to avow under what national authority profess to act and to give due warning that the place be within the|united|state who will suffer no permanent settlement to be make there under any authority other than own as late as the 8th of july the secretary of state of the|united|state in a note address to minister in mexico maintain that by the florida treaty of the territory as far west as be confirm to spain in that note state by the treaty of the 22d of february between the|united|state and spain the sabine be adopt as the line of boundary between the power up to that period no considerable colonization have be effect in texas but the territory between the sabine and the|rio|grande be confirm to spain by the treaty application be make to that power for grant of land and such grant or permission of settlement be in fact make by the spanish authority in favor of citizen of the|united|state propose to emigrate to texas in numerous family before the declaration of independence by mexico the texas which be cede to spain by the florida treaty of embrace all the country now claim by the state of texas between the nueces and the|rio|grande the|republic|of|texas always claim this river as western boundary and in treaty make with santa|anna in may,|1836 recognize as such by the constitution which texas adopt in march,|1836 senatorial and representative district be organize extend west of the nueces the congress of texas on the|19th|of|december,|1836 pass an act to define the boundary of the|republic|of|texas in which declare the|rio|grande from mouth to source to be boundary and by the say act extend civil and political jurisdiction over the country up to that boundary during a period of more|than|nine|year which intervene between the adoption of constitution and annexation as of the states of union|texas assert and exercise many act of sovereignty and jurisdiction over the territory and inhabitant west of the nueces organize and define the limit of county extend to establish court of justice and extend judicial system over the territory establish a custom house and collect duty and also post - office and post - road in establish a land office and issue numerous grant for land within limit a senator and a representative residing in be elect to the|congress|of|the|republic and serve as such before the act of annexation take place in both the congress and convention of texas which give assent to the term of annexation to the|united|state propose by congress be representative reside west of the nueces who take part in the act of annexation this be the texas which by the act of congress of the 29th of december be admit as of the states of union that the congress of the|united|state understand the|state|of|texas which admit into the union to extend beyond the nueces be apparent from the fact that on the|31st|of|december,|1845 only|two|days after the act of admission pass a law to establish a collection district in the|state of texas by which create a port of delivery at corpus|christi situate west of the nueces and be the same point at which the texas custom house under the law of that republic have be locate and direct that a surveyor to collect the revenue should be appoint for that port by the president by and with the advice and consent of the senate a surveyor be accordingly nominate and confirm by the senate and have be ever since in the performance of duty all these act of the|republic|of|texas and of congress precede the order for the advance of army to the east bank of the|rio|grande subsequently congress pass an act establish certain post route extend west of the nueces the country west of that river now constitute a part of of the congressional district of texas and be represent in the|house|of|representatives the senators from that state be choose by a legislature in which the country west of that river be represent in view of all these fact be difficult to conceive upon what ground can be maintain that in occupy the country west of the nueces with army with a view solely to security and defense invade the territory of mexico but would have be still more difficult to justify the executive whose duty be to see that the law be faithfully execute if in the face of all these proceeding both of the congress of texas and of the|united|state have assume the responsibility of yield up the territory west of the nueces to mexico or of refuse to protect and defend this territory and inhabitant include corpus|christi as well as the remainder of texas against the threaten mexican invasion but mexico have never place the war which have wag upon the ground that army occupy the intermediate territory between the nueces and the|rio|grande refute pretension that texas be not in fact an independent state but a rebellious province be obstinately persevere in and avowed purpose in commence a war with the|united|state be to reconquer texas and to restore mexican authority over the whole territory not to the nueces only but to the sabine in view of the proclaim menace of mexico to this effect deem duty as a measure of precaution and defense to order army to occupy a position on frontier as a military post from which troop could good resist and repel any attempt invasion which mexico may make army have occupy a position at corpus|christi west of the nueces as|early|as|august,|1845 without complaint from any|quarter have the nueces be regard as the true western boundary of texas that boundary have be pass by army many|months before advance to the eastern bank of the|rio|grande in annual message of december last inform congress that upon the invitation of both the congress and convention of texas have deem proper to order a strong squadron to the coast of mexico and to concentrate an efficient military force on the western frontier of texas to protect and defend the inhabitant against the menaced invasion of mexico in that message inform congress that the moment the term of annexation offer by the|united|state be accept by texas the latter become so far a part of own country as to make duty to afford such protection and defense and that for that purpose squadron have be order to the gulf and army to take a position between the nueces and the|del|norte or rio|grande and to repel any invasion of the texan territory which may be attempt by the mexican force be deem proper to issue this order because soon after the president of texas in april,|1845 have issue proclamation convene the congress of that republic for the purpose of submit to that body the term of annexation propose by the|united|states|the|government|of|mexico make serious threat of invade the texan territory these threat become more imposing as become more apparent in the progress of the question that the people of texas would decide in favor of accept the term of annexation and finally have assume such a formidable character as induce both the congress and convention of texas to request that a military force should be send by the|united|state into territory for the purpose of protect and defend against the threaten invasion would have be a violation of good faith toward the people of texas to have refuse to afford the aid which desire against a threaten invasion to which have be expose by free determination to annex to union in compliance with the overture make to by the joint resolution of congress accordingly a portion of the army be order to advance into texas corpus|christi be the position select by general taylor encamp at that place in august,|1845 and the army remain in that position until the|11th|of|march,|1846 when move westward and on the|28th|of|that|month reach the east bank of the|rio|grande opposite to matamoras this movement be make in pursuance of order from issue on the|13th|of|january,|1846 before these order be issue the dispatch of minister in mexico transmit the decision of the council of government of mexico advise that should not be receive and also the dispatch of consul reside in the|city|of|mexico the former bearing date on the|17th and the latter on the|18th|of|december,|1845 copy of both of which accompany message to congress of the 11th of may last be receive at the|department|of|state these communication render highly probable if not absolutely certain that minister would not be receive by be also well know that but little hope could be entertain of a different result from general|parede in case the revolutionary movement which be prosecute should prove successful as be highly probable the partisan of paredes as minister in the dispatch refer to state breathe the fierce hostility against the|united|state denounce the propose negotiation as treason and openly call upon the troop and the people to put down the government of herrera by force the reconqu of texas and war with the|united|state be openly threaten these be the circumstance exist when be deem proper to order the army under the command of general taylor to advance to the western frontier of texas and occupy a position on or near the apprehension of a contemplate mexican invasion have be since fully justify by the event the determination of mexico to rush into hostility with the|united|state be afterwards manifest from the whole tenor of the note of the mexican minister of foreign affair to minister bear date on the|12th|of|march,|1846 parede have then revolutionize the government and minister after refer to the resolution for the annexation of texas which have be adopt by congress in march,|1845 proceed to declare a fact such as this or to speak with great exactness so notable an act of usurpation create an imperious necessity that mexico for own honor should repel with proper firmness and dignity have beforehand declare that would look upon such an act as a casus belli and as a consequence of this declaration negotiation be by very nature at an end and war be the only recourse of the|mexican|government appear also that on the 4th of april follow general|paredes through minister of war issue order to the mexican general in command on the texan frontier to attack army by every mean which war permit to this|general|parede have be pledge to the army and people of mexico during the military revolution which have bring into power on the|18th|of|april,|1846 general|parede address a letter to the commander on that frontier in which state to at the present date suppose at the head of that valiant army either fight already or prepare for the operation of a campaign and suppose already on the theater of operation and with all the force assemble be indispensable that hostility be commence take the initiative against the enemy the movement of army to be make by the commanding general under positive order to abstain from all aggressive act toward mexico or mexican citizen and to regard the relation between the country as peaceful unless mexico should declare war or commit act of hostility indicative of a state of war and these order faithfully execute whilst occupy position on the east bank of the|rio|grande within the limit of texas then recently admit as of the states of union the commanding general of the mexican force who in pursuance of the order of government have collect a large army on the opposite shore of the|rio|grande cross the river invade territory and commence hostility by attack force thus after all the injury which have receive and bear from mexico and after have insultingly reject a minister send to on a mission of peace and whom have solemnly agree to receive consummate long course of outrage against country by commence an offensive war and shed the blood of citizen on own soil the|united|state never attempt to acquire texas by conquest on the contrary at an early period after the people of texas have achieve independence seek to be annex to the|united|state at a general election in september,|1836 decide with great unanimity in favor of annexation and in november follow the|congress|of|the|republic authorize the appointment of a minister to bear request to this government this government however have remain neutral between texas and mexico during the war between and consider due to the honor of country and fair fame among the nation of the earth that should not at this early period consent to annexation nor until should be manifest to the whole world that the reconqu of texas by mexico be impossible refuse to accede to the overture make by texas on the|12th|of|april,|1844 after more|than|seven|year have elapse since texas have establish independence a treaty be conclude for the annexation of that republic to the|united|state which be reject by the senate finally on the|1st|of|march,|1845 congress pass a joint resolution for annex to the united|state upon certain preliminary condition to which assent be require the solemnity which characterize the deliberation and conduct of the government and people of texas on the deeply interesting question present by these resolution be know to the world the congress the executive and the people of texas in a convention elect for that purpose accept with great unanimity the propose term of annexation and thus consummate on part the great act of restore to federal|union a vast territory which have be cede to spain by the florida treaty more|than|a|quarter|of|a|century before after the joint resolution for the annexation of texas to the|united|state have be pass by congress the mexican minister at washington address a note to the secretary of state bear date on the|6th|of|march,|1845 protest against as an act of aggression the most unjust which can be find record in the annal of modern history namely that of despoil a friendly nation like mexico of a considerable portion of territory and protest against the resolution of annexation as be an act whereby the|province|of|texas an integral portion of the mexican territory be agree and admit into the|american|union and announce that as a consequence mission to the|united|state have terminate and demand passport which be grant be upon the absurd pretext make by mexico indebte for independence to a successful revolution that the|republic|of|texas still continue to be notwithstanding all that have pass a|province|of|mexico that this step be take by the mexican minister every honorable effort have be use by to avoid the war which follow but all have prove vain all attempt to preserve peace have be meet by insult and resistance on the part of mexico effort to this end commence in the note of the secretary of state of the|10th|of|march,|1845 in answer to that of the mexican minister whilst decline to reopen a discussion which have already be exhaust and prove again what be know to the whole world that texas have long since achieve independence the secretary of state express the regret of this government that mexico should have take offense at the resolution of annexation pass by congress and give assurance that most strenuous effort shall be devote to the amicable adjustment of every cause of complaint between the governments and to the cultivation of the kind and most friendly relation between the sister republics that have act in the spirit of this assurance will appear from the event which have since occur notwithstanding mexico have abruptly terminate all diplomatic intercourse with the|united|state and ought therefore to have be the first to ask for resumption yet waive all ceremony embrace the early favorable opportunity to ascertain from the|mexican|government whether would receive an envoy from the|united|state intrust with full power to adjust all the question in dispute between the government in september,|1845 believe the propitious moment for such an overture have arrive texas by the enthusiastic and almost unanimous will of people have pronounce in favor of annexation mexico have agree to acknowledge the independence of texas subject to a condition be true which have no right to impose and no power to enforce the last linger hope of mexico if still could have retain any that texas would ever again become of provinces must have be abandon the consul of the|united|state at the|city|of|mexico be therefore instruct by the secretary of state on the|15th|of|september,|1845 to make the inquiry of the|mexican|government the inquiry be make and on the|15th|of|october,|1845 the minister of foreign affair of the|mexican|government in a note address to consul give a favorable response request at the same time that naval force may be withdraw from while negotiation should be pende upon the receipt of this note naval force be promptly withdraw from vera|cruz a minister be immediately appoint and depart to mexico everything bear a promising aspect for a speedy and peaceful adjustment of all difficulty at the date of annual message to congress in december last no doubt be entertain but that would be receive by the|mexican|government and the hope be cherish that all cause of misunderstanding between the country would be speedily remove in the confident hope that such would be the result of mission inform congress that forbore at that time to recommend such ulterior measure of redress for the wrong and injury have so long bear as would have be proper to make have no such negotiation be institute to surprise and regret the|mexican|government though solemnly pledge to do so upon the arrival of minister in mexico refuse to receive and accredit when reach vera|cruz on the|30th|of|november,|1845 find that the aspect of affair have undergo an unhappy change the government of general herrera who be at that time president of the republic be totter to fall general|parede a military leader have manifest determination to overthrow the government of herrera by a military revolution and of the principal mean which employ to effect purpose and render the government of herrera odious to the army and people of mexico be by loudly condemn determination to receive a minister of peace from the|united|state allege that be the intention of herrera by a treaty with the|united|state to dismember the territory of mexico by cede away the department of texas the|government|of|herrera be believe to have be well disposed to a pacific adjustment of exist difficulty but probably alarmed for own security and in order to ward off the danger of the revolution lead by paredes violate solemn agreement and refuse to receive or accredit minister and this although inform that have be invest with full power to adjust all question in dispute between the government among the frivolous pretext for this refusal the principal be that minister have not go upon a special mission confine to the question of texas alone leave all the outrage upon flag and citizen unredresse the|mexican|government well know that both national honor and the protection due to citizen imperatively require that the question of boundary and indemnity should be treat of together as naturally and inseparably blend and ought to have see that this course be best calculate to enable the|united|state to extend to the most liberal justice on the|30th|of|december,|1845 general herrera resign the presidency and yield up the government to general|parede without a struggle thus a revolution be accomplish solely by the army command by paredes and the supreme power in mexico pass into the hand of a military usurper who be know to be bitterly hostile to the|united|state although the prospect of a pacific adjustment with the new government be unpromising from the known hostility of head to the|united|state yet determine that nothing should be leave undone on part to restore friendly relation between the country minister be instruct to present credential to the new government and ask to be accredit by in the diplomatic character in which have be commission these instruction execute by note of the|1st|of|march,|1846 address to the mexican minister of foreign affair but request be insultingly refuse by that minister in answer of the 12th of the|same|month no alternative remain for minister but to demand passport and return to the|united|state thus be the extraordinary spectacle present to the civilized world of a government in violation of own express agreement have twice reject a minister of peace invest with full power to adjust all the exist difference between the country in a manner just and honorable to both be not aware that modern history present a parallel case in which in time of peace nation have refuse even to hear proposition from another for terminate exist difficulty between scarcely a hope of adjust difficulty even at a|remote|day or of preserve peace with mexico could be cherish while paredes remain at the head of the government have acquire the supreme power by a military revolution and upon the most solemn pledge to wage war against the|united|state and to reconquer texas which claim as a revolt province of mexico have denounce as guilty of treason all those mexicans who consider texas as no longer constitute a part of the territory of mexico and who be friendly to the cause of peace the duration of the war which wag against the|united|state be indefinite because the end which propose of the reconqu of texas be hopeless besides there be good reason to believe from all conduct that be intention to convert the|republic|of|mexico into a monarchy and to call a foreign european prince to the throne preparatory to this end have during short rule destroy the liberty of the press tolerate that portion of only which openly advocate the establishment of a monarchy the well to secure the success of ultimate design have by an arbitrary decree convoke a congress not to be elect by the free voice of the people but to be choose in a manner to make subservient to will and to give absolute control over deliberation under all these circumstance be believe that any revolution in mexico found upon opposition to the ambitious project of paredes would tend to promote the cause of peace as well as prevent any attempt european interference in the affair of the north|american continent both object of deep interest to the|united|state any such foreign interference if attempt must have be resist by the|united|state view upon that subject be fully communicate to congress in last annual message in any event be certain that no change whatever in the|government|of|mexico which would deprive parede of power could be for the bad so far as the|united|state be concern while be highly probable that any change must be for the well this be the state of affair exist when congress on the|13th|of|may|last recognize the existence of the war which have be commence by the|government|of|parede and become an object of much importance with a view to a speedy settlement of difficulty and the restoration of an honorable peace that paredes should not retain power in mexico before that time there be symptom of a revolution in mexico favor as be understand to be by the more liberal party and especially by those who be oppose to foreign interference and to the monarchical form of government santa|anna be then in exile in havana have be expel from power and banish from country by a revolution which occur in december,|1844 but be know that have still a considerable party in favor in mexico be also equally well know that no vigilance which could be exert by squadron would in all probability have prevent from effect a landing somewhere on the extensive gulf coast of mexico if desire to return to country have openly profess an entire change of policy have express regret that have subvert the federal constitution of and avow that be now in favor of restoration have publicly declare hostility in strong term to the establishment of a monarchy and to european interference in the affair of country information to this effect have be receive from source believe to be reliable at the date of the recognition of the existence of the war by congress and be afterwards fully confirm by the receipt of the dispatch of consul in the|city|of|mexico with the accompany document which be herewith transmit besides be reasonable to suppose that must see the ruinous consequence to mexico of a war with the|united|state and that would be interest to favor peace be under these circumstance and upon these consideration that be deem expedient not to obstruct return to mexico should attempt to do so object be the restoration of peace and with that view no reason be perceive why should take part with paredes and aid by mean of blockade in prevent the return of rival to mexico on the contrary be believe that the intestine division which ordinary sagacity could not but anticipate as the fruit of santa|anna 's return to mexico and contest with paredes may strongly tend to produce a disposition with both party to restore and preserve peace with the|united|state parede be a soldier by profession and a monarchist in principle have but recently before be successful in a military revolution by which have obtain power be the swear enemy of the|united|state with which have involve country in the exist war santa|anna have be expel from power by the army be know to be in open hostility to paredes and publicly pledge against foreign intervention and the restoration of monarchy in mexico in view of these fact and circumstance be that when order be issue to the commander of naval force in the gulf on the same day on which the existence of the war be recognize by congress to place the coast of mexico under blockade be direct not to obstruct the passage of santa|anna to mexico should attempt to return a revolution take place in mexico in the early part of august following by which the power of paredes be overthrow and have since be banish from the country and be now in exile shortly afterwards santa|anna return remain to be see whether return may not yet prove to be favorable to a pacific adjustment of the exist difficulty be manifestly interest not to persevere in the prosecution of a war commence by paredes to accomplish a purpose so absurd as the reconqu of texas to the sabine have paredes remain in power be morally certain that any pacific adjustment would have be hopeless upon the commencement of hostility by mexico against the|united|state the indignant spirit of the nation be at once arouse congress promptly respond to the expectation of the country and by recognize the fact that war exist by the act of mexico between the|united|state and that republic and grant the mean necessary for vigorous prosecution be involve in a war thus commence by mexico and for the justice of which on part may confidently appeal to the whole world resolve to prosecute with the utmost vigor accordingly the port of mexico on the gulf and on the pacific have be place under blockade and territory invade at several important point the report from the departments of war and of the navy will inform more in detail of the measure adopt in the emergency in which country be place and of the gratifying result which have be accomplish the various column of the army have perform duty under great disadvantage with the most distinguished skill and courage the victory of palo|alto and resaca|de|la|palma and of monterey win against greatly superior number and against most decided advantage in other respect on the part of the enemy be brilliant in execution and entitle brave officer and soldier to the grateful thank of country the nation deplore the loss of the brave officer and man who have gallantly fall while vindicate and defend country 's right and honor be a subject of pride and satisfaction that volunteer citizen soldier who so promptly respond to country 's call with an experience of the discipline of a camp of only|a|few|week have bear part in the hard fight battle of monterey with a constancy and courage equal to that of veteran troop and worthy of the high admiration the privation of long march through the enemy 's country and through a wilderness have be bear without a murmur by rapid movement the|province|of|new|mexico with santa|fe capital have be capture without bloodshed the navy have cooperate with the army and render important service if not so brilliant be because the enemy have no force to meet on own element and because of the defense which nature have interpose in the difficulty of the navigation on the mexican coast squadron in the pacific with the cooperation of a gallant officer of the army and a small force hastily collect in that distant country have acquire bloodless possession of the californias and the american flag have be raise at every important point in that province congratulate on the success which have thus attend military and naval operation in less|than|seven|month after mexico commence hostility at a time select by have take possession of many of principal port drive back and pursue invade army and acquire military possession of the|mexican|provinces|of|new|mexico new|leon coahuila tamaulipas and the californias a territory large in extent than that embrace in the original thirteen|state of the union inhabit by a considerable population and much of more|than|1,000|mile from the point at which have to collect force and commence movement by the blockade the import and export trade of the enemy have be cut off well may the american people be proud of the energy and gallantry of regular and volunteer officer and soldier the event of these|few|month afford a gratify proof that country can under any emergency confidently rely for the maintenance of honor and the defense of right on an effective force ready at all time voluntarily to relinquish the comfort of home for the peril and privation of the camp and though such a force may be for the time expensive be in the end economical as the ability to command remove the necessity of employ a large standing army in time of peace and prove that people love institution and be ever ready to defend and protect while the war be in a course of vigorous and successful prosecution be still anxious to arrest evil and consider that after the brilliant victory of arm on last the national honor could not be compromitte by another overture be make to mexico by direction on last to terminate hostility by a peace just and honorable to both country on the|31st|of|august follow the|mexican|government decline to accept this friendly overture but refer to the decision of a mexican congress to be assemble in the early part of the|present|month communicate to herewith a copy of the letter of the secretary of state propose to reopen negotiation of the answer of the|mexican|government and of the reply thereto of the secretary of state the war will continue to be prosecute with vigor as the good mean of secure peace be hope that the decision of the|mexican|congress to which last overture have be refer may result in a speedy and honorable peace with experience however of the unreasonable course of the mexican authority be the part of wisdom not to relax in the energy of military operation until the result be make known in this view be deem important to hold military possession of all the provinces which have be take until a definitive treaty of peace shall have be conclude and ratify by the country the war have not be wag with a view to conquest but have be commence by mexico have be carry into the enemy 's country and will be vigorously prosecute there with a view to obtain an honorable peace and thereby secure ample indemnity for the expense of the war as well as to much injure citizen who hold large pecuniary demand against mexico by the law of nation a conquered country be subject to be govern by the conqueror during military possession and until there be either a treaty of peace or shall voluntarily withdraw from the old civil government be necessarily supersede be the right and duty of the conqueror to secure conquest and to provide for the maintenance of civil order and the right of the inhabitant this right have be exercise and this duty perform by military and naval commander by the establishment of temporary government in some of the conquer provinces|of|mexico assimilate as far as practicable to the free institution of own country in the provinces of new mexico and of the californias little if any further resistance be apprehend from the inhabitant to the temporary government which have thus from the necessity of the case and accord to the law of war be establish may be proper to provide for the security of these important conquest by make an adequate appropriation for the purpose of erect fortification and defray the expense necessarily incident to the maintenance of possession and authority over near the close of last session for reason communicate to congress deem important as a measure for secure a speedy peace with mexico that a sum of money should be appropriate and place in the power of the executive similar to that which have be make upon former occasion during the administration of president jefferson on the|26th|of|february,|1803 an appropriation of be make and place at the disposal of the president object be well know be at that time in contemplation to acquire louisiana from france and be intend to be apply as a part of the consideration which may be pay for that territory on the|13th|of|february,|1806 the same sum be in like manner appropriate with a view to the purchase of the floridas from spain these appropriation be make to facilitate negotiation and as a means to enable the president to accomplish the important object in view though do not become necessary for the president to use these appropriation yet a state of thing may have arise in which would have be highly important for to do so and the wisdom of make can not be doubt be believe that the measure recommend at last session meet with the approbation of decided majority in both houses|of|congress indeed in different form a bill make an appropriation of pass each house and be much to be regret that do not become a law the reason which induce to recommend the measure at that time still exist and again submit the subject for consideration and suggest the importance of early action upon should the appropriation be make and be not need will remain in the treasury should be deem proper to apply in whole or in part will be account for as other public expenditure immediately after congress have recognize the existence of the war with mexico attention be direct to the danger that privateer may be fit out in the port of cuba and porto|rico to prey upon the commerce of the|united|state and invite the special attention of the|spanish|government to the fourteenth article of treaty with that power of the|27th|of|october,|1795 under which the citizen and subject of either nation who shall take commission or letter of marque to act as privateer against the other shall be punish as pirate afford pleasure to inform that have receive assurance from the|spanish|government that this article of the treaty shall be faithfully observe on part order for this purpose be immediately transmit from that government to the authority of cuba and porto|rico to exert utmost vigilance in prevent any attempt to fit out privateer in those island against the|united|state from the good faith of spain be fully satisfied that this treaty will be execute in spirit as well as letter whilst the|united|state will on part faithfully perform all the obligation which impose on information have be recently receive at the|department|of|state that the|mexican|government have send to havana blank commission to privateer and blank certificate of naturalization sign by general salas the present head of the|mexican|government there be also reason to apprehend that similar document have be transmit to other part of the world copy of these paper in translation be herewith transmit as the preliminary require by the practice of civilized nation for commission privateer and regulate conduct appear not to have be observe and as these commission be in blank to be fill up with the name of citizen and subject of all nation who may be willing to purchase the whole proceeding can only be construe as an invitation to all the freebooter upon earth who be willing to pay for the privilege to cruise against american commerce will be for court of justice to decide whether under such circumstance these mexican letter of marque and reprisal shall protect those who accept and commit robbery upon the high sea under authority from the pain and penalty of piracy if the certificate of naturalization thus grant be intend by mexico to shield spanish subject from the guilt and punishment of pirate under treaty with spain will certainly prove unavaile such a subterfuge would be but a weak device to defeat the provision of a solemn treaty recommend that congress should immediately provide by law for the trial and punishment as pirate of spanish subject who escape the vigilance of government shall be find guilty of privateering against the|united|state do not apprehend serious danger from these privateer navy will be constantly on the alert to protect commerce besides in case prize should be make of american vessel the utmost vigilance will be exert by blockading squadron to prevent the captor from take into mexican port and be not apprehend that any nation will violate neutrality by suffer such prize to be condemn and sell within jurisdiction recommend that congress should immediately provide by law for grant letter of marque and reprisal against vessel under the mexican flag be true that there be but few if any commercial vessel of mexico upon the high sea and be therefore not probable that many american privateer would be fit out in case a law should pass authorize this mode of warfare be notwithstanding certain that such privateer may render good service to the commercial interest of the country by recapture merchant ship should any be take by armed vessel under the mexican flag as well as by capture these vessel every mean within power should be render available for the protection of commerce the annual report of the secretary of the treasury will exhibit a detailed statement of the condition of the finance the import for the|fiscal|year|ending|on|the|30th|of|june|last be of the value of of which the amount export be leave the amount retain in the country for domestic consumption the value of the export for the same period be of which consist of domestic production and of foreign article the receipt into the treasury for the|same|year be of which there be derive from custom from the sale of public land and from incidental and miscellaneous source 92,126.71 the expenditure for the same period be and the balance in the treasury on the|1st|day|of|july|last be the amount of the public debt include treasury note on the|1st|of|the|present|month be of which the sum of be outstanding on the|4th|of|march,|1845 leave the amount incur since that time in order to prosecute the war with mexico with vigor and energy as the good mean of bring to a speedy and honorable termination a further loan will be necessary to meet the expenditure for the present and the|next|fiscal|year if the war should be continue until the|30th|of|june,|1848 be the|end|of|the|next|fiscal|year be estimate that an additional loan of will be require this estimate be make upon the assumption that will be necessary to retain constantly in the treasury to guard against contingency if such surplus be not require to be retain then a loan of would be sufficient if however congress should at the present session impose a revenue duty on the principal article now embrace in the free list be estimate that an additional annual revenue of about|two|millions|and|a|half amount be estimate on the|30th|of|june,|1848 to would be derive from that source and the loan require would be reduce by that amount be estimate also that should congress graduate and reduce the price of such of the public land as have be long in the market the additional revenue derive from that source would be annually for several|year to come between|half|a|million and a dollar and the loan require may be reduce by that amount also should these measure be adopt the loan require would not probably exceed or leave in the treasury a constant surplus of the loan propose be estimate will be sufficient to cover the necessary expenditure both for the war and for all other purpose up to the|30th|of|june,|1848 and an amount of this loan not exceed half may be require during the|present|fiscal|year and the great part of the remainder during the|first|half|of|the|fiscal|year succeeding in order that timely notice may be give and proper measure take to effect the loan or such portion of as may be require be important that the authority of congress to make be give at an early period of present session be suggest that the loan should be contract for a period of twenty|years with authority to purchase the stock and pay off at an early period at market value out of any surplus which may at any time be in the treasury applicable to that purpose after the establishment of peace with mexico be suppose that a considerable surplus will exist and that the debt may be extinguish in a much short period than that for which may be contract the period of twenty|years as that for which the propose loan may be contract in preference to a short period be suggest because all experience both at home and abroad have show that loan be effect upon much well term upon long time than when be reimbursable at short date necessary as this measure be to sustain the honor and the interest of the country engage in a foreign war be not doubt but that congress will promptly authorize the balance in the treasury on the|1st|july last exceed notwithstanding considerable expenditure have be make for the war during the|months|of|may and june precede but for the war the whole public debt could and would have be extinguish within a short period and be a part of settle policy to do so and thus relieve the people from burden and place the government in a position which would enable to reduce the public expenditure to that economical standard which be most consistent with the general welfare and the pure and wholesome progress of institution among just cause of complaint against mexico arise out of refusal to treat for peace as well before as since the war so unjustly commence on part be the extraordinary expenditure in which have be involve justice to own people will make proper that mexico should be hold responsible for these expenditure economy in the public expenditure be at all time a high duty which all public functionary of the government owe to the people this duty become the more imperative in a period of war when large and extraordinary expenditure become unavoidable during the existence of the war with mexico all resource should be husbanded and no appropriation make except such as be absolutely necessary for vigorous prosecution and the due administration of the government object of appropriation which in peace may be deem useful or proper but which be not indispensable for the public service may when the country be engage in a foreign war be well postpone to a future period by the observance of this policy at present session large amount may be save to the treasury and be apply to object of press and urgent necessity and thus the creation of a corresponding amount of public debt may be avoid be not mean to recommend that the ordinary and necessary appropriation for the support of government should be withhold but be well know that at every session of congress appropriation be propose for numerous object which may or may not be make without materially affect the public interest and these be recommend should not be grant the act pass at last session reduce the duty on import not have go into operation until the|1st|of|the|present|month there have not be time for practical effect upon the revenue and the business of the country to be develop be not doubt however that the just policy which adopt will add largely to foreign trade and promote the general prosperity although can not be certainly foresee what amount of revenue will yield be estimate that will exceed that produce by the|act|of|1842 which supersede the lead principle establish by be to levy the taxis with a view to raise revenue and to impose upon the article import accord to actual value the|act|of|1842 by the excessive rate of duty which impose on many article either totally exclude from importation or greatly reduce the amount import and thus diminish instead of produce revenue by the taxis be impose not for the legitimate purpose of raise revenue but to afford advantage to favor class at the expense of a large majority of fellow citizen those employ in agriculture mechanical pursuit commerce and navigation be compel to contribute from substance to swell the profit and overgrown wealth of the comparatively few who have invest capital in manufacture the taxis be not levy in proportion to the value of the article upon which be impose but widely depart from this just rule the light taxis be in many case levy upon article of luxury and high price and the heavy taxis on those of necessity and low price consume by the great mass of the people be a system the inevitable effect of which be to relieve favor class and the wealthy few from contribute just proportion for the support of government and to lay the burden on the labor of the many engage in other pursuit than manufacture a system so unequal and unjust have be supersede by the exist law which impose duty not for the benefit or injury of class or pursuit but distribute and as far as practicable equalize the public burden among all class and occupation the favor class who under the unequal and unjust system which have be repeal have heretofore realize large profit and many of amass large fortune at the expense of the many who have be make tributary to will have no reason to complain if shall be require to bear just proportion of the taxis necessary for the support of government so far from will be perceive by an examination of the exist law that discrimination in the rate of duty impose within the revenue principle have be retain in favor the incidental aid against foreign competition which still enjoy give an advantage which no other pursuit possess but of this none other will complain because the duty levy be necessary for revenue these revenue duty include freight and charge which the importer must pay before can come in competition with the home manufacturer in market amount on nearly all lead branch of manufacture to third of the value of the import article and in some case to almost|one half value with such advantage be not doubt that domestic manufacturer will continue to prosper realize in well conduct establishment even great profit than can be derive from any other regular business indeed so far from require the protection of even incidental revenue duty manufacturer in several lead branch be extend business give evidence of great ingenuity and skill and of ability to compete with increase prospect of success for the open market of the world domestic manufacture to the value of several|millions|of|dollar which can not find a market at home be annually export to foreign country with such rate of duty as those establish by the exist law the system will probably be permanent and capitalist who be make or shall hereafter make investment in manufacture will know upon what to rely the country will be satisfied with these rate because the advantage which the manufacturer still enjoy result necessarily from the collection of revenue for the support of government high protective duty from unjust operation upon the masse of the people can not fail to give rise to extensive dissatisfaction and complaint and to constant effort to change or repeal render all investment in manufacture uncertain and precarious low and more permanent rate of duty at the same time that will yield to the manufacturer fair and remunerating profit will secure against the danger of frequent change in the system which can not fail to ruinously affect interest simultaneously with the relaxation of the restrictive policy by the|united|state great|britain from whose example derive the system have relax her have modify corn law and reduce many other duty to moderate revenue rate after age of experience the statesman of that country have be constrain by a stern necessity and by a public opinion have deep foundation in the suffering and want of impoverished million to abandon a system the effect of which be to build up immense fortune in the hand of the few and to reduce the labor million to pauperism and misery nearly in the same ratio that labor be depress capital be increase and concentrate by the british protective policy the evil of the system in great|britain be at length render intolerable and have be abandon but not without a severe struggle on the part of the protect and favor class to retain the unjust advantage which have so long enjoy be to be expect that a similar struggle would be make by the same class in the|united|state whenever an attempt be make to modify or abolish the same unjust system here the protective policy have be in operation in the|united|state for a much short period and pernicious effect be not therefore so clearly perceive and feel enough however be know of these effect to induce repeal would be strange if in the face of the example of great|britain principal foreign customer and of the evil of a system render manifest in that country by long and painful experience and in the face of the immense advantage which under a more liberal commercial policy be already derive and must continue to derive by supply starve population with food the|united|states should restore a policy which have be compel to abandon and thus diminish ability to purchase from the food and other article which so much need and so much desire to sell by the simultaneous abandonment of the protective policy by great|britain and the|united|stat new and important market have already be open for agricultural and other product commerce and navigation have receive a new impulse labor and trade have be release from the artificial trammel which have so long fetter and to a great extent reciprocity in the exchange of commodity have be introduce at the same time by both country and greatly for the benefit of both great|britain have be force by the pressure of circumstance at home to abandon a policy which have be uphold for age and to open market for immense surplus of breadstuff and be confidently believe that other power of europe will ultimately see the wisdom if be not compel by the pauperism and suffering of crowded population to pursue a similar policy farmer be more deeply interested in maintain the just and liberal policy of the exist law than any other class of citizen constitute a large majority of population and be well know that when prosper all other pursuit prosper also have heretofore not only receive none of the bounty or favor of government but by the unequal operation of the protective policy have be make by the burden of taxation which impose to contribute to the bounty which have enrich other when a foreign as well as a home market be open to must receive as be now receive increase price for product will find a ready sale and at well price for wheat flour rice indian corn beef pork lard butter cheese and other article which produce the home market alone be inadequate to enable to dispose of the immense surplus of food and other article which be capable of produce even at the most reduced price for the manifest reason that can not be consume in the country the|united|state can from immense surplus supply not only the home demand but the deficiency of food require by the whole world that the reduce production of some of the chief article of food in great|britain and other part of europe may have contribute to increase the demand for breadstuff and provision be not doubt but that the great and efficient cause of this increase demand and of increase price consist in the removal of artificial restriction heretofore impose be deem to be equally certain that export of food already increase and increase beyond former example under the more liberal policy which have be adopt will be still vastly enlarge unless be check or prevent by a restoration of the protective policy can not be doubt that commercial and navigating interest will be enlarge in a corresponding ratio with the increase of trade be equally certain while manufacture interest will still be the favor interest of the country and receive the incidental protection afford by revenue duty and more than this can not justly demand in annual message of december last a tariff of revenue duty base upon the principle of the exist law be recommend and have see no reason to change the opinion then express in view of the probable beneficial effect of that law recommend that the policy establish by be maintain have but just commence to operate and to abandon or modify without give a fair trial would be inexpedient and unwise should defect in any of detail be ascertain by actual experience to exist these may be hereafter correct but until such defect shall become manifest the act should be fairly test be submit for consideration whether may not be proper as a war measure to impose revenue duty on some of the article now embrace in the free list should be deem proper to impose such duty with a view to raise revenue to meet the expense of the war with mexico or to avoid to that extent the creation of a public debt may be repeal when the emergency which give rise to shall cease to exist and constitute no part of the permanent policy of the country the act of the 6th of august last to provide for the well organization of the treasury and for the collection safe keeping transfer and disbursement of the public revenue have be carry into execution as rapidly as the delay necessarily arise out of the appointment of new officer take and approve bond and prepare and secure proper place for the safe keeping of the public money would permit be not propose to depart in any respect from the principle or policy on which this great measure be round there be however defect in the detail of the measure develop by practical operation which be fully set forth in the report of the secretary of the treasury to which the attention of congress be invite these defect would impair to some extent the successful operation of the law at all time but be especially embarrassing when the country be engage in a war when the expenditure be greatly increase when loan be to be effect and the disbursement be to be make at point many|hundred|miles distant in some case from any depository and a large portion of in a foreign country the modification suggest in the report of the secretary of the treasury be recommend to favorable consideration in connection with this subject invite attention to the importance of establish a branch of the mint of the|united|state at new|york third of the revenue derive from custom be collect at that point the demand for specie to pay the duty will be large and a branch mint where foreign coin and bullion could be immediately convert into american coin would greatly facilitate the transaction of the public business enlarge the circulation of gold and silver and be at the same time a safe depository of the public money the importance of graduate and reduce the price of such of the public land as have be long offer in the market at the minimum rate authorize by exist law and remain unsold induce again to recommend the subject to favorable consideration many|millions|of|acre of these land have be offer in the market for more|than|thirty|year and large quantity for more|than|ten|or|twenty|year and be of an inferior quality must remain unsalable for an indefinite period unless the price at which may be purchase shall be reduce to place a price upon above real value be not only to prevent sale and thereby deprive the treasury of any income from that source but be unjust to the states in which lie because retard growth and increase of population and because have no power to levy a tax upon as upon other land within limit hold by other proprietor than the|united|state for the support of local government the beneficial effect of the graduation principle have be realize by some of the states own the land within limit in which have be adopt have be demonstrate also by the|united|state act as the trustee of the chickasaw tribe of indians in the sale of land lie within the|states|of|mississippi and alabama the chickasaw land which would not command in the market the minimum price establish by the law of the|united|state for the sale of land be in pursuance of the|treaty|of|1834 with that tribe subsequently offer for sale at graduate and reduce rate for limited period the result be that large quantity of these land be purchase which would otherwise have remain unsold the land be dispose of at real value and many person of limited mean be enable to purchase small tract upon which have settle with family that similar result would be produce by the adoption of the graduation policy by the|united|state in all the states in which be the owner of large body of land which have be long in the market can not be doubt can not be a sound policy to withhold large quantity of the public land from the use and occupation of citizen by fix upon price which experience have show will not command on the contrary be a wise policy to afford facility to citizen to become the owner at low and moderate rate of freehold of own instead of be the tenant and dependent of other if be apprehend that these land if reduce in price would be secure in large quantity by speculator or capitalist the sale may be restrict in limited quantity to actual settler or person purchase for purpose of cultivation in last annual message submit for the consideration of congress the present system of manage the mineral land of the|united|state and recommend that should be bring into market and sell upon such term and under such restriction as congress may prescribe by the act of the|11th|of|july last the reserve lead mine and contiguous land in the|state of illinois and arkansas and territories|of|wisconsin and iowa be authorize to be sell the act be confine in operation to lead mine and contiguous land a large portion of the public land contain copper and other ore be represent to be very valuable and recommend that provision be make authorize the sale of these land upon such term and condition as from suppose value may in the judgment of congress be deem advisable have due regard to the interest of such of citizen as may be locate upon will be important during present session to establish a territorial government and to extend the jurisdiction and law of the|united|state over oregon law regulate trade and intercourse with the indian tribe east of the|rocky|mountain should be extend to and for the purpose of execute and preserve friendly relation with the indian tribe within limit an additional number of indian agency will be require and should be authorize by law the establishment of custom house and of post - office and post - road and provision for the transportation of the mail on such route as the public convenience will suggest require legislative authority will be proper also to establish a surveyor general 's office in that territory and to make the necessary provision for survey the public land and bring into market as citizen who now reside in that distant region have be subject to many hardship privation and sacrifice in emigration and by improvement have enhance the value of the public land in the neighborhood of settlement be recommend that liberal grant be make to ot such portion of these land as may occupy and that similar grant or right of preemption be make to all who may emigrate thither within a limited period prescribe by law the report of the secretary of war contain detailed information relative to the several branch of the public service connect with that department the operation of the army have be of a satisfactory and highly gratifying character recommend to early and favorable consideration the measure propose by the secretary of war for speedily fill up the rank and file of the|regular|army for great efficiency in the field and for raise an additional force to serve during the war with mexico embarrassment be likely to arise for want of legal provision authorize compensation to be make to the agent employ in the several states and territories to pay the revolutionary and other pensioner the amount allow by law attention be invite to the recommendation of the secretary of war on this subject these agent incur heavy responsibility and perform important duty and no reason exist why should not be place on the same footing as to compensation with other disburse officer relation with the various indian tribe continue to be of a pacific character the unhappy dissension which have exist among the cherokees for many|years past have be heal since last|annual message important treaty have be negotiate with some of the tribe by which the indian title to large tract of valuable land within the limit of the states and territories have be extinguish and arrangement make for remove to the country west of the mississippi between|3,000|and|4,000 of different tribe have be remove to the country provide for by treaty stipulation and arrangement have be make for other to follow in intercourse with the several tribe particular attention have be give to the important subject of education the number of school establish among have be increase and additional mean provide not only for teach the rudiment of education but of instruct in agriculture and the mechanic art refer to the report of the secretary of the navy for a satisfactory view of the operation of the department under charge during the|past|year be gratify to perceive that while the war with mexico have render necessary to employ an unusual number of armed vessel on coast the protection due to commerce in other quarter of the world have not prove insufficient no mean will be spare to give efficiency to the naval service in the prosecution of the war and be happy to know that the officer and man anxiously desire to devote to the service of country in any enterprise however difficult of execution recommend to favorable consideration the proposition to add to each of foreign squadron an efficient sea steamer and as especially demand attention the establishment at pensacola of the necessary mean of repair and refit the vessel of the navy employ in there be other suggestion in the report which deserve and doubt not will receive consideration the progress and condition of the mail service for the|past|year be fully present in the report of the|postmaster general the revenue for the|year|ending|on|the|30th|of|june|last amount to which be less than that of the|preceding|year the payment for that department during the same time amount to of this sum have be draw from the treasury the disbursement for the|year be less than those of the|preceding|year while the disbursement have be thus diminish the mail facility have be enlarge by new mail route of an increase of transportation of 1,764,145|mile and the establishment of new post - office contractor postmaster and other engage in this branch of the service have perform duty with energy and faithfulness deserve commendation for many interesting detail connect with the operation of this establishment be refer to the report of the|postmaster general and suggestion for improve revenue be recommend to favorable consideration repeat the opinion express in last annual message that the business of this department should be so regulated that the revenue derive from should be make to equal the expenditure and be believe that this may be do by proper modification of the present law as suggest in the report of the|postmaster general without change the present rate of postage with full reliance upon the wisdom and patriotism of deliberation will be duty as will be anxious desire to cooperate with in every constitutional effort to promote the welfare and maintain the honor of common country transcript to the senate and house|of|representatif of the|united|state invite attention to the propriety of make an appropriation to provide for any expenditure which may be necessary to make in advance for the purpose of settle all difficulty with the|mexican|republic be sincere desire to terminate as be originally to avoid the exist war with mexico by a peace just and honorable to both party be probable that the chief obstacle to be surmount in accomplish this desirable object will be the adjustment of a boundary between the republics which shall prove satisfactory and convenient to both and such as neither will hereafter be incline to disturb in the adjustment of this boundary ought to pay a fair equivalent for any concession which may be make by mexico under these circumstance and consider the other complicated question to be settle by negotiation with the|mexican|republic deem important that a sum of money should be place under the control of the executive to be advanced if nee be to the government of that republic immediately after ratification of a treaty may be inconvenient for the|mexican|government to wait for the whole sum the payment of which may be stipulate by this treaty until could be ratify by senate and an appropriation to carry into effect make by congress indeed the necessity for this delay may defeat the object altogether the disbursement of this money would of course be account for not as secret service money but like other expenditure precedent for such a proceeding exist in past history during the administration of mr. jefferson to which would call attention on the|26th|february,|1803 an act be pass appropriate for the purpose of defray any extraordinary expense which may be incur in the intercourse between the|united|state and foreign nation to be apply under the direction of the president of the|united|state who shall cause an account of the expenditure thereof to be lay before congress as soon as may be and on the|13th|of|february,|1806 an appropriation be make of the same amount and in the same term in neither case be the money actually draw from the treasury and should hope that the result in this respect may be similar on the present occasion although the appropriation may prove to be indispensable in accomplish the object would therefore recommend the passage of a law appropriate to be place at the disposal of the executive for the purpose which have indicate in order to prevent all misapprehension be duty to state that anxious as be to terminate the exist war with the least possible delay will continue to be prosecute with the utmost vigor until a treaty of peace shall be sign by the party and ratify by transcript to the senate of the|united|state transmit herewith for the consideration and constitutional action of the senate article of a treaty which have be conclude by the commissioner appoint for the purpose with the different party into which the cherokee tribe of indians have be divide through delegate now in washington the same commissioner have previously be appoint to investigate the subject of the difficulty which have for year exist among the cherokees and which have keep in a state of constant excitement and almost entirely interrupt all progress on part in civilization and improvement in agriculture and the mechanic art and have lead to many unfortunate act of domestic strife against which the government be bind by the treaty of to protect unfortunate internal dissension have attract the notice and excite the sympathy of the whole country and become evident that if something be not do to heal would terminate in a sanguinary war in which other tribe of indians may become involved and the life and property of own citizen on the frontier endanger recommend in message to congress on the|13th|of|april last such measure as then think expedient should be adopt to restore peace and good order among the cherokees of which be a division of the country which occupy and separation of the tribe this recommendation be make under the belief that the different faction could not be reconcile and live together in harmony a belief base in a great degree upon the representation of the delegate of the division of the tribe since then however there appear to have be a change of opinion on this subject on the part of these division of the tribe and on representation be make to that by the appointment of commissioner to hear and investigate the cause of grievance of the party against each other and to examine into claim against the government would probably be find that an arrangement could be make which would once more harmonize the tribe and adjust in a satisfactory manner claim upon and relation with the|united|state do not hesitate to appoint person for the purpose the commissioner enter into an able and laborious investigation and on make know to the probability of be able to conclude a new treaty with the delegate of all the division of the tribe who be fully empower to make any new arrangement which would heal all dissension among the cherokees and restore to ancient condition of peace and good brotherhood authorize and appoint to enter into negotiation with these delegate for the accomplishment of that object the treaty now transmit be the result of labor and be hope that will meet the approbation of congress and if carry out in good faith by all party to be believe will effect the great and desirable end have in view accompany the treaty be the report of the commissioner and also a communication to from john|ros and other who represent what be term the government party of the cherokees and which be transmit at request for the consideration of the senate be say that serious apprehension be to some extent entertain in which do not share that the peace of this district may be disturb before the 4th of march next in any event will be duty to preserve and this duty shall be perform in conclusion may be permit to to remark that have often warn countryman of the danger which now surround this may be the last time shall refer to the subject officially feel that duty have be faithfully though may be imperfectly perform and whatever the result may be shall carry to grave the consciousness that at least mean well for country transcript to the senate and house|of|representatif of the|united|state communicate herewith a copy of a convention for the settlement and adjustment of the oregon question which be conclude in this city on the|15th|day|of|june last between the|united|state and britannic majesty this convention have since be duly ratify by the respective party and the ratification be exchange at london on now become important that provision should be make by law at the early practicable period for the organization of a territorial government in oregon be also deem proper that law regulate trade and intercourse with the indian tribe east of the|rocky|mountain should be extend to such tribe within territory as dwell beyond and that a suitable number of indian agent should be appoint for the purpose of carry these law into execution be likewise important that mail facility so indispensable for the diffusion of information and for bind together the different portion of extend confederacy should be afford to citizen west of the|rocky|mountain there be another subject to which desire to call special attention be of great importance to country generally and especially to navigating and whale interest that the|pacific|coast and indeed the whole of territory west of the|rocky|mountain should speedily be fill up by a hardy and patriotic population emigrant to that territory have many difficulty to encounter and privation to endure in long and perilous journey and by the time reach place of destination pecuniary mean be generally much reduce if not altogether exhausted under these circumstance be deem but an act of justice that these emigrant whilst most effectually advance the interest and policy of the government should be aid by liberal grant of land would therefore recommend that such grant be make to actual settler upon the term and under the restriction and limitation which congress may think advisable transcript to have consider the bill entitle an act make appropriation for the improvement of certain harbor and river with the care which importance demand and now return the same to the|house|of|representatives in which originate with objection to become a law the bill propose to appropriate to be apply to more|than|forty distinct and separate object of improvement on examine provision and the variety of object of improvement which embrace many of of a local character be difficult to conceive if shall be sanction and become a law what practical constitutional restraint can hereafter be impose upon the most extended system of internal improvement by the|federal|government in all part of the union the constitution have not in judgment confer upon the|federal|government the power to construct work of internal improvement within the|state or to appropriate money from the treasury for that purpose that this bill assume for the|federal|government the right to exercise this power can not think be doubt the approve course of the government and the deliberately express judgment of the people have deny the existence of such a power under the constitution several of predecessor have deny existence in the most solemn form the general proposition that the|federal|government do not possess this power be so well settle and have for a considerable period be so generally acquiesce in that be not deem necessary to reiterate the argument by which be sustain nor do deem necessary after the full and elaborate discussion which have take place before the country on this subject to do more than to state the general consideration which have satisfy of the unconstitutionality and inexpediency of the exercise of such a power be not question that the|federal|government be of limited power power be such and such only as be expressly grant in the constitution or be properly incident to the expressly grant power and necessary to execution in determine whether a give power have be grant a sound rule of construction have be lay down by mr. madison that rule be whenever a question arise concern a particular power the first question be whether the power be express in the constitution if be the question be decide if be not express the next inquiry must be whether be properly an incident to an express power and necessary to execution if be may be exercise by congress if be not congress can not exercise be not pretend that there be any express grant in the constitution confer on congress the power in question be then an incidental power necessary and proper for the execution of any of the grant power all the grant power be confidently affirm may be effectually execute without the aid of such an incident a power to be incidental must not be exercise for end which make a principal or substantive power independent of the principal power to which be an incident be not enough that may be regard by congress as convenient or that exercise would advance the public weal must be necessary and proper to the execution of the principal express power to which be an incident and without which such principal power can not be carry into effect the whole frame of the|federal|constitution prove that the government which create be intend to be of limited and specify power a construction of the constitution so broad as that by which the power in question be defend tend imperceptibly to a consolidation of power in a government intend by framer to be thus limit in authority the obvious tendency and inevitable result of a consolidation of the states into sovereignty would be to transform the republican system of the|united|state into a monarchy to guard against the assumption of all power which encroach upon the reserve sovereignty of the states and which consequently tend to consolidation be the duty of all the true friend of political system that the power in question be not properly an incident to any of the grant power be fully satisfied but if there be doubt on this subject experience have demonstrate the wisdom of the rule that all the functionary of the|federal|government should abstain from the exercise of all questionable or doubtful power if an enlargement of the power of the|federal|government should be deem proper be safe and wise to appeal to the states and the people in the mode prescribe by the constitution for the grant desire than to assume exercise without an amendment of the constitution if congress do not possess the general power to construct work of internal improvement within the states or to appropriate money from the treasury for that purpose what be there to exempt some at least of the object of appropriation include in this bill from the operation of the general rule this bill assume the existence of the power and in some of provision assert the principle that congress may exercise as fully as though the appropriation which propose be applicable to the construction of road and canal if there be a distinction in principle be not perceive and should be clearly define some of the object of appropriation contain in this bill be local in character and lie within the limit of a single state and though in the language of the bill be call harbor be not connect with foreign commerce nor be place of refuge or shelter for navy or commercial marine on the ocean or lake shore to call the mouth of a creek or a shallow inlet on coast a harbor can not confer the authority to expend the public money in improvement congress have exercise the power coeval with the constitution of establish light house beacon buoy and pier on ocean and lake shore for the purpose of render navigation safe and easy and of afford protection and shelter for navy and other shipping these be safeguard place in exist channel of navigation after the long acquiescence of the government through all precede administrations be not dispose to question or disturb the authority to make appropriation for such purpose when advance a step beyond this point and in addition to the establishment and support by appropriation from the treasury of lighthouse beacon buoy pier and other improvement within the bay inlet and harbor on ocean and lake coast immediately connect with foreign commerce attempt to make improvement in the interior at point unconnected with foreign commerce and where be not need for the protection and security of navy and commercial marine the difficulty arise in draw a line beyond which appropriation may not be make by of predecessor who see the evil consequence of the system propose to be revive by this bill attempt to define this line by declare that expenditure of this character should be confine below the port of entry or delivery establish by law act on this restriction withhold sanction from a bill which have pass congress to improve the navigation of the|wabash|river be at the same time sensible that this restriction be not as satisfactory as could be desire and that much embarrassment may be cause to the executive department in execution by appropriation for remote and not well understand object this restriction be soon find be subject to be evade and render comparatively useless in check the system of improvement which be design to arrest in consequence of the facility with which port of entry and delivery may be establish by law upon the upper water and in some instance almost at the head spring of some of the most unimportant of river and at point on coast possess no commercial importance and not use as place of refuge and safety by navy and other shipping many of the port of entry and delivery now authorize by law so far as foreign commerce be concern exist only in the statute book no entry of foreign good be ever make and no duty be ever collect at no export of american product bind for foreign country ever clear from to assume that existence in the statute book as port of entry or delivery warrant expenditure on the water lead to which would be otherwise unauthorized would be to assert the proposition that the lawmaking power may ingraft new provision on the constitution if the restriction be a sound one can only apply to the bay inlet and river connect with or lead to such port as actually have foreign commerce port at which foreign importation arrive in bulk pay the duty charge by law and from which export be make to foreign country will be find by apply the restriction thus understand to the bill under consideration that contain appropriation for more|than|twenty object of internal improvement call in the bill harbor at place which have never be declare by law either port of entry or delivery and at which as appear from the record of the treasury there have never be an arrival of foreign merchandise and from which there have never be a vessel clear for a foreign country will be find that many of these work be new and at place for the improvement of which appropriation be now for the first time propose will be find also that the bill contain appropriation for river upon which there not only exist no foreign commerce but upon which there have not be establish even a paper port of entry and for the mouth of creek denominate harbor which if improve can benefit only the particular neighborhood in which be situate will be find too to contain appropriation the expenditure of which will only have the effect of improve place at the expense of the local natural advantage of another in vicinity should this bill become a law the same principle which authorize the appropriation which propose to make would also authorize similar appropriation for the improvement of all the other bay inlet and creek which may with equal propriety be call harbor and of all the river important or unimportant in every part of the union to sanction the bill with such provision would be to concede the principle that the|federal|government possess the power to expend the public money in a general system of internal improvement limit in extent only by the ever vary discretion of successive congresses and successive executives would be to efface and remove the limitation and restriction of power which the constitution have wisely provide to limit the authority and action of the|federal|government to a few well define and specified object besides these objection the practical evil which must flow from the exercise on the part of the|federal|government of the power assert in this bill impress mind with a grave sense of duty to avert from the country as far as constitutional action may enable to do so not only lead to a consolidation of power in the|federal|government at the expense of the rightful authority of the states but inevitable tendency be to embrace object for the expenditure of the public money which be local in character benefit but few at the expense of the common treasury of the whole will engender sectional feeling and prejudice calculate to disturb the harmony of the union will destroy the harmony which should prevail in legislative council will produce combination of local and sectional interest strong enough when united to carry proposition for appropriation of public money which could not of and stand alone succeed and can not fail to lead to wasteful and extravagant expenditure must produce a disreputable scramble for the public money by the conflict which be inseparable from such a system between local and individual interest and the general interest of the whole be unjust to those states which have with own mean construct own internal improvement to make from the common treasury appropriation for similar improvement in other states in operation will be oppressive and unjust toward those states whose representative and people either deny or doubt the existence of the power or think exercise inexpedient and who while equally contribute to the treasury can not consistently with opinion engage in a general competition for a share of the public money thus a large portion of the union in number and in geographical extent contribute equal proportion of taxis to the support of the government would under the operation of such a system be compel to see the national treasure the common stock of all unequally disburse and often improvidently waste for the advantage of small section instead of be apply to the great national purpose in which all have a common interest and for which alone the power to collect the revenue be give should the system of internal improvement propose prevail all these evil will multiply and increase with the increase of the number of the states and the extension of the geographical limit of the settle portion of country with the increase of number and the extension of settlement the local object demand appropriation of the public money for improvement will be proportionately increase in each case the expenditure of the public money would confer benefit direct or indirect only on a section while these section would become daily less in comparison with the whole the wisdom of the framer of the constitution in withholding power over such object from the|federal|government and leave to the local government of the states become more and more manifest with every year 's experience of the operation of system in a country of limited extent with but few such object of expenditure if the form of government permit a common treasury may be use for improvement with much less inequality and injustice than in of the vast extent which our now present in population and territory the treasure of the world would hardly be equal to the improvement of every bay inlet creek and river in country which may be suppose to promote the agricultural manufacturing or commercial interest of a neighborhood the|federal|constitution be wisely adapt in provision to any expansion of limit and population and with the advance of the confederacy of the states in the career of national greatness become the more apparent that the harmony of the union and the equal justice to which all part be entitle require that the|federal|government should confine action within the limit prescribe by the constitution to power and authority some of the provision of this bill be not subject to the objection state and do stand alone should not feel to be duty to withhold approval if no constitutional objection exist to the bill there be other of a serious nature which deserve some consideration appropriate between|$1,000,000|and|$2,000,000 for object which be of no press necessity and this be propose at a time when the country be engage in a foreign war and when congress at present session have authorize a loan or the issue of treasury note to defray the expense of the war to be resort to if the exigency of the government shall require would seem to be the dictate of wisdom under such circumstance to husband mean and not to waste on comparatively unimportant object so that may reduce the loan or issue of treasury note which may become necessary to the small practicable sum would seem to be wise too to abstain from such expenditure with a view to avoid the accumulation of a large public debt the existence of which would be oppose to the interest of people as well as to the genius of free institution should this bill become a law the principle which establish will inevitably lead to large and annually increase appropriation and drain upon the treasury for be not to be doubt that numerous other locality not embrace in provision but quite as much entitle to the favor of the government as those which be embrace will demand through representative in congress to be place on an equal footing with with such an increase of expenditure must necessarily follow either an increase public debt or increase burden upon the people by taxation to supply the treasury with the mean of meet the accumulate demand upon with profound respect for the opinion of congress and ever anxious as far as can consistently with responsibility to common constituent to cooperate with in the discharge of respective duty be with unfeigned regret that find constrain for the reason which have assign to withhold approval from this bill transcript to the senate of the|united|state lie before the senate a proposal in the form of a convention present to the secretary of state on the 6th instant by the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of her|britannic|majesty for the adjustment of the oregon question together with a protocol of this proceeding submit this proposal to the consideration of the senate and request advice as to the action which in judgment may be proper to take in reference to in the early period of the government the opinion and advice of the senate be often take in advance upon important question of foreign policy general washington repeatedly consult the senate and ask previous advice upon pende negotiation with foreign power and the senate in every instance respond to call by give advice to which always conform action this practice though rarely resort to in later time be in judgment eminently wise and may on occasion of great importance be properly revive the senate be a branch of the treaty make power and by consult in advance of own action upon important measure of foreign policy which may ultimately come before for consideration the president secure harmony of action between that body and the senate be moreover a branch of the war make power and may be eminently proper for the executive to take the opinion and advice of that body in advance upon any great question which may involve in decision the issue of peace or war on the present occasion the magnitude of the subject would induce under any circumstance to desire the previous advice of the senate and that desire be increase by the recent debate and proceeding in congress which render in judgment nor only respectful to the senate but necessary and proper if not indispensable to insure harmonious action between that body and the executive in confer on the executive the authority to give the notice for the abrogation of the convention of the senate act publicly so large a part that a decision on the proposal now make by without a definite knowledge of the view of that body in reference to may render the question still more complicated and difficult of adjustment for these reason invite the consideration of the senate to the proposal of the|british|government for the settlement of the oregon question and ask advice on the subject opinion and action on the oregon question be fully make known to congress in annual message of the of december last and the opinion therein express remain unchanged should the senate by the constitutional majority require for the ratification of treaty advise the acceptance of this proposition or advise with such modification as may upon full deliberation deem proper shall conform action to advice should the senate however decline by such constitutional majority to give such advice or to express an opinion on the subject shall consider duty to reject the offer also communicate herewith an extract from a dispatch of the secretary of state to the minister of the|united|state at london under date of the|28th|of|april|last direct in accordance with the joint resolution of congress concern

the|united|state the seventieth james|k.|polk by the president james|buchanan secretary of state transcript the exist state of the relation between the|united|state and mexico render proper that should bring the subject to the consideration of congress in message at the commencement of present session the state of these relation the cause which lead to the suspension of diplomatic intercourse between the country in march,|1845 and the long continued and unredressed wrong and injury commit by the|mexican|government on citizen of the|united|state in person and property be briefly set forth as the fact and opinion which be then lay before be carefully consider can not better express present conviction of the condition of affair up to that time than by refer to that communication the strong desire to establish peace with mexico on liberal and honorable term and the readiness of this government to regulate and adjust boundary and other cause of difference with that power on such fair and equitable principle as would lead to permanent relation of the most friendly nature induce in september last to seek the reopening of diplomatic relation between the country every measure adopt on part have for object the furtherance of these desire result in communicating to congress a succinct statement of the injury which have suffer from mexico and which have be accumulate during a period of more|than|twenty|year every expression that could tend to inflame the people of mexico or defeat or delay a pacific result be carefully avoid an envoy of the|united|state repair to mexico with full power to adjust every exist difference but though present on the mexican soil by agreement between the government invest with full power and bear evidence of the most friendly disposition mission have be unavaile the|mexican|government not only refuse to receive or listen to proposition but after a long continue series of menace have at last invade territory and shed the blood of fellow citizen on own soil now become duty to state more in detail the origin progress and failure of that mission in pursuance of the instruction give in september last an inquiry be make on the|13th|of|october,|1845 in the most friendly term through consul in mexico of the minister for foreign affair whether the|mexican|government would receive an envoy from the|united|state intrust with full power to adjust all the question in dispute between the government with the assurance that should the answer be in the affirmative such an envoy would be immediately dispatch to mexico the mexican minister on the|15th|of|october give an affirmative answer to this inquiry request at the same time that naval force at vera|cruz may be withdraw lest continued presence may assume the appearance of menace and coercion pende the negotiation this force be immediately withdraw on the|10th|of|november,|1845 mr. john|slidell of louisiana be commission by as envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the|united|state to mexico and be intrust with full power to adjust both the question of the texas boundary and of indemnification to citizen the redress of the wrong of citizen naturally and inseparably blend with the question of boundary the settlement of the question in any correct view of the subject involve that of the other could not for a moment entertain the idea that the claim of much injure and long suffer citizen many of which have exist for more|than|twenty|year should be postpone or separate from the settlement of the boundary question mr. slidell arrive at vera|cruz on the|30th|of|november and be courteously receive by the authority of that city but the government of general herrera be then totter to fall the revolutionary party have seize upon the texas question to effect or hasten overthrow determination to restore friendly relation with the|united|state and to receive minister to negotiate for the settlement of this question be violently assail and be make the great theme of denunciation against the government of general herrera there be good reason to believe be sincerely desirous to receive minister but yield to the storm raise by enemy and on the|21st|of|december refuse to accredit mr. slidell upon the most frivolous pretext these be so fully and ably expose in the note of mr. slidell of the|24th|of|december last to the mexican minister of foreign relation herewith transmit that deem unnecessary to enter into further detail on this portion of the subject five|day after the date of mr. slidell 's note general herrera yield the government to general|parede without a struggle and on the|30th|of|december resign the presidency this revolution be accomplish solely by the army the people have take little part in the contest and thus the supreme power in mexico pass into the hand of a military leader determine to leave no effort untrie to effect an amicable adjustment with mexico direct mr. slidell to present credential to the|government|of|general|paredes and ask to be officially receive by there would have be less ground for take this step have general|parede come into power by a regular constitutional succession in that event administration would have be consider but a mere constitutional continuance of the government of general herrera and the refusal of the latter to receive minister would have be deem conclusive unless an intimation have be give by general|parede of desire to reverse the decision of predecessor but the government of general paredes owe existence to a military revolution by which the subsist constitutional authority have be subvert the form of government be entirely change as well as all the high functionary by whom be administer under these circumstance mr. slidell in obedience to direction address a note to the mexican minister of foreign relation under date of the|1st|of|march last ask to be receive by that government in the diplomatic character to which have be appoint this minister in reply under date of the|12th|of|march reiterate the argument of predecessor and in term that may be consider as give just ground of offense to the government and people of the|united|state deny the application of mr. slidell nothing therefore remain for envoy but to demand passport and return to own country thus the government of mexico though solemnly pledge by official act in october last to receive and accredit an american envoy violate plight faith and refuse the offer of a peaceful adjustment of difficulty not only be the offer reject but the indignity of rejection be enhance by the manifest breach of faith in refuse to admit the envoy who come because have bind to receive nor can be say that the offer be fruitless from the want of opportunity of discuss envoy be present on own soil nor can be ascribe to a want of sufficient power envoy have full power to adjust every question of difference nor be there room for complaint that proposition for settlement be unreasonable permission be not even give envoy to make any proposition whatever nor can be object that on part would not listen to any reasonable term of suggestion the|mexican|government refuse all negotiation and have make no proposition of any kind in message at the commencement of the present session inform that upon the earnest appeal both of the congress and convention of texas have order an efficient military force to take a position between the nueces and the del norte this have become necessary to meet a threaten invasion of texas by the mexican force for which extensive military preparation have be make the invasion be threaten solely because texas have determine in accordance with a solemn resolution of the congress of the|united|state to annex to union and under these circumstance be plainly duty to extend protection over citizen and soil this force be concentrate at corpus|christi and remain there until after have receive such information from mexico as render probable if not certain that the|mexican|government would refuse to receive envoy meantime texas by the final action of congress have become an integral part of union the congress of texas by act of december|19,|1836 have declare the rio del norte to be the boundary of that republic jurisdiction have be extend and exercise beyond the nueces the country between that river and the|del|norte have be represent in the congress and in the convention of texas have thus take part in the act of annexation and be now include within of congressional district own congress have moreover with great unanimity by the act approve december|31,|1845 recognize the country beyond the nueces as a part of territory by include within own revenue system and a revenue officer to reside within that district have be appoint by and with the advice and consent of the senate become therefore of urgent necessity to provide for the defense of that portion of country accordingly on the|13th|of|january last instruction be issue to the general in command of these troop to occupy the left bank of the|del|norte this river which be the southwestern boundary of the|state of texas be an expose frontier from this|quarter invasion be threaten upon and in immediate vicinity in the judgment of high military experience be the proper station for the protect force of the government in addition to this important consideration several other occur to induce this movement among these be the facility afford by the port at brazos|santiago and the mouth of the|del|norte for the reception of supply by sea the strong and more healthful military position the convenience for obtain a ready and a more abundant supply of provision water fuel and forage and the advantage which be afford by the|del|norte in forward supply to such post as may be establish in the interior and upon the indian frontier the movement of the troop to the|del|norte be make by the commanding general under positive instruction to abstain from all aggressive act toward mexico or mexican citizen and to regard the relation between that republic and the|united|state as peaceful unless should declare war or commit act of hostility indicative of a state of war be specially direct to protect private property and respect personal right the army move from corpus|christi on the|11th|of|march and on the|28th|of|that|month arrive on the left bank of the del norte opposite to matamoras where encamp on a commanding position which have since be strengthen by the erection of fieldwork a depot have also be establish at point|isabel near the|brazos|santiago in rear of the encampment the selection of position be necessarily confide to the judgment of the general in command the mexican force at matamoras assume a belligerent attitude and on the|12th|of|april general ampudia then in command notify general taylor to break up camp within four|hours and to retire beyond the|nueces|river and in the event of failure to comply with these demand announce that arm and arm alone must decide the question but no open act of hostility be commit until the|24th|of|april on that|day general|arista who have succeed to the command of the mexican force communicate to general taylor that consider hostility commence and should prosecute a party of dragoon of man and officer be on the|same|day dispatch from the american camp up the|rio|del|norte on left bank to ascertain whether the mexican troop have cross or be prepare to cross the river become engaged with a large body of these troop and after a short affair in which some|16 be kill and wound appear to have be surround and compel to surrender the grievous wrong perpetrate by mexico upon citizen throughout a|long|period|of|year remain unredressed and solemn treaty pledge public faith for this redress have be disregard a government either unable or unwilling to enforce the execution of such treaty fail to perform of plain duty commerce with mexico have be almost annihilate be formerly highly beneficial to both nation but merchant have be deter from prosecute by the system of outrage and extortion which the mexican authority have pursue against whilst appeal through own government for indemnity have be make in vain forbearance have go to such an extreme as to be mistake in character have act with vigor in repel the insult and redress the injury inflict by mexico at the commencement should doubtless have escape all the difficulty in which be now involved instead of this however have be exert good effort to propitiate good will upon the pretext that texas a nation as independent as think proper to unite destiny with own have affect to believe that have sever rightful territory and in official proclamation and manifesto have repeatedly threaten to make war upon for the purpose of reconquer texas in the meantime have try every effort at reconciliation the cup of forbearance have be exhaust even before the recent information from the frontier of the|del|norte but now after reiterated menace mexico have pass the boundary of the|united|state have invade territory and shed american blood upon the american soil have proclaim that hostility have commence and that the nation be now at war as war exist and notwithstanding all effort to avoid exist by the act of mexico be call upon by every consideration of duty and patriotism to vindicate with decision the honor the right and the interest of country anticipate the possibility of a crisis like that which have arrive instruction be give in august last as a precautionary measure against invasion or threaten invasion authorize general taylor if the emergency require to accept volunteer not from texas only but from alabama mississippi tennessee and kentucky and correspond letter be address to the respective governor of those states these instruction be repeat and in january last soon after the incorporation of texas into union|of|state general taylor be further authorize by the president to make a requisition upon the executive of that state for such of militia force as may be need to repel invasion or to secure the country against apprehend invasion on be again remind in the event of the approach of any considerable mexican force promptly and efficiently to use the authority with which be clothe to call to such auxiliary force as may need war actually exist and territory have be invade general taylor pursuant to authority vest in by direction have call on the governor of texas for regiment of state troop to be mount and to serve on foot and on the governor of louisiana for regiment of infantry to be send to as soon as practicable in further vindication of right and defense of territory invoke the prompt action of congress to recognize the existence of the war and to place at the disposition of the executive the mean of prosecute the war with vigor and thus hasten the restoration of peace to this end recommend that authority should be give to call into the public service a large body of volunteer to serve for not less than or month unless sooner discharge a volunteer force be beyond question more efficient than any other description of citizen soldier and be not to be doubt that a number far beyond that require would readily rush to the field upon the call of country further recommend that a liberal provision be make for sustain entire military force and furnish with supply and munition of war the most energetic and prompt measure and the immediate appearance in arm of a large and overpower force be recommend to congress as the most certain and efficient mean of bring the exist collision with mexico to a speedy and successful termination in make these recommendation deem proper to declare that be anxious desire not only to terminate hostility speedily but to bring all matter in dispute between this government and mexico to an early and amicable adjustment and in this view shall be prepare to renew negotiation whenever mexico shall be ready to receive proposition or to make proposition of own transmit herewith a copy of the correspondence between envoy to mexico and the mexican minister for foreign affair and so much of the correspondence between that envoy and the secretary of state and between the secretary of war and the general in command on the|del|norte as be necessary to a full understanding of the subject transcript in annual message of the of december last be state that serious difficulty of long standing continue to distract the several party into which the cherokee tribe of indians be unhappily divide that all the effort of the government to adjust these difficulty have prove to be unsuccessful and would probably remain so without the aid of further legislation by congress subsequent event have confirm this opinion communicate herewith for the information of congress a report of the secretary of war transmit a report of the commissioner of indian|affairs with accompany document together with memorial which have be receive from the several band or party of the cherokees will be perceive that internal feud still exist which call for the prompt intervention of since the meeting of congress several unprovoked murder have be commit by the strong upon the weak party of the tribe which will probably remain unpunished by the indian authority and there be reason to apprehend that similar outrage will continue to be perpetrate unless restrain by the authority of the|united|state many of the weak party have be compel to seek refuge beyond the limit of the indian country and within the|state|of|arkansas and be destitute of the mean for daily subsistence the military force of the|united|state station on the western frontier have be active in exertion to suppress these outrage and to execute the treaty of by which be stipulate that the|united|state agree to protect the|cherokee|nation from domestic strife and foreign enemy and against intestine war between the several tribe these exertion of the army have prove to a great extent unavailing for the reason state in the accompany document include communication from the officer command at fort|gibson submit for the consideration of congress the propriety of make such amendment of the law regulate intercourse with the indian tribe as will subject to trial and punishment in the court of the|united|state all indians guilty of murder and such other felony as may be designate when commit on other indians within the jurisdiction of the|united|state such a modification of the exist law be suggest because if offender against the law of humanity in the indian country be leave to be punish by indian law will generally if not always be permit to escape with impunity this have be the case in repeat instance among the cherokees for year unprovoked murder have be commit and yet no effort have be make to bring the offender to punishment should this state of thing continue be not difficult to foresee that the weak party will be finally destroy as the guardian of the indian tribe the|united|state be bind by every consideration of duty and humanity to interpose to prevent such a disaster from the examination which have make into the actual state of thing in be satisfied that there be no probability that the different band or party into which be divide can ever again live together in peace and harmony and that the well being of the whole require that should be separate and live under separate government as distinct tribe that portion who emigrate to the west of the mississippi prior to the|year|1819 commonly call the old settler and that portion who make the treaty of know as the treaty party be believe would willingly unite and could live together in harmony the number of these as nearly as can be estimate be about|one third of the tribe the whole number on all the band or party do not probably exceed the country which occupy embrace 7,000,000|acre of land with the privilege of an outlet to the western limit of the|united|state this country be susceptible of division and be large enough for all submit to congress the propriety of either divide the country which at present occupy or of provide by law a new home for the or the other of the band or party now in hostile array against each other as the most effectual if not the only mean of preserve the weak party from massacre and total extermination should congress favor the division of the country as suggest and the separation of the cherokees into distinct tribe justice will require that the annuity and fund belong to the whole now hold in trust for by the|united|state should be equitably distribute among the party accord to respective claim and number there be still a small number of the cherokee tribe remain within the|state|of|north|carolina who accord to the stipulation of the treaty of should have emigrate with brother to the west of the mississippi be desirable that should be remove and in the event of a division of the country in the west or of a new home be provide for a portion of the tribe that be permit to join either party as may prefer and be incorporate with submit the whole subject to congress that such legislative measure may be adopt as will be just to all the party or band of the tribe such measure be satisfied be the only mean of arrest the horrid and inhuman massacre which have mark the history of the cherokees for the|last|few|year and especially for the|last|few|month the cherokees have be regard as among the most enlighten of the indian tribe but experience have prove that have not yet advanced to such a state of civilization as to dispense with the guardian care and control of transcript in answer to the inquiry of the senate contain in resolution of the 17th instant whether in judgment any circumstance connect with or grow out of the foreign relation of this country require at this time an increase of naval or military force and if so what those circumstance be have to express the opinion that a wise precaution demand such increase in annual message of the of december last recommend to the favorable consideration of congress an increase of naval force especially of steam navy and the raising of an adequate military force to guard and protect such of citizen as may think proper to emigrate to oregon since that period have see no cause to recall or modify these recommendation on the contrary reason exist which in judgment render proper not only that should be promptly carry into effect but that additional provision should be make for the public defense the consideration of such additional provision be bring before appropriate committee of the houses|of|congress in answer to call make by in report prepare with sanction by the secretary of war and the secretary of the navy on and the|8th|of|january|last a mode of communication with congress not unusual and under exist circumstance believe to be most eligible subsequent event have confirm in the opinion that these recommendation be proper as precautionary measure be a wise maxim of the father of country that to be prepare for war be of the most efficient mean of preserve peace and that avoid occasion of expense by cultivate peace should remember also that timely disbursement to prepare for danger frequently prevent much great disbursement to repel the general obligation to perform this duty be greatly strengthen by fact know to the whole world a controversy respect the|oregon|territory now exist between the|united|state and great|britain and while as far as know the relation of the latter with all european nation be of the most pacific character be make unusual and extraordinary armament and warlike preparation naval and military both at home and in north|american possession can not be disguise that however sincere may be the desire of peace in the event of a rupture these armament and preparation would be use against country whatever may have be the original purpose of these preparation the fact be undoubted that be now proceed in part at least with a view to the contingent possibility of a war with the|united|state the general policy of make additional warlike preparation be distinctly announce in the speech from the throne as late as january last and have since be reiterate by the minister of the crown in both house of parliament under this aspect of relation with great|britain can not doubt the propriety of increase mean of defense both by land and sea this can give great|britain no cause of offense nor increase the danger of a rupture if on the contrary should fold arm in security and at last be suddenly involve in hostility for the maintenance of just right without any adequate preparation responsibility to the country would be of the grave character should collision between the country be avoid as sincerely trust may be the additional charge upon the treasury in make the necessary preparation will not be lose while in the event of such a collision would be indispensable for the maintenance of national right and national honor have see no reason to change or modify the recommendation of annual message in regard to the oregon question the notice to abrogate the treaty of the|6th|of|august,|1827 be authorize by the treaty and can not be regard as a warlike measure and can not withhold strong conviction that should be promptly give the other recommendation be in conformity with the exist treaty and would afford to american citizen in oregon no more than the same measure of protection which have long since be extend to british subject in that territory the state of relation with mexico be still in an unsettled condition since the meeting of congress another revolution have take place in that country by which the government have pass into the hand of new ruler this event have procrastinate and may possibly defeat the settlement of the difference between the|united|state and that country the minister of the|united|state to mexico at the date of the last advice have not be receive by the exist authority demonstration of a character hostile to the|united|state continue to be make in mexico which have render proper in judgment to keep nearly|two third of army on southwestern frontier in do this many of the regular military post have be reduce to a small force inadequate to defense should an emergency arise in view of these circumstance be judgment that an increase of naval and military force be at this time require to place the country in a suitable state of defense at the same time be settled purpose to pursue such a course of policy as may be best calculate to preserve both with great|britain and mexico an honorable peace which nothing will so effectually promote as unanimity in council and a firm maintenance of all just right transcript fellow citizens of the senate and of the|house|of|representatives be to a source of unaffected satisfaction to meet the representative of

the element of national greatness the affection of the people be confirm for and for the doctrine of popular liberty which lie at the foundation of government become in humility to make devout acknowledgment to the|supreme|ruler|of|the|universe for the inestimable civil and religious blessing with which be favor in call the attention of congress to relation with foreign power be gratify to be able to state that though with some of there have exist since last session serious cause of irritation and misunderstanding yet no actual hostility have take place adopt the maxim in the conduct of foreign affair to ask nothing that be not right and submit to nothing that be wrong have be anxious desire to preserve peace with all nation but at the same time to be prepare to resist aggression and maintain all just right in pursuance of the joint resolution of congress for annex texas to the|united|state predecessor on the|3d|day|of|march,|1845 elect to submit the first and second section of that resolution to the|republic|of|texas as an overture on the part of the|united|state for admission as a state into union this election approve and accordingly the charge d'affaire of the|united|state in texas under instruction of the|10th|of|march,|1845 present these section of the resolution for the acceptance of that republic the executive government the congress and the people of texas in convention have successively comply with all the term and condition of the joint resolution a constitution for the government of the|state of texas form by a convention of deputy be herewith lay before congress be well know also that the people of texas at the poll have accept the term of annexation and ratify the constitution communicate to congress the correspondence between

annexation which be offer by the|united|state have be accept by texas the public faith of both party be solemnly pledge to the compact of union nothing remain to consummate the event but the passage of an act by congress to admit the state of texas into the union upon an equal footing with the original states strong reason exist why this should be do at an early period of the session will be observe that by the constitution of texas the exist government be only continue temporarily till congress can act and that the third monday of the|present|month be the|day appoint for hold the first general election on that|day a governor a lieutenant governor and both branch of the legislature will be choose by the people the president of texas be require immediately after the receipt of official information that the new state have be admit into union by congress to convene the legislature and upon meeting the exist government will be supersede and the state government organize question deeply interesting to texas in common with the other states the extension of revenue law and judicial system over people and territory as well as measure of a local character will claim the early attention of congress and therefore upon every principle of republican government ought to be represent in that body without unnecessary delay can not too earnestly recommend prompt action on this important subject as soon as the act to admit texas as a state shall be pass the union of the republics will be consummate by own voluntary consent this accession to territory have be a bloodless achievement no arm of force have be raise to produce the result the sword have have no part in the victory have not seek to extend territorial possession by conquest or republican institution over a reluctant people be the deliberate homage of each people to the great principle of federative union if consider the extent of territory involve in the annexation prospective influence on america the mean by which have be accomplish spring purely from the choice of the people to share the blessing of union the history of the world may be challenge to furnish a parallel the jurisdiction of the|united|state which at the formation of the|federal|constitution be bound by the|st.|mary on the atlantic have pass the cape of florida and be peacefully extend to the|del|norte in contemplate the grandeur of this event be not to be forget that the result be achieve in despite of the diplomatic interference of european monarchy even france the country which have be ancient ally the country which have a common interest with in maintain the freedom of the sea the country which by the cession of louisiana first open to access to the|gulf|of|mexico the country with which have be every year draw more and more closely the bond of successful commerce most unexpectedly and to unfeigned regret take part in an effort to prevent annexation and to impose on texas as a condition of the recognition of independence by mexico that would never join to the|united|state may rejoice that the tranquil and pervade influence of the american principle of self government be sufficient to defeat the purpose of british and french interference and that the almost unanimous voice of the people of texas have give to that interference a peaceful and effective rebuke from this example european|government may learn how vain diplomatic art and intrigue must ever prove upon this continent against that system of self government which seem natural to soil and which will ever resist foreign interference toward texas do not doubt that a liberal and generous spirit will actuate congress in all that concern interest and prosperity and that will never have cause to regret that have unite lone star to glorious constellation regret to inform that relation with mexico since last session have not be of the amicable character which be desire to cultivate with all foreign nation on the|6th|day|of|march last the mexican envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to the|united|state make a formal protest in the name of government against the joint resolution pass by congress for the annexation of texas to the|united|state which choose to regard as a violation of the right of mexico and in consequence of demand passport be inform that the|government|of|the|united|state do not consider this joint resolution as a violation of any of the right of mexico or that afford any just cause of offense to government that the|republic|of|texas be an independent power owe no allegiance to mexico and constitute no part of territory or rightful sovereignty and jurisdiction be also assure that be the sincere desire of this government to maintain with that of mexico relation of peace and good understanding that functionary however notwithstanding these representation and assurance abruptly terminate mission and shortly afterwards leave the country envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to mexico be refuse all official intercourse with that government and after remain several|months by the permission of own government return to the|united|state thus by the act of mexico all diplomatic intercourse between the country be suspend since that time mexico have until recently occupy an attitude of hostility toward the|united|state have be marshal and organize army issue proclamation and avow the intention to make war on the|united|state either by an open declaration or by invade texas both the congress and convention of the people of texas invite this government to send an army into that territory to protect and defend against the menace attack the moment the term of annexation offer by the|united|state be accept by texas the latter become so far a part of own country as to make duty to afford such protection and defense therefore deem proper as a precautionary measure to order a strong squadron to the coast of mexico and to concentrate an efficient military force on the western frontier of texas army be order to take position in the country between the nueces and the|del|norte and to repel any invasion of the texan territory which may be attempt by the mexican force squadron in the gulf be order to cooperate with the army but though army and navy be place in a position to defend own and the right of texas be order to commit no act of hostility against mexico unless declare war or be the aggressor by strike the first blow the result have be that mexico have make no aggressive movement and military and naval commander have execute order with such discretion that the peace of the republics have not be disturb texas have declare independence and maintain by arm for more|than|nine|year have have an organize government in successful operation during that period separate existence as an independent state have be recognize by the|united|state and the principal power of europe treaty of commerce and navigation have be conclude with by different nation and have become manifest to the whole world that any further attempt on the part of mexico to conquer or overthrow government would be vain even mexico have become satisfied of this fact and whilst the question of annexation be pende before the people of texas during the|past|summer the government of mexico by a formal act agree to recognize the independence of texas on condition that would not annex to any other power the agreement to acknowledge the independence of texas whether with or without this condition be conclusive against mexico the independence of texas be a fact concede by mexico and have no right or authority to prescribe restriction as to the form of government which texas may afterwards choose to assume but though mexico can not complain of the|united|state on account of the annexation of texas be to be regret that serious cause of misunderstanding between the country continue to exist grow out of unredressed injury inflict by the mexican authority and people on the person and property of citizen of the|united|state through a long series of year mexico have admit these injury but have neglect and refuse to repair such be the character of the wrong and such the insult repeatedly offer to american citizen and the american flag by mexico in palpable violation of the law of nation and the treaty between the country of the 5th of april,|1831 that have be repeatedly bring to the notice of congress by predecessor as|early|as|the|6th|of|february,|1837 the president of the|united|state declare in a message to congress the length of time since some of the injury have be commit the repeat and unavaile application for redress the wanton character of some of the outrage upon the property and person of citizen upon the officer and flag of the|united|state independent of recent insult to this government and people by the late extraordinary mexican minister would justify in the eye of all nation immediate war do not however recommend an immediate resort to this extreme measure which declare should not be use by just and generous nation confide in strength for injury commit if can be honorably avoid but in a spirit of forbearance propose that another demand be make on mexico for that redress which have be so long and unjustly withhold in these view committee of the houses|of|congress in report make to respective body concur since these proceeding more|than|eight|year have elapse during which in addition to the wrong then complain of other of an aggravated character have be commit on the person and property of citizen a special agent be send to mexico in the|summer|of|1838 with full authority to make another and final demand for redress the demand be make the|mexican|government promise to repair the wrong of which complain and after much delay a treaty of indemnity with that view be conclude between the power on the|11th|of|april,|1839 and be duly ratify by both government by this treaty a joint commission be create to adjudicate and decide on the claim of american citizen on the government of mexico the commission be organize at washington on the|25th|day|of|august,|1840 time be limit to eighteen|months at the expiration of which have adjudicate and decide claim amount to in favor of citizen of the|united|state against the|mexican|government leave a large amount of claim undecided of the latter the american commissioner have decide in favor of citizen claim amount to which be leave unacted on by the umpire authorize by the treaty still further claim amount to between|three|and|four million of dollar be submit to the board too late to be consider and be leave undisposed of the sum of decide by the board be a liquidated and ascertained debt due by mexico to the claimant and there be no justifiable reason for delay payment accord to the term of the treaty be not however pay mexico apply for further indulgence and in that spirit of liberality and forbearance which have ever mark the policy of the|united|state toward that republic the request be grant and on the|30th|of|january,|1843 a new treaty be conclude by this treaty be provide that the interest due on the award in favor of claimant under the convention of the|11th|of|april,|1839 should be pay out the|30th|of|april,|1843 and the principal of the say award and the interest accrue

examination and settlement by a joint commission be conclude and sign at mexico on this treaty be ratify by the|united|state with certain amendment to which no just exception could have be take but have not yet receive the ratification of the|mexican|government in the meantime citizen who suffer great loss and some of whom have be reduce from affluence to bankruptcy be without remedy unless right be enforce by government such a continued and unprovoked series of wrong could never have be tolerate by the|united|state have be commit by of the principal nation of europe mexico be however a neighboring sister republic which follow example have achieve independence and for whose success and prosperity all sympathy be early enlist the|united|state be the first to recognize independence and to receive into the family of nation and have ever be desirous of cultivate with a good understanding have therefore bear the repeat wrong have commit with great patience in the hope that a return sense of justice would ultimately guide council and that may if possible honorably avoid any hostile collision with without the previous authority of congress the executive possess no power to adopt or enforce adequate remedy for the injury have suffer or to do more than to be prepared to repel the threaten aggression on the part of mexico after army and navy have remain on the frontier and coast of mexico for many|week without any hostile movement on part though menace be continue deem important to put an end if possible to this state of thing with this view cause step to be take in the|month|of|september last to ascertain distinctly and in an authentic form what the design of the|mexican|government be whether be intention to declare war or invade texas or whether be dispose to adjust and settle in an amicable manner the pende difference between the country on the|9th|of|november an official answer be receive that the|mexican|government consent to renew the diplomatic relation which have be suspend in march last and for that purpose be willing to accredit a minister from the|united|state with a sincere desire to preserve peace and restore relation of good

be appoint envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to mexico clothe with full power to adjust and definitively settle all pende difference between the country include those of boundary between mexico and the|state of texas the minister appoint have set out on mission and be probably by this time near the mexican capital have be instruct to bring the negotiation with which be charge to a conclusion at the early practicable period which be expect will be in time to enable to communicate the result to congress during the present session until that result be know forbear to recommend to congress such ulterior measure of redress for the wrong and injury have so long bear as would have be proper to make have no such negotiation be institute congress appropriate at the last session the sum of for the payment of the april|and|july installment of the mexican indemnity for the|year|1844 provide shall be ascertain to the satisfaction of the|american|government that say

citizen then in mexico with a view of have communicate to that department from this appear that the agent on the|20th|of|september,|1844 give a receipt to the treasury of mexico for the amount of the april|and|july installment of the indemnity in the same communication however assert that have not receive a single dollar in cash but that hold such security as warrant at the time in give the receipt and entertain no doubt but that will eventually obtain the money as these installment appear never to have be actually pay by the|government|of|mexico to the agent and as that government have not therefore be release so as to discharge the claim do not feel warrant in direct payment to be make to the claimant out of the treasury without further legislation case be undoubtedly of much hardship and remain for congress to decide whether any and what relief ought to be grant to minister to mexico have be instruct to ascertain the fact of the case from the|mexican|government in an authentic and official form and report the result with as little delay as possible attention be early direct to the negotiation which on the|4th|of|march last find pende at washington between the|united|state and great|britain on the subject of several attempt have be previously make to settle the question in dispute between the country by negotiation upon the principle of compromise but each have prove unsuccessful these negotiation take place at london in the|years|1818,|1824 and under the administration of mr. monroe and the last under that of mr. adams the negotiation of have fail to accomplish object result in the convention of the|20th|of|october|of|that|year by the third article of that convention agree that any country that may be claim by either party on the northwest coast of america westward of the stony|mountain shall together with harbor bay and creek and the navigation of all river within the same be free and open for the term of ten|year from the date of the signature of the present convention to the vessel citizen and subject of the power be well understand that this agreement be not to be construe to the prejudice of any claim which either of the high contracting party may have to any part of the say country nor shall be take to affect the claim of any other power or state to any part of the say country the only object of the high contracting party in that respect be to prevent dispute and difference amongst the negotiation of be productive of no result and the convention of be leave unchanged the negotiation of have also fail to effect an adjustment by compromise result in the convention of august|6,|1827 by which be agree to continue in force for an indefinite period the provision of the third article of the convention of the|20th|of|october,|1818 and be further provide shall be competent however to either of the contracting party in case either should think fit at any time after the 20th of october on give due notice of twelve|month to the other contracting party to annul and abrogate this convention and shall in such case be accordingly entirely annul and abrogate after the expiration of the said term of notice in these attempt to adjust the controversy the parallel of the ninth degree of north latitude have be offer by the|united|state to great|britain and in those of and with a further concession of the free navigation of the columbia|river south of that latitude the parallel of the ninth degree from the|rocky|mountain to intersection with the northeasternmost branch of the columbia and thence down the channel of that river to the sea have be offer by great|britain with an addition of a small detach territory north of the columbia each of these proposition have be reject by the party respectively in october,|1843 the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the|united|state in london be authorize to make a similar offer to those make in and thus stand the question when the negotiation be shortly afterwards transfer to washington and on be formally open under the direction of immediate predecessor like all the previous negotiation be base upon principle of compromise and the avowed purpose of the party be to treat of the respective claim of the country to the|oregon|territory with the view to establish a permanent boundary between westward of the|rocky|mountain to accordingly on the|26th|of|august,|1844 the british plenipotentiary offer to divide the|oregon|territory by the ninth parallel of north latitude from the|rocky|mountain to the point of intersection with the northeasternmost branch of and thence down that river to the sea leave the free navigation of the river to be enjoy in common by both party the country south of this line to belong to the|united|state and that north of to great|britain at the same time propose in addition to yield to the|united|state a detached territory north of the columbia extend along the pacific and the straits of fuca from bulfinchs|harbor inclusive to hoods|canal and to make free to the|united|state any port or port south of latitude ° which may desire either on the mainland or on quadra and vancouvers|island with the exception of the free port this be the same offer which have be make by the british and reject by in the negotiation of this proposition be properly reject by the american plenipotentiary on the|day be submit this be the only proposition of compromise offer by the british plenipotentiary the proposition on the part of great|britain have be reject the british plenipotentiary request that a proposal should be make by the|united|state for an equitable adjustment of the question when come into office find this to be the state of the negotiation though entertain the settle conviction that the british pretension of title could not be maintain to any portion of the oregon|territory upon any principle of public law recognize by nation yet in deference to what have be do by predecessor and especially in consideration that proposition of compromise have be thrice make by precede administrations to adjust the question on the parallel of and in of yield to great|britain the free navigation of the columbia and that the pende negotiation have be commence on the basis of compromise deem to be duty not abruptly to break off in consideration too that under the convention of and the citizen and subject of the power hold a joint occupancy of the country be induce to make another effort to settle this long pende controversy in the spirit of moderation which have give birth to the renew discussion a proposition be accordingly make which be reject by the british plenipotentiary who without submit any other proposition suffer the negotiation on part to drop express trust that the|united|states would offer what see fit to call some further proposal for the settlement of the oregon question more consistent with fairness and equity and with the reasonable expectation of the|british|government the proposition thus offer and reject repeat the offer of the parallel of of north latitude which have be make by precede administrations but without propose to surrender to great|britain as have do the free navigation of the right of any foreign power to the free navigation of any of river through the heart of country be which be unwilling to concede also embrace a provision to make free to great|britain any port or port on the cap of quadra and vancouvers|island south of this parallel have this be a new question come under discussion for the first time this proposition would not have be make the extraordinary and wholly inadmissible demand of the|british|government and the rejection of the proposition make in deference alone to what have be do by predecessor and the imply obligation which act seem to impose afford satisfactory evidence that no compromise which the|united|stat ought to accept can be effect with this conviction the proposition of compromise which have be make and reject be by direction subsequently withdraw and title to the whole oregon|territory assert and as be believe maintain by irrefragable fact and argument the civilized world will see in these proceeding a spirit of liberal concession on the part of the|united|state and this government will be relieve from all responsibility which may follow the failure to settle the controversy all attempt at compromise have fail become the duty of congress to consider what measure may be proper to adopt for the security and protection of citizen now inhabit or who may hereafter inhabit oregon and for the maintenance of just title to that territory in adopt measure for this purpose care should be take that nothing be do to violate the stipulation of the convention of which be still in force the faith of treaty in letter and spirit have ever be and trust will ever be scrupulously observe by the|united|state under that convention a year 's notice be require to be give by either party to the other before the joint occupancy shall terminate and before either can rightfully assert or exercise exclusive jurisdiction over any portion of the territory this notice would in judgment be proper to give and recommend that provision be make by law for give accordingly and terminate in this manner the convention of the|6th|of|august,|1827 will become proper for congress to determine what legislation can in the meantime adopt without violate this convention beyond all question the protection of law and jurisdiction civil and criminal ought to be immediately extend over citizen in oregon have have just cause to complain of long neglect in this particular and have in consequence be compel for own security and protection to establish a provisional government for strong in allegiance and ardent in attachment to the|united|state have be thus cast upon own resource be anxious that law should be extend over and recommend that this be do by congress with as little delay as possible in the full extent to which the|british|parliament have proceed in regard to british subject in that territory by act of july|2,|1821 for regulate the fur trade and establish a criminal and civil jurisdiction within certain part of north|america by this act great|britain extend law and jurisdiction civil and criminal over subject engage in the fur trade in that territory by the court of the|province|of|upper|canada be empower to take cognizance of cause civil and criminal justice of the peace and other judicial officer be authorize to be appoint in oregon with power to execute all process issue from the court of that province and to sit and hold court of record for the trial of criminal offense and misdemeanor not make the subject of capital punishment and also of civil case where the cause of action shall not exceed in value the amount or sum of lbs subsequent to the date of this act of parliament a grant be make from the|"british|crown to the|hudsons|bay|company of the exclusive trade with the indian tribe in the|oregon|territory subject to a reservation that shall not operate to the exclusion of the subject of any foreign state who under or by force of any convention for the time be between and such foreign state respectively may be entitle to and shall be engage in the said trade be much to be regret that while under this act british subject have enjoy the protection of british law and british judicial tribunal throughout the whole of oregon american citizen in the same territory have enjoy no such protection from government at the same time the result illustrate the character of people and institution in spite of this neglect have multiply and number be rapidly increase in that territory have make no appeal to arm but have peacefully fortify in new home by the adoption of republican institution for furnish another example of the truth that self government be inherent in the american breast and must prevail be due to that should be embrace and protect by law be deem important that law regulate trade and intercourse with the indian tribe east of the|rocky|mountain should be extend to such tribe as dwell beyond the increase emigration to oregon and the care and protection which be due from the government to citizen in that distant region make duty as be interest to cultivate amicable relation with the indian tribe of that territory for this purpose recommend that provision be make for establish an indian agency and such subagencie as may be deem necessary beyond the|rocky|mountain for the protection of emigrant whilst on way to oregon against the attack of the indian tribe occupy the country through which pass recommend that a suitable number of stockade and blockhouse fort be erect along the usual route between frontier settlement on the missouri and the|rocky|mountain and that an adequate force of mount rifleman be raise to guard and protect on journey the immediate adoption of these recommendation by congress will not violate the provision of the exist treaty will be do nothing more for american citizen than british law have long since do for british subject in the same territory require several|month to perform the voyage by sea from the|atlantic|state to oregon and although have a large number of whale ship in the pacific but few of afford an opportunity of interchange intelligence without great delay between settlement in that distant region and the|united|state an overland mail be believe to be entirely practicable and the importance of establish such a mail at least once a month be submit to the favorable consideration of congress be submit to the wisdom of congress to determine whether at present session and until after the expiration of the year 's notice any other measure may be adopt consistently with the convention of for the security of right and the government and protection of citizen in oregon that will ultimately be wise and proper to make liberal grant of land to the patriotic pioneer who amidst privation and danger lead the way through savage tribe inhabit the vast wilderness intervene between frontier settlement and oregon and who cultivate and be ever ready to defend the soil be fully satisfied to doubt whether will obtain such grant as soon as the convention between the|united|state and great|britain shall have cease to exist would be to doubt the justice of congress but pende the year 's notice be worthy of consideration whether a stipulation to this effect may be make consistently with the spirit of that convention the recommendation which have make as to the good manner of secure right in oregon be submit to congress with great deference should in wisdom devise any other mode better calculate to accomplish the same object shall meet with hearty concurrence at the|end|of|the|year 's notice should congress think proper to make provision for give that notice shall have reach a period when the national right in oregon must either be abandon or firmly maintain that can not be abandon without a sacrifice of both national honor and interest be too clear to admit of doubt oregon be a part of the north|american continent to which be confidently affirm the title of the|united|state be the good now in existence for the ground on which that title rest refer to the correspondence of the late and present secretary of state with the british plenipotentiary during the negotiation the british proposition of compromise which would make the columbia the line south of ° with a trifling addition of detach territory to the|united|states north of that river and would leave on the british side third of the whole oregon|territory include the free navigation of the columbia and all the valuable harbor on the pacific can never for a moment be entertain by the|united|state without an abandonment of just and dear territorial right own self respect and the national honor for the information of congress communicate herewith the correspondence which take place between the government during the late negotiation the rapid extension of settlement over territory heretofore unoccupied the addition of new states to confederacy the expansion of free principle and rise greatness as a nation be attract the attention of the power of europe and lately the doctrine have be broach in some of of a balance of power on this continent to check advancement the|united|state sincerely desirous of preserve relation of good understanding with all nation can not in silence permit any european interference on the north|american continent and should any such interference be attempt will be ready to resist at any and all hazard be well known to the american people and to all nation that this government have never interfere with the relation subsist between other government have never make party to war or alliance have not seek territory by conquest have not mingle with party in domestic struggle and believe own form of government to be the good have never attempt to propagate by intrigue by diplomacy or by force may claim on this continent a like exemption from european interference the nation of america be equally sovereign and independent with those of europe possess the same right independent of all foreign interposition to make war to conclude peace and to regulate internal affair the people of the|united|state can not therefore view with indifference attempt of european power to interfere with the independent action of the nation on this continent the american system of government be entirely different from that of europe jealousy among the different sovereign of europe lest any of may become too powerful for the rest have cause anxiously to desire the establishment of what term the balance of power can not be permit to have any application on the north|american continent and especially to the|united|state must ever maintain the principle that the people of this continent alone have the right to decide own destiny should any portion of constitute an independent state propose to unite with confederacy this will be a question for and to determine without any foreign interposition can never consent that european power shall interfere to prevent such a union because may disturb the balance of power which may desire to maintain upon this continent near|a|quarter of a century ago the principle be distinctly announce to the world in the annual message of of predecessor the american continent by the free and independent condition which have assume and maintain be henceforth not to be consider as subject for colonization by any european power this principle will apply with greatly increase force should any european power attempt to establish any new colony in north|america in the exist circumstance of the world the present be deem a proper occasion to reiterate and reaffirm the principle avow by mr. monroe and to state cordial concurrence in wisdom and sound policy the reassertion of this principle especially in reference to north|america be at this|day but the promulgation of a policy which no european power should cherish the disposition to resist exist right of every european nation should be respect but be due alike to safety and interest that the efficient protection of law should be extend over whole territorial limit and that should be distinctly announce to the world as settled policy that no future european colony or dominion shall with consent be plant or establish on any part of the north|american continent a question have recently arise under the tenth article of the subsist treaty between the|united|state and prussia by this article the consul of the country have the right to sit as judge and arbitrator in such difference as may arise between the captain and crew of the vessel belong to the nation whose interest be commit to charge without the interference of the local authority unless the conduct of the crew or of the captain should disturb the order or tranquillity of the country or the say consul should require assistance to cause decision to be carry into effect or support the prussian consul at new|bedford in june,|1844 apply to mr. justice story to carry into effect a decision make by between the captain and crew of the prussian ship borussia but the request be refuse on the ground that without previous legislation by congress the judiciary do not possess the power to give effect to this article of the treaty the|prussian|government through minister here have complain of this violation of the treaty and have ask the|government|of|the|united|state to adopt the necessary measure to prevent similar violation hereafter good faith to prussia as well as to other nation with whom have similar treaty stipulation require that these should be faithfully observe have deem proper therefore to lay the subject before congress and to recommend such legislation as may be necessary to give effect to these treaty obligation by virtue of an arrangement make between the|spanish|government and that of the|united|state in december,|1831 american vessel since the|29th|of|april,|1832 have be admit to entry in the port of spain include those of the balearic and canary island on payment of the same tonnage duty of per ton as though have be spanish vessel and this whether vessel arrive in spain directly from the|united|state or indirectly from any other country when congress by the|act|of|13th|july,|1832 give effect to this arrangement between the government confine the reduction of tonnage duty merely to spanish vessel come from a port in spain leave the former discriminate duty to remain against such vessel come from a port in any other country be manifestly unjust that whilst american vessel arrive in the port of spain from other country pay no more duty than spanish vessel spanish vessel arrive in the port of the|united|state from other country should be subject to heavy discriminate tonnage duty this be neither equality nor reciprocity and be in violation of the arrangement conclude in december,|1831 between the country the|spanish|government have make repeat and earnest remonstrance against this inequality and the favorable attention of congress have be several time invoke to the subject by predecessor recommend as an act of justice to spain that this inequality be remove by congress and that the discriminate duty which have be levy under the act of the|13th|of|july,|1832 on spanish vessel come to the|united|state from any other foreign country be refund this recommendation do not embrace spanish vessel arrive in the|united|state from cuba and porto|rico which will still remain subject to the provision of the act of june|30,|1834 concern tonnage duty on such vessel by the act of the|14th|of|july,|1832 coffee be exempt from duty altogether this exemption be universal without reference to the country where be produce or the national character of the vessel in which be import by the tariff act of the|30th|of|august,|1842 this exemption from duty be restrict to coffee import in american vessel from the place of production whilst coffee import under all other circumstance be subject to a duty of ad valorem under this act and exist treaty with the|king|of|the netherlands|java coffee import from the european port of that kingdom into the|united|state whether in dutch or american vessel now pay this rate of duty the government of the netherlands complain that such a discriminate duty should have be impose on coffee the production of of colony and which be chiefly bring from java to the port of that kingdom and export from thence to foreign country trade with the netherlands be highly beneficial to both country and relation with have ever be of the most friendly character under all the circumstance of the case recommend that this discrimination should be abolish and that the coffee of java import from the netherlands be place upon the same footing with that import directly from brazil and other country where be produce under the eighth section of the tariff act of the|30th|of|august,|1842 a duty of per gallon be impose on port wine in cask while on the red wine of several other country when import in cask a duty of only|6|cent per gallon be impose this discrimination so far as regard the port wine of portugal be deem a violation of treaty with that power which provide that-- no high or other duty shall be impose on the importation into the|united|states|of|america of any article the growth produce or manufacture of the kingdom and possession of portugal than such as be or shall be payable on the like article be the growth produce or manufacture of any other foreign country accordingly to give effect to the treaty as well as to the intention of congress express in a proviso to the tariff act that nothing therein contain should be so construe as to interfere with subsist treaty with foreign nation a treasury circular be issue on the|16th|of|july,|1844 which among other thing declare the duty on the port wine of portugal in cask under the exist law and treaty to be 6|cent per gallon and direct that the excess of duty which have be collect on such wine should be refund by virtue of another clause in the same section of the act be provide that all imitation of port or any other wine shall be subject to the duty provide for the genuine article imitation of port wine the production of france be import to some extent into the|united|state and the government of that country now claim that under a correct construction of the act these imitation ought not to pay a high duty than that impose upon the original port wine of portugal appear to to be unequal and unjust that french imitation of port wine should be subject to a duty of while the more valuable article from portugal should pay a duty of 6|cent only per gallon therefore recommend to congress such legislation as may be necessary to correct the inequality the late president in annual message of december last recommend an appropriation to satisfy the claim of the|texan|government against the|united|state which have be previously adjust so far as the power of the executive extend these claim arise out of the act of disarm a body of texan troop under the command of major snively by an officer in the service of the|united|state act under the order of government and the forcible entry into the custom house at bryarlys|landing on by certain citizen of the|united|state and take away therefrom the good seize by the collector of the custom as forfeit under the law of texas this be a liquidated debt ascertain to be due to texas when an independent state acceptance of the term of annexation propose by the|united|state do not discharge or invalidate the claim recommend that provision be make for payment the commissioner appoint to china during the special session of the senate in march last shortly afterwards set out on mission in ship columbus on arrive at rio|de|janeiro on passage the state of health have become so critical that by the advice of medical attendant return to early|in|the|month|of|october|last commodore biddle command the|east|india|squadron proceed on voyage in the columbus and be charge by the commissioner with the duty of exchange with the proper authority the ratification of the treaty lately conclude with the emperor of china since the return of the commissioner to the|united|states health have be much improve and entertain the confident belief that will soon be able to proceed on mission unfortunately difference continue to exist among some of the nation of south|america which follow example have establish independence while in other internal dissension prevail be natural that sympathy should be warmly enlist for welfare that should desire that all controversy between should be amicably adjust and government administer in a manner to protect the right and promote the prosperity of people be contrary however to settle policy to interfere in controversy whether external or internal have thus advert to all the subject connect with foreign relation to which deem necessary to call attention policy be not only peace with all but good will toward all the power of the earth while be just to all require that all shall be just to except the difference with mexico and great|britain relation with all civilized nation be of the most satisfactory character be hope that in this enlighten age these difference may be amicably adjust the secretary of the treasury in annual report to congress will communicate a full statement of the condition of finance the import for the|fiscal|year|ending|on|the|30th|of|june|last be of the value of of which the amount export be leave a balance of for domestic consumption the export for the|same|year be of the value of of which the amount of domestic article be the receipt into the treasury during the|same|year be of which there be derive from custom from sale of public land and from incidental and miscellaneous source the expenditure for the same period be of which be apply to the payment of the public debt the balance in the treasury on the|1st|of|july last be the amount of the public debt remain unpaid on the|1st|of|october|last be further payment of the public debt would have be make in anticipation of the period of reimbursement under the authority confer upon the secretary of the treasury by the act of july|21,|1841 and of april|15,|1842 and march|3,|1843 have not the unsettled state of relation with mexico menace hostile collision with that power in view of such a contingency be deem prudent to retain in the treasury an amount unusually large for ordinary purpose a|few|years|ago whole national debt grow out of the|revolution|and|the|war|of|1812 with great|britain be extinguish and present to the world the rare and noble spectacle of a great and grow people who have fully discharge every obligation since that time the exist debt have be contract and small as be in comparison with the similar burden of most other nation should be extinguish at the early practicable period should the state of the country permit and especially if foreign relation interpose no obstacle be contemplate to apply all the money in the treasury as accrue beyond what be require for the appropriation by congress to liquidation cherish the hope of soon be able to congratulate the country on recovering once more the lofty position which so recently occupy country which exhibit to the world the benefit of self government in develop all the source of national prosperity owe to mankind the permanent example of a nation free from the blighting influence of a public debt the attention of congress be invite to the importance of make suitable modification and reduction of the rate of duty impose by present tariff law the object of impose duty on import should be to raise revenue to pay the necessary expense of government congress may undoubtedly in the exercise of a sound discretion discriminate in arrange the rate of duty on different article but the discrimination should be within the revenue standard and be make with the view to raise money for the support of government become important to understand distinctly what be mean by a revenue standard the maximum of which should not be exceed in the rate of duty impose be concede and experience prof that duty may be lay so high as to diminish or prohibit altogether the importation of any give article and thereby lessen or destroy the revenue which at low rate would be derive from importation such duty exceed the revenue rate and be not impose to raise money for the support of government if congress levy a duty for revenue of on a give article will produce a give amount of money to the treasury and will incidentally and necessarily afford protection or advantage to the amount of to the home manufacturer of a similar or like article over the importer if the duty be raise to will produce a great amount of money and afford great protection if be still raise to or and if as be raise the revenue derive from be find to be increase the protection or advantage will also be increase but if be raise to and be find that the revenue produce at that rate be less than at cease to be a revenue duty the precise point in the ascend scale of duty at which be ascertain from experience that the revenue be great be the maximum rate of duty which can be lay for the bona fide purpose of collect money for the support of government to raise the duty high than that point and thereby diminish the amount collect be to levy for protection merely and not for revenue as long then as congress may gradually increase the rate of duty on a give article and the revenue be increase by such increase of duty be within the revenue standard when go beyond that point and as increase the duty the revenue be diminish or destroy the act cease to have for object the raising of money to support government but be for protection merely do not follow that congress should levy the high duty on all article of import which will bear within the revenue standard for such rate would probably produce a much large amount than the economical administration of the government would require nor do follow that the duty on all article should be at the same or a horizontal rate some article will bear a much high revenue duty than other below the maximum of the revenue standard congress may and ought to discriminate in the rate impose take care so to adjust on different article as to produce in the aggregate the amount which when add to the proceed of the sale of public land may be need to pay the economical expense of the government in levy a tariff of duty congress exercise the tax power and for purpose of revenue may select the object of taxation may exempt certain article altogether and permit importation free of duty on other may impose low duty in these class should be embrace such article of necessity as be in general use and especially such as be consume by the laborer and poor as well as by the wealthy citizen care should be take that all the great interest of the country include manufacture agriculture commerce navigation and the mechanic art should as far as may be practicable derive equal advantage from the incidental protection which a just system of revenue duty may afford taxation direct or indirect be a burden and should be so impose as to operate as equally as may be on all class in the proportion of ability to bear to make the tax power an actual benefit to class necessarily increase the burden of the other beyond proportion and would be manifestly unjust the term protection to domestic industry be of popular import but should apply under a just system to all the various branch of industry in country the farmer or planter who toil yearly in field be engage in domestic industry and be as much entitled to have labor protect as the manufacturer the man of commerce the navigator or the mechanic who be engage also in domestic industry in different pursuit the joint labor of all these class constitute the aggregate of the domestic industry of the nation and be equally entitle to the nation 's protection no one of can justly claim to be the exclusive recipient of protection which can only be afford by increase burden on the domestic industry of the other if these view be correct remain to inquire how far the tariff act of be consistent with that many of the provision of that act be in violation of the cardinal principle here lay down all must concede the rate of duty impose by on some article be prohibitory and on other so high as greatly to diminish importation and to produce a less amount of revenue than would be derive from low rate operate as protection merely to branch of domestic industry by tax other branch by the introduction of minimum or assume and false value and by the imposition of specific duty the injustice and inequality of the act of in practical operation on different class and pursuit be see and feel many of the oppressive duty impose by under the operation of these principle range from to more|than|200 per cent be prohibitory on some article and partially so on other and bear most heavily on article of common necessity and but lightly on article of luxury be so frame that much the great burden which impose be throw on labor and the poor class who be least able to bear while protect capital and exempt the rich from pay just proportion of the taxation require for the support of government while protect the capital of the wealthy manufacturer and increase profit do not benefit the operative or laborer in employment whose wage have not be increase by article of prime necessity or of coarse quality and low price use by the masse of the people be in many instance subject by to heavy taxis while article of finer quality and high price or of luxury which can be use only by the opulent be lightly tax impose heavy and unjust burden on the farmer the planter the commercial man and those of all other pursuit except the capitalist who have make investment in manufacture all the great interest of the country be not as nearly as may be practicable equally protect by the government in theory know no distinction of person or class and should not bestow upon some favor and privilege which all other may not enjoy be the purpose of illustrious founder to base the institution which rear upon the great and unchanging principle of justice and equity conscious that if administer in the spirit in which be conceive would be feel only by the benefit which diffuse and would secure for a defense in the heart of the people more powerful than stand army and all the mean and appliance invent to sustain government found in injustice and oppression the well know fact that the tariff act of be pass by a majority of vote in the senate and in the|house|of|representatives and that some of those who feel constrain under the peculiar circumstance exist at the time to vote in favor proclaim defect and express determination to aid in modification on the first opportunity afford strong and conclusive evidence that be not intend to be permanent and of the expediency and necessity of thorough revision in recommend to congress a reduction of the present rate of duty and a revision and modification of the|act|of|1842 be far from entertaining opinion unfriendly to the manufacturer on the contrary desire to see prosperous as far as can be so without impose unequal burden on other interest the advantage under any system of indirect taxation even within the revenue standard must be in favor of the manufacturing interest and of this no other interest will complain recommend to congress the abolition of the minimum principle or assume arbitrary and false value and of specific duty and the substitution in place of ad valorem duty as the fair and most equitable indirect tax which can be impose by the ad valorem principle all article be tax accord to cost or value and those which be of inferior quality or of small cost bear only the just proportion of the tax with those which be of superior quality or great cost the article consume by all be tax at the same rate a system of ad valorem revenue duty with proper discrimination and proper guard against fraud in collect be not doubted will afford ample incidental advantage to the manufacturer and enable to derive as great profit as can be derive from any other regular business be believe that such a system strictly within the revenue standard will place the manufacturing interest on a stable footing and inure to permanent advantage while will as nearly as may be practicable extend to all the great interest of the country the incidental protection which can be afford by revenue law such a system when once firmly establish would be permanent and not be subject to the constant complaint agitation and change which must ever occur when duty be not lay for revenue but for the protection merely of a favor interest in the deliberation of congress on this subject be hope that a spirit of mutual concession and compromise between conflict interest may prevail and that the result of labor may be crown with the happy consequence by the|united|state be provide that no money shall be draw from the treasury but in consequence of appropriation make by law a public treasury be undoubtedly contemplate and intend to be create in which the public money should be keep from the period of collection until need for public us in the collection and disbursement of the public money no agency have ever be employ by law except such as be appoint by the government directly responsible to and under control the safe keeping of the public money should be confide to a public treasury create by law and under like responsibility and control be not to be imagine that the framer of the constitution could have intend that a treasury should be create as a place of deposit and safe keeping of the public money which be irresponsible to the government the first congress under the constitution by the act of the|2d of september,|1789 to establish the|treasury|department provide for the appointment of a treasurer and make duty to receive and keep the money of the|united|state and at all time to submit to the secretary of the treasury and the comptroller or either of the inspection of the money in hand that bank national or state could not have be intend to be use as a substitute for the treasury speak of in the constitution as keeper of the public money be manifest from the fact that at that time there be no national bank and but three|or|four state bank of limited capital exist in the country employment as depository be at first resort to a limited extent but with no avowed intention of continue permanently in place of the treasury of the constitution when be afterwards from time to time employ be from motif of suppose convenience experience have show that when banking corporation have be the keeper of the public money and be thereby make in effect the treasury the government can have no guaranty that can command the use of own money for public purpose the late bank|of|the|united|state prove to be faithless the state bank which be afterwards employ be faithless but a|few|years|ago with million of public money in keeping the government be bring almost to bankruptcy and the public credit seriously impair because of inability or indisposition to pay on demand to the public creditor in the only currency recognize by the constitution failure occur in a period of peace and great inconvenience and loss be suffer by the public from have the country be involve in a foreign war that inconvenience and loss would have be much great and may have result in extreme public calamity the public money should not be mingle with the private fund of bank or individual or be use for private purpose when be place in bank for safe keeping be in effect loan to without interest and be loan by upon interest to the borrower from the public money be convert into banking capital and be use and loan out for the private profit of bank stockholder and when call for as be the case in may be in the pocket of the borrower from the bank instead of be in the public treasury contemplate by the constitution the framer of the constitution could never have intend that the money pay into the treasury should be thus convert to private use and place beyond the control of the government bank which hold the public money be often tempt by a desire of gain to extend loan increase circulation and thus stimulate if not produce a spirit of speculation and extravagance which sooner or later must result in ruin to thousand if the public money be not permit to be thus use but be keep in the treasure and pay out to the public creditor in gold and silver the temptation afford by deposit with bank to an undue expansion of business would be check while the amount of the constitutional currency leave in circulation would be enlarge by employment in the public collection and disbursement and the bank would in consequence be find in a safe and sounder condition at present state bank be employ as depository but without adequate regulation of law whereby the public money can be secure against the casualty and excess revulsion suspension and defalcation to which from overissue overtrade an inordinate desire for gain or other cause be constantly expose the secretary of the treasury have in all case when be practicable take collateral security for the amount which hold by the pledge of stock of the|united|state or such of the states as be in good credit some of the deposit bank have give this description of security and other have decline to do so entertain the opinion that the separation of the money of the government from banking institution be indispensable for the safety of the fund of the government and the right of the people recommend to congress that provision be make by law for such separation and that a constitutional treasury be create for the safe keeping of the public money the constitutional treasury recommend be design as a secure depository for the public money without any power to make loan or discount or to issue any paper whatever as a currency or circulation can not doubt that such a treasury as be contemplate by the constitution should be independent of all banking corporation the money of the people should be keep in the treasury of the people create by law and be in the custody of agent of the people choose by accord to the form of the constitution agent who be directly responsible to the government who be under adequate bond and oath and who be subject to severe punishment for any embezzlement private use or misapplication of the public fund and for any failure in other respect to perform duty to say that the people or government be incompetent or not to be trust with the custody of own money in own treasury provide by but must rely on the president cashier and stockholder of banking corporation not appoint by nor responsible to would be to concede that be incompetent for self government in recommend the establishment of a constitutional treasury in which the public money shall be keep desire that adequate provision be make by law for safety and that all executive discretion or control over shall be remove except such as may be necessary in direct disbursement in pursuance of appropriation make by law under present land system limit the minimum price at which the public land can be enter to per acre large quantity of land of inferior quality remain unsold because will not command that price from the record of the|general|land|office appear that of the public land remain unsold in the several states and territories in which be situate 39,105,577|acre have be in the market subject to entry more|than year for more|than|fifteen|year for more|than|ten|year and 106,176,961|acre for more|than|five|year much the large portion of these land will continue to be unsalable at the minimum price at which be permit to be sell so long as large territory of land from which the more valuable portion have not be select be annually bring into market by the government with the view to the sale and settlement of these inferior land recommend that the price be graduate and reduce below the present minimum rate confine the sale at the reduce price to settler and cultivator in limited quantity if graduate and reduce in price for a limited term to per acre and after the expiration of that period for a second and third term to low rate a large portion of these land would be purchase and many worthy citizen who be unable to pay high rate could purchase home for and family by adopt the policy of graduation and reduction of price these inferior land will be sell for real value while the states in which lie will be free from the inconvenience if not injustice to which be subject in consequence of the|united|state continue to own large quantity of the public land within border not liable to taxation for the support of local government recommend the continuance of the policy of grant preemption in most liberal extent to all those who have settle or may hereafter settle on the public land whether survey or unsurveyed to which the indian title may have be extinguish at the time of settlement have be find by experience that in consequence of combination of purchaser and other cause a very small quantity of the public land when sell at public auction command a high price than the minimum rate establish by law the settler on the public land be however but rarely able to secure home and improvement at the public sale at that rate because these combination by mean of the capital command and superior ability to purchase render impossible for the settler to compete with in the market by put down all competition these combination of capitalist and speculator be usually enable to purchase the land include the improvement of the settler at the minimum price of the government and either turn out of home or extort from accord to ability to pay double or quadruple the amount pay for to the government be to the enterprise and perseverance of the hardy pioneer of the west who penetrate the wilderness with family suffer the danger the privation and hardship attend the settlement of a new country and prepare the way for the body of emigrant who in the course of a|few|year usually follow that be in a great degree indebte for the rapid extension and aggrandizement of country experience have prove that no portion of population be more patriotic than the hardy and brave man of the frontier or more ready to obey the call of country and to defend right and honor whenever and by whatever enemy assail should be protect from the grasp speculator and secure at the minimum price of the public land in the humble home which have improve by labor with this end in view all vexatious or unnecessary restriction impose upon by the exist preemption law should be repeal or modify be the true policy of the government to afford facility to citizen to become the owner of small portion of vast public domain at low and moderate rate the present system of manage the mineral land of the|united|state be believe to be radically defective more|than|1,000,000|acre of the public land suppose to contain lead and other mineral have be reserve from sale and numerous lease upon have be grant to individual upon a stipulate rent the system of grant lease have prove to be not only unprofitable to the government but unsatisfactory to the citizen who have go upon the land and must if continue lie the foundation of much future difficulty between the government and the lessee accord to the official record the amount of rent receive by the|government|for|the|years and be while the expense of the system during the same period include salary of superintendent agent clerk and incidental expense be the income be fourth of the expense to this pecuniary loss may be add the injury sustain by the public in consequence of the destruction of timber and the careless and wasteful manner of work the mine the system have give rise to much litigation between the|united|state and individual citizen produce irritation and excitement in the mineral region and involve the government in heavy additional expenditure be believe that similar loss and embarrassment will continue to occur while the present system of lease these land remain unchanged these land be now under the superintendence and care of the|war|department with the ordinary duty of which have no proper or natural connection recommend the repeal of the present system and that these land be place under the superintendence and management of the|general|land|office as other public land and be bring into market and sell upon such term as congress in wisdom may prescribe reserve to the government an equitable percentage of the gross amount of mineral product and that the preemption principle be extend to resident miner and settler upon at the minimum price which may be establish by congress refer to the accompanying report of the secretary of war for information respect the present situation of the army and operation during the|past|year the state of defense the condition of the public work and relation with the various indian tribe within limit or upon border invite attention to the suggestion contain in that report in relation to these prominent object of national interest when order be give during the|past|summer for concentrate a military force on the western frontier of texas troop be widely disperse and in small detachment occupy post remote from each other the prompt and expeditious manner in which an army embrace more|than|half peace establishment be draw together on an emergency so sudden reflect great credit on the officer who be intrust with the execution of these order as well as upon the discipline of the army to be in strength to protect and defend the people and territory of texas in the event mexico should commence hostility or invade territory with a large army which threaten authorize the general assign to the command of the army of occupation to make requisition for additional force from several of the|state nearest the texan territory and which could most expeditiously furnish if in opinion a large force than that under command and the auxiliary aid which under like circumstance be authorize to receive from texas should be require the contingency upon which the exercise of this authority depend have not occur the circumstance under which company of state artillery from the city of new|orleans be send into texas and muster into the service of the|united|state be fully state in the report of the secretary of war recommend to congress that provision be make for the payment of these troop as well as a small number of texan volunteer whom the commanding general think necessary to receive or muster into service during the|last|summer the|first|regiment|of|dragoon make extensive excursion through the indian country on border a part of advance nearly to the possession of the|hudsons|bay|company in the north and a part as far as the|south|pas of the|rocky|mountain and the head water of the tributary stream of the colorado of the west the exhibition of this military force among the indian tribe in those distant region and the council hold with by the commander of the expedition be believe will have a salutary influence in restrain from hostility among and maintain friendly relation between and the|united|state an interesting account of of these excursion accompany the report of the secretary of war under the direction of the|war|department|brevet|captain|fremont of the|corps|of|topographical|engineer have be employ since in explore the country west of the mississippi and beyond the|rocky|mountain expedition have already be bring to a close and the report of that scientific and enterprising officer have furnish much interesting and valuable information be now engage in a third expedition but be not expect that this arduous service will be complete in season to enable to communicate the result to congress at the present session relation with the indian tribe be of a favorable character the policy of remove to a country design for permanent residence west of the mississippi and without the limit of the organize states and territories be better appreciate by than be a|few|years|ago while education be now attend to and the habit of civilized life be gain ground among serious difficulty of long standing continue to distract the several party into which the cherokees be unhappily divide the effort of the government to adjust the difficulty between have heretofore prove unsuccessful and there remain no probability that this desirable object can be accomplish without the aid of further legislation by congress will at an early period of session present the subject for consideration accompany with an exposition of the complaint and claim of the several party into which the nation be divide with a view to the adoption of such measure by congress as may enable the executive to do justice to respectively and to put an end if possible to the dissension which have long prevail and still prevail among refer to the report of the secretary of the navy for the present condition of that branch of the national defense and for grave suggestion have for object the increase of efficiency and a great economy in management during the|past|year the officer and man have perform duty in a satisfactory manner the order which have be give have be execute with promptness and fidelity a large force than have often form squadron under flag be readily concentrate in the|gulf|of|mexico and apparently without unusual effort be especially to be observe that notwithstanding the union of so considerable a force no act be commit that even the jealousy of an irritated power could construe as an act of aggression and that the commander of the squadron and officer in strict conformity with instruction hold ever ready for the most active duty have achieve the still purer glory of contribute to the preservation of peace be believe that at all foreign station the honor of flag have be maintain and that generally ship of war have be distinguish for good discipline and order be happy to add that the display of maritime force which be require by the event of the summer have be make wholly within the usual appropriation for the service of the|year so that no additional appropriation be require the commerce of the|united|state and with the navigate interest have steadily and rapidly increase since the organization of government until be believe be now second to but power in the world and at no distant day shall probably be inferior to none expose as must be have be a wise policy to afford to these important interest protection with ship of war distribute in the great highway of trade throughout the world for more|than|thirty|year appropriation have be make and annually expend for the gradual increase of naval force in peace navy perform the important duty of protect commerce and in the event of war will be as have be a most efficient mean of defense the successful use of steam navigation on the ocean have be follow by the introduction of war steamer in great and increase number into the navy of the principal maritime power of the world a due regard to own safety and to an efficient protection to large and increase commerce demand a corresponding increase on part no country have great facility for the construction of vessel of this description than our or can promise great advantage from employment be admirably adapt to the protection of commerce to the rapid transmission of intelligence and to the coast defense in pursuahce of the wise policy of a gradual increase of navy large supply of live oak timber and other material for shipbuilding have be collect and be now under shelter and in a state of good preservation while iron steamer can be build with great facility in various part of the union the use of iron as a material especially in the construction of steamer which can enter with safety many of the harbor along coast now inaccessible to vessel of great draft and the practicability of construct in the interior strongly recommend that liberal appropriation should be make for this important object whatever may have be policy in the early stage of the government when the nation be in infancy shipping interest and commerce comparatively small resource limit population sparse and scarcely extend beyond the limit of the original states that policy must be essentially different now that have grow from to more|than|twenty|million of people that commerce carry in own ship be find in every sea and that territorial boundary and settlement have be so greatly expand neither commerce nor long line of coast on the ocean and on the lakes can be successfully defend against foreign aggression by mean of fortification alone these be essential at important commercial and military point but chief reliance for this object must be on a well organize efficient navy the benefit result from such a navy be not confine to the|atlantic|state the production of the interior which seek a market abroad be directly dependent on the safety and freedom of commerce the occupation of the balize below new|orleans by a hostile force would embarrass if not stagnate the whole export trade of the mississippi and affect the value of the agricultural product of the entire valley of that mighty river and tributary have never be policy to maintain large standing army in time of peace be contrary to the genius of free institution would impose heavy burden on the people and be dangerous to public liberty reliance for protection and defense on the land must be mainly on citizen soldier who will be ever ready as ever have be ready in time past to rush with alacrity at the call of country to defense this description of force however can not defend coast harbor and inland sea nor protect commerce on the ocean or the lakes these must be protect by navy consider an increase naval force and especially of steam vessel correspond with growth and importance as a nation and proportion to the increase and increase naval power of other nation of vast importance as regard safety and the great and grow interest to be protect by recommend the subject to the favorable consideration of congress the report of the postmaster general herewith communicate contain a detailed statement of the operation of department during the|pass|year will be see that the income from postage will fall short of the expenditure for the|year between|$1,000,000|and|$2,000,000 this deficiency have be cause by the reduction of the rate of postage which be make by the act of the of march last no principle have be more generally acquiesce in by the people than that this department should sustain by limit expenditure to income congress have never seek to make a source of revenue for general purpose except for a short period during the last war with great|britain nor should ever become a charge on the general treasury if congress shall adhere to this principle as think ought will be necessary either to curtail the present mail service so as to reduce the expenditure or so to modify the act of the of march last as to improve revenue the extension of the mail service and the additional facility which will be demand by the rapid extension and increase of population on western frontier will not admit of such curtailment as will materially reduce the present expenditure in the adjustment of the tariff of postage the interest of the people demand that the low rate be adopt which will produce the necessary revenue to meet the expenditure of the department invite the attention of congress to the suggestion of the|postmaster general on this subject under the belief that such a modification of the late law may be make as will yield sufficient revenue without further call on the treasury and with very little change in the present rate of postage proper measure have be take in pursuance of the act of the of march last for the establishment of line of mail steamer between this and foreign country the importance of this service commend strongly to favorable consideration with the growth of country the public business which devolve on the head of the several executive departments have greatly increase in some respect the distribution of duty among seem to be incongruous and many of these may be transfer from to another with advantage to the public interest a more auspicious time for the consideration of this subject by congress with a view to system in the organization of the several departments and a more appropriate division of the public business will not probably occur the most important duty of the state|department relate to foreign affair by the great enlargement of the family of nation the increase of commerce and the corresponding extension of consular system the business of this department have be greatly increase in present organization many duty of a domestic nature and consist of detail be devolve on the secretary of state which do not appropriately belong to the foreign department of the government and may properly be transfer to some other department of these grow out of the present state of the law concern the|patent|office which a|few|year since be a subordinate clerkship but have become a distinct bureau of great importance with an excellent internal organization be still connect with the|state|department in the transaction of business question of much importance to inventor and to the community frequently arise which by exist law be refer for decision to a board of which the secretary of state be a member these question be legal and the connection which now exist between the|state|department and the|patent|office may with great propriety and advantage be transfer to the attorney general in last|annual message to congress mr. madison invite attention to a proper provision for the attorney general as an important improvement in the executive establishment this recommendation be repeat by some of successor the official duty of the attorney general have be much increase within a|few|year and office have become of great importance duty may be still further increase with advantage to the public interest as an executive officer residence and constant attention at the seat of government be require legal question involve important principle and large amount of public money be constantly refer to by the president and executive|department for examination and decision the public business under official management before the judiciary have be so augment by the extension of territory and the act of congress authorize suit against the|united|state for large body of valuable public land as greatly to increase labor and responsibility therefore recommend that the attorney general be place on the same footing with the head of the other executive|department with such subordinate officer provide by law for department as may be require to discharge the additional duty which have be or may be devolve upon congress possess the power of exclusive legislation over and commend the interest of inhabitant to favorable consideration the people of this district have no legislative body of own and must confide local as well as general interest to representative in whose election have no voice and over whose official conduct have no control each member of the|national|legislature should consider as immediate representative

and how powerful for mischief be intend to be a plain and frugal government and shall regard to be duty to recommend to congress and as far as the executive be concern to enforce by all the mean within power the strict economy in the expenditure of the public money which may be compatible with the public interest a national debt have become almost an institution of european monarchy be view in some of as an essential prop to exist government melancholy be the condition of that people whose government can be sustain only by a system which periodically transfer large amount from the labor of the many to the coffer of the few such a system be incompatible with the end for which republican government be institute under a wise policy the debt contract in revolution and during the|war|of|1812 have be happily extinguish by a judicious application of the revenue not require for other necessary purpose be not doubt that the debt which have grow out of the circumstance of the|last|few|year may be speedily pay off congratulate fellow citizen on the entire restoration of the credit of the general government of the union and that of many of the state happy would be for the indebte state if be free from liability many of which be incautiously contract although the government of the union be neither in a legal nor a moral sense bind for the debt of the state and would be a violation of compact of union to assume yet can not but feel a deep interest in see all the state meet public liability and pay off just debt at the early practicable period that will do so as soon as can be do without impose too heavy burden on citizen there be no reason to doubt the sound moral and honorable feeling of the people of the indebte state can not be question and be happy to perceive a settle disposition on part as ability return after a season of unexampled pecuniary embarrassment to pay off all just demand and to acquiesce in any reasonable measure to accomplish that object of the difficulty which have have to encounter in the practical administration of the government consist in the adjustment of revenue law and the levy of the taxis necessary for the support of government in the general proposition that no more money shall be collect than the necessity of an economical administration shall require all party seem to acquiesce nor do there seem to be any material difference of opinion as to the absence of right in the government to tax section of country or class of citizen or occupation for the mere profit of another justice and sound policy forbid the federal government to foster branch of industry to the detriment of another or to cherish the interest of portion to the injury of another portion of common country have heretofore declare to fellow citizen that in judgment be the duty of the government to extend as far as may be practicable to do so by revenue law and all other mean within power fair and just protection to all of the great interest of the whole union embrace agriculture manufacture the mechanic art commerce and navigation have also declare opinion to be in favor of a tariff for revenue and that in adjust the detail of such a tariff have sanction such moderate discriminating duty as would produce the amount of revenue need and at the same time afford reasonable incidental protection to home industry and that be oppose to a tariff for protection merely and not for revenue the power to lay and collect taxis duty impost and excise be an indispensable one to be confer on the federal government which without would possess no mean of provide for own support in execute this power by levy a tariff of duty for the support of government the raising of revenue should be the object and protection the incident to reverse this principle and make protection the object and revenue the incident would be to inflict manifest injustice upon all other than the protect interest in levy duty for revenue be doubtless proper to make such discrimination within the revenue principle as will afford incidental protection to home interest within the revenue limit there be a discretion to discriminate beyond that limit the rightful exercise of the power be not concede the incidental protection afford to home interest by discrimination within the revenue range be believe will be ample in make discrimination all home interest should as far as practicable be equally protect the large portion of people be agriculturist other be employ in manufacture commerce navigation and the mechanic art be all engage in respective pursuit and joint labor constitute the national or home industry to tax branch of this home industry for the benefit of another would be unjust no one of these interest can rightfully claim an advantage over the other or to be enrich by impoverish the other all be equally entitle to the fostering care and protection of the government in exercise a sound discretion in levy discriminate duty within the limit prescribe care should be take that be do in a manner not to benefit the wealthy few at the expense of the toil million by tax low the luxury of life or article of superior quality and high price which can only be consume by the wealthy and high the necessary of life or article of coarse quality and low price which the poor and great mass of people must consume the burden of government should as far as practicable be distribute justly and equally among all class of population these general view long entertain on this subject have deem proper to reiterate be a subject upon which conflict interest of section and occupation be suppose to exist and a spirit of mutual concession and compromise in adjust detail should be cherish by every part of widespread country as the only mean of preserve harmony and a cheerful acquiescence of all in the operation of revenue law patriotic citizen in every part of the union will readily submit to the payment of such taxis as shall be need for the support of government whether in peace or in war if be so levied as to distribute the burden as equally as possible among the|republic|of|texas have make know desire to come into union to form a part of confederacy and enjoy with the blessing of liberty secure and guarantee by constitution texas be once a part of country be unwisely cede away to a foreign power be now independent and possess an undoubted right to dispose of a part or the whole of territory and to merge sovereignty as a separate and independent state in our congratulate country that by an act of the late congress of the|united|state the assent of this government have be give to the reunion and only remain for the country to agree upon the term to consummate an object so important to both regard the question of annexation as belong exclusively to the|united|states and texas be independent power competent to contract and foreign nation have no right to interfere with or to take exception to reunion foreign power do not seem to appreciate the true character of government our|union be a confederation of independent state whose policy be peace with each other and all the world to enlarge limit be to extend the dominion of peace over additional territory and increase million the world have nothing to fear from military ambition in government while the chief magistrate and the popular branch of congress be elect for short term by the suffrage of those million who must in own person bear all the burden and misery of war government can not be otherwise than pacific foreign power should therefore look on the annexation of texas to the|united|states not as the conquest of a nation seek to extend dominion by arm and violence but as the peaceful acquisition of a territory once own by add another member to confederation with the consent of that member thereby diminish the chance of war and opening to new and ever increase market for product to texas the reunion be important because the strong protect arm of government would be extend over and the vast resource of fertile soil and genial climate would be speedily develop while the safety of and of whole southwestern frontier against hostile aggression as well as the interest of the whole union would be promote by in the early stage of national existence the opinion prevail with some that system of confederate state could not operate successfully over an extended territory and serious objection have at different time be make to the enlargement of boundary these objection be earnestly urge when acquire louisiana experience have show that be not well found the title of numerous indian tribe to vast tract of country have be extinguish new state have be admit into the union new territory have be create and jurisdiction and law extend over as population have expand the union have be cement and strengthen as boundary have be enlarge and agricultural population have be spread over a large surface federative system have acquire additional strength and security may well be doubt whether would not be in great danger of overthrow if present population be confine to the comparatively narrow limit of the original state than be now that be sparsely settle over a more expand territory be confidently believe that system may be safely extend to the utmost bound of territorial limit and that as shall be extend the bond of union so far from be weaken will become strong none can fail to see the danger to safety and future peace if texas remain an independent state or become an ally or dependency of some foreign nation more powerful than be there among citizen who would not prefer perpetual peace with texas to occasional war which so often occur between border independent nation be there who would not prefer free intercourse with to high duty on all product and manufacture which enter port or cross frontier be there who would not prefer an unrestricted communication with citizen to the frontier obstruction which must occur if remain out of the union whatever be good or evil in the local institution of texas will remain own whether annex to the|united|state or not none of the present state will be responsible for any more than be for the local institution of each other have confederate together for certain specified object upon the same principle that would refuse to form a perpetual union with texas because of local institution forefather would have be prevent from form present union perceive no valid objection to the measure and many reason for adoption vitally affect the peace the safety and the prosperity of both country shall on the broad principle which form the basis and produce the adoption of constitution and not in any narrow spirit of sectional policy endeavor by all constitutional honorable and appropriate mean to consummate the express will of the people and government of the|united|state by the reannexation of texas to union at the early practicable period nor will become in a less degree duty to assert and maintain by all constitutional mean the right of the|united|state to that portion of territory which lie beyond

the official connection of such default officer with the government although in country the chief magistrate must almost of necessity be choose by a party and stand pledge to principle and measure yet in official action should not be the president of a part only but of the whole people of the|united|state while execute the law with an impartial hand shrink from no proper responsibility and faithfully carry out in the executive department of the government the principle and policy of those who have choose should not be unmindful that fellow citizen who have differ with in opinion be entitle to the full and free exercise of opinion and judgment and that the right of all be entitle to respect and regard confidently rely upon the aid and assistance of the coordinate department of the government in conduct public affair enter upon the discharge of the high duty which have be assign by the people again humbly supplicate that divine|bee who have watch over and protect beloved country from infancy to the|present|hour to continue gracious benediction upon that may continue to be a prosperous and happy people transcript to the senate and house|of|representatif of the|united|state transmit herewith for the information of congress copy of certain dispatch recently receive from mr. wise envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary at the|court|of|brazil upon the subject of the slave trade develop the mean use and the device resort to hi order to evade exist enactment upon that subject anxiously desirous as be the|united|state to suppress a traffic so revolt to humanity in the effort to accomplish which have be the pioneer of civilized state can not but be a subject of the most profound regret that any portion of citizen should be find act in cooperation with the subject of other power in opposition to the policy of own government thereby subject to suspicion and to the hazard of disgrace the flag of own country be true that this traffic be carry on altogether in foreign part and that own coast be free from pollution but the crime remain the same wherever perpetrate and there be many circumstance to warrant the belief that some of citizen be deeply involved in guilt the mode and manner of carry on this trade be clearly and fearlessly set forth in the accompany document and would seem that a regular system have be adopt for the purpose of thwart the policy and evade the penalty of law american vessel with the knowledge as there be good reason to believe of the owner and master be charter or rather purchase by notorious slave dealer in brazil aid by english broker and capitalist with this intent the vessel be only nominally charter at while in truth be actually sell to be deliver on the coast of africa the charter party bind the owner in the meantime to take on board as passenger a new crew in brazil who when deliver on the coast be to navigate back to the port of brazil with cargo of slave under this agreement the vessel clear from the|united|state for some port in great|britain where a cargo of merchandise know as coast good and design especially for the african trade be purchase ship and consign together with the vessel either directly to the slave dealer or to agent or accomplice in brazil on arrival a new crew be put on board as passenger and the vessel and cargo consign to an equally guilty factor or agent on the coast of africa where the unlawful purpose originally design be finally consummate the merchandise be exchange for slave the vessel be deliver up name obliterate paper destroy american crew discharge to be provide for by the charter and the new or passenger crew put in command to carry back miserable freight to the first contriver of the voyage or employee in brazil during the whole progress of this tortuous enterprise be possible that neither the american crew originally enlist nor the passenger crew put on board in the brazilian port be aware of the nature of the voyage and yet be on these principally ignorant if not innocent that the penalty of the law be inflict while the guilty contriver the charterer broker owner and master in short all who be most deeply concerned in the crime and reward for the most part escape unpunished will be see from the examination which have recently take place at rio that the subject of her|britannic|majesty as well as own citizen be deeply implicate in this inhuman traffic british factor and agent while supply africa with british fabric in exchange for slave be chiefly instrumental in the abuse of the american flag and the suggestion contain in the letter of mr. wise whose judicious and zealous effort in the matter can not be too highly commend address to mr. hamilton the british envoy as to the good mode of suppress the evil deserve most deliberate consideration as will receive doubt not that of the|british|government be also worthy of consideration whether any other measure than those now exist be necessary to give great efficacy to the just and humane policy of law which already provide for the restoration to africa of slave capture at sea by american cruiser from time to time provision have be make by this government for comfortable support and maintenance during a limited period after restoration and be much to be regret that this liberal policy have not be adopt by great|britain as be seem to that the policy have adopt be calculate rather to perpetuate than to suppress the trade by enlist very large interest in favor merchant and capitalist furnish the mean of carry on manufacture for which the negroes be exchange be the product of workshop the slave when capture instead of be return back to home be transfer to colonial possession in the|west|indy and make the mean of swell the amount of product by a system of apprenticeship for a|term|of|year and the officer and crew who capture the vessel receive on the whole number of slave so many pound sterling per capita by way of bounty must be obvious that while these large interest be enlist in favor of continuance will be difficult if not impossible to suppress the nefarious traffic and that result would be in effect but a continuance of the slave trade in another and more cruel form for can be but a matter of little difference to the african whether be tear from country and transport to the|west|indy as a slave in the regular course of the trade or capture a cruiser transfer to the same place and make to perform the same labor under the name of an apprentice which be at present the practical operation of the policy adopt be to be hope that britannic majesty 's government will upon a review of all the circumstance state in these dispatch adopt more efficient measure for the suppression of the trade which have so long attempt to put down with as yet so little success and more consonant with the original policy of restore the capture african to home transcript to the senate and house|of|representatif transmit herewith copy of dispatch receive from minister at mexico since the commencement of present session which claim from importance and doubt not will receive calm and deliberate consideration the extraordinary and highly offensive language which the|mexican|government have think proper to employ in reply to the remonstrance of the executive through mr. shannon against the renewal of the war with texas while the question of annexation be pende before congress and the people and also the propose manner of conduct that war will not fail to arrest attention such remonstrance urge in no unfriendly spirit to mexico be call for by consideration of an imperative character have relation as well to the peace of this country and honor of this government as to the cause of humanity and civilization texas have enter into the treaty of annexation upon the invitation of the executive and when for that act be threaten with a renewal of the war on the part of mexico naturally look to this government to interpose effort to ward off the threaten blow but course be leave the executive act within the limit of constitutional competency and that be to pro test in respectful but at the same time strong and decide term against the war thus threaten to be renew be promulgate by edict and decree which order on the part of the mexican military the desolation of whole tract of country and the destruction without discrimination of all age sex and condition of existence over the manner of conduct war mexico possess no exclusive control have no right to violate at pleasure the principle which an enlighten civilization have lay down for the conduct of nation at war and thereby retrograde to a period of barbarism which happily for the world have long since pass away all nation be interested in enforce an observance of those principle and the|united|state the old of the|american|republic and the near of the civilized power to the theater on which these enormity be propose to be enact could not quietly content to witness such a state of thing have through the executive on another occasion and as be believe with the approbation of the whole country remonstrate against outrage similar but even less inhuman than those which by new edict and decree have threaten to perpetrate and of which the late inhuman massacre at tabasco be but the precursor the bloody and inhuman murder of fannin and companion equal only in savage barbarity by the usage of the untutored indian tribe prove how little confidence could be place on the most solemn stipulation of general while the fate of other who become captive in war many of whom no longer able to sustain the fatigue and privation of long journey be shoot down by the wayside while companion who survive be subject to suffering even more painful than death have leave an indelible stain on the page of civilization the executive with the evidence of an intention on the part of mexico to renew scene so revolt to humanity could do no less than renew remonstrance formerly urge for fulfil duty so imperative mexico have think proper through accredited organ because have have represent to the inhumanity of such proceeding to indulge in language unknown to the courtesy of diplomatic intercourse and offensive in the high degree to this government and people nor have offend in this only have not only violate exist convention between the country by arbitrary and unjust decree against trade and intercourse but withhold installment of debt due to citizen which solemnly pledge to pay under circumstance which be fully explain by the accompanying letter from mr. green secretary of legation and when minister have invite the attention of government to wrong commit by local authority not only on the property but on the person of fellow citizen engage in prosecute fair and honest pursuit have add insult to injury by not even deign for month together to return an answer to representation still further to manifest unfriendly feeling toward the|united|state have issue decree expel from some of provinces|american citizen engage in the peaceful pursuit of life and now deny to those of citizen prosecute the whale fishery on the northwest coast of the pacific the privilege which have through all time heretofore be accord to of exchange good of a small amount in value at port in california for supply indispensable to health and comfort nor will escape the observation of congress that in conduct a correspondence with a minister of the|united|state who can not and do not know any distinction between the geographical section of the union charge wholly unfounded be make against particular states and an appeal to other for aid and protection against suppose wrong in this same connection sectional prejudice be attempt to be excite and the hazardous and unpardonable effort be make to foment division amongst the|state of the union and thereby imbitter peace mexico have still to learn that however freely may indulge in discussion among the american people will tolerate no interference in domestic affair by any foreign government and in all that concern the constitutional guaranty and the national honor the people of the|united|state have but mind and heart the subject of annexation address most fortunately to every portion of the union the executive would have be unmindful of high obligation if could have adopt a course of policy dictate by sectional interest and local feeling on the contrary be because the question be neither local nor sectional but make appeal to the interest of the whole union and of every state in the union that the negotiation and finally the treaty of annexation be enter into and have afford no ordinary pleasure to perceive that so far as demonstration have be make upon by the people have proceed from all portion of the union mexico may seek to excite division amongst by utter unjust denunciation against particular states but when come to know that the invitation address to fellow citizen by spain and afterwards by to settle texas be accept by emigrant from all the states and when in addition to this refresh recollection with the fact that the first effort which be make to acquire texas be during the administration of a distinguished citizen from an eastern|state which be afterwards renew under the auspex of a president from the southwest will awake to a knowledge of the futility of present purpose of sow dissension among or produce distraction in council by attach either on particular states or on person who be now in the retirement of private life consider the appeal which now make to eminent citizen by name can hope to escape censure for have ascribe to as well as to other a design as pretend now for the first time reveal of have originate negotiation to despoil by duplicity and falsehood of a portion of territory the opinion then as now prevail with the executive that the annexation of texas to the union be a matter of vast importance in order to acquire that territory before have assume a position among the independent power of the earth proposition be make to mexico for a cession of to the|united|state mexico see in these proceeding at the time no cause of complaint be now when simply remind of awaken to the knowledge of the fact which through secretary of state promulgate to the whole world as true that those negotiation be found in deception and falsehood and superinduce by unjust and iniquitous motif while texas be a dependency of mexico the|united|state open negotiation with the latter power for the cession of then acknowledge territory and now that texas be independent of mexico and have maintain a separate existence for nine|year during which time have be receive into the family of nation and be represent by accredited ambassador at many of the principal courts|of|europe and when have become obvious to the whole world that be forever lose to mexico the|united|states be charge with deception and falsehood in all relate to the past and condemnatory accusation be make against states which have have no special agency in the matter because the executive of the whole union have negotiate with free and independent texas upon a matter vitally important to the interest of both country and after nine|year of unavaile war mexico now announce intention through secretary of foreign affair never to consent to the independence of texas or to abandon the effort to reconquer that republic thus announce a perpetual claim which at the|end|of|a|century will furnish as plausible a ground for discontent against any nation which at the end of that time may enter into a treaty with texas as possess at this moment against the|united|state the lapse of time can add nothing to title to independence a course of conduct such as have be describe on the part of mexico in violation of all friendly feeling and of the courtesy which should characterize the intercourse between the nation of the earth may well justify the|united|state in a resort to any measure to vindicate national honor but actuate by a sincere desire to preserve the general peace and in view of the present condition of mexico the executive rest upon integrity and not fear but that the judgment of the world will duly appreciate motif abstain from recommend to congress a resort to measure of redress and content with reurge upon that body prompt and immediate action on the subject of annexation by adopt that measure the|united|state will be in the exercise of an undoubted right and if mexico not regard forbearance shall aggravate the injustice of conduct by a declaration of war against upon head will rest all the responsibility transcript to the senate and house|of|representatif of the|united|state have continue cause for express gratitude to the|supreme|ruler|of|the|universe for the benefit and blessing which country under kind providence have enjoy during the|past|year notwithstanding the exciting scene through which have pass nothing have occur to disturb the general peace or to derange the harmony of political system the great moral spectacle have be exhibit of a nation approximate in number to people have perform the high and important function of elect chief magistrate for the term of four|year without the commission of any act of violence or the manifestation of a spirit of insubordination to the law the great and inestimable right of suffrage have be exercise by all who be invest with under the law of the different states in a spirit dictate alone by a desire in the selection of the agent to advance the interest of the country and to place beyond jeopardy the institution under which be happiness to live that the deep interest have be manifest by all countryman in the result of the election be not less true than highly creditable to vast multitude have assemble from time to time at various place for the purpose of canvass the merit and pretension of those who be present for suffrage but no armed soldiery have be necessary to restrain within proper limit the popular zeal or to prevent violent outbreak a principle much more controlling be find in the love of order and obedience to the law which with mere individual exception everywhere possess the american mind and control with an influence far more powerful than host of armed man can not dwell upon this picture without recognize in that deep and devoted attachment on the part of the people to the institution under which live which proclaim perpetuity the great objection which have always prevail against the election by the people of chief executive officer have be the apprehension of tumult and disorder which may involve in ruin the entire government a security against this be find not only in the fact before allude to but in the additional fact that live under a confederacy embrace already six|state no one of which have power to control the election the popular vote in each state be take at the time appoint by the law and such vote be announce by the electoral college without reference to the decision of other states the right of suffrage and the mode of conduct the election be regulate by the law of each state and the election be distinctly federative in all prominent feature thus be that unlike what may be the result under a consolidated system riotous proceeding should prevail could only affect the election in single states without disturb to any dangerous extent the tranquillity of other the great experiment of a political confederation each member of which be supreme as to all matter appertain to local interest and internal peace and happiness while by a voluntary compact with other confide to the united power of all the protection of citizen in matter not domestic have be so far crown with complete success the world have witness rapid growth in wealth and population and under the guide and direction of a superintend providence the development of the past may be regard but as the shadow forth of the mighty future in the bright prospect of that future shall find as patriot and philanthropist the high inducement to cultivate and cherish a love of union and to frown down every measure or effort which may be make to alienate the states or the people of the states in sentiment and feeling from each other a rigid and close adherence to the term of political compact and above all a sacred observance of the guaranty of the constitution will preserve union on a foundation which can not be shake while personal liberty be place beyond hazard or jeopardy the guaranty of religious freedom of the freedom of the press of the liberty of speech of the trial by jury of the habeas corpus and of the domestic institution of each of the states leave the private citizen in the full exercise of the high and ennoble attribute of nature and to each state the privilege which can only be judiciously exert by of consult the mean best calculate to advance own happiness these be the great and important guaranty of the constitution which the lover of liberty must cherish and the advocate of union must ever cultivate preserve these and avoid all interpolation by force construction under the guise of an imagine expediency upon the constitution the influence of political system be destine to be as actively and as beneficially feel on the distant shore of the pacific as be now on those of the|atlantic|ocean the only formidable impediment in the way of successful expansion time and space be so far in the progress of modification by the improvement of the age as to render no longer speculative the ability of representative from that remote region to come up to the capitol so that constituent shall participate in all the benefit of federal legislation thus be that in the progress of time the inestimable principle of civil liberty will be enjoy by million yet unborn and the great benefit of system of government be extend to now distant and uninhabited region in view of the vast wilderness yet to be reclaim may well invite the lover of freedom of every land to take up abode among and assist in the great work of advance the standard of civilization and give a wide spread to the art and refinement of cultivate life prayer should evermore be offer up to for wisdom to direct in the path of duty so as to enable to consummate these high purpose of the strong objection which have be urge against confederacy by writer on government be the liability of the member to be tamper with by foreign government or the people of foreign state either in local affair or in such as affect the peace of other or endanger the safety of the whole confederacy can not hope to be entirely exempt from such attempt on peace and safety the|united|state be become too important in population and resource not to attract the observation of other nation therefore may in the progress of time occur that opinion entirely abstract in the states which may prevail and in no degree affect domestic institution may be artfully but secretly encouraged with a view to undermine the union such opinion may become the foundation of political party until at last the conflict of opinion produce an alienation of friendly feeling among the people of the different states may involve in general destruction the happy institution under which live should ever be bear in mind that what be true in regard to individual be equally so in regard to state an interference of in the affair of another be the fruitful cause of family dissension and neighborhood dispute and the same cause affect the peace happiness and prosperity of state may be most devoutly hope that the good sense of the american people will ever be ready to repel all such attempt should ever be make there have be no material change in foreign relation since last annual message to congress with all the power of europe continue on the most friendly term indeed afford much satisfaction to state that at no former period have the peace of that enlighten and important quarter of the globe ever be apparently more firmly establish the conviction that peace be the true policy of nation would seem to be grow and become deeper amongst the enlighten everywhere and there be no people who have a strong interest in cherish the sentiment and adopt the mean of preserve and give permanence than those of the|united|state amongst these the first and most effective be no doubt the strict observance of justice and the honest and punctual fulfillment of all engagement but be not to be forget that in the present state of the world be no less necessary to be ready to enforce observance and fulfillment in reference to than to observe and fulfill on part in regard to other since the close of last session a negotiation have be formally enter upon between the secretary of state and her|britannic|majesty 's minister plenipotentiary and envoy extraordinary residing at washington relative to the right of respective nation in and over that negotiation be still pende should during session be bring to a definitive conclusion the result will be promptly communicate to congress would however again call attention to the recommendation contain in previous message design to protect and facilitate emigration to that territory the establishment of military post at suitable point upon the extended line of land travel would enable citizen to emigrate in comparative safety to the fertile region below the|falls|of|the|columbia and make the provision of the exist convention for the joint occupation of the territory by subject of great|britain and the citizen of the|united|state more available than heretofore to the latter these post would constitute place of rest for the weary emigrant where would be shelter securely against the danger of attack from the indians and be enable to recover from the exhaustion of a long line of travel legislative enactment should also be make which should spread over the aegis of law so as to afford protection to person and property when shall have reach distant home in this latter respect have be much more careful of the interest of such of people as be to be find in that country than the|united|state have make necessary provision for security and protection against the act of the viciously dispose and lawless and emigrant repose in safety under the panoply of law whatever may be the result of the pende negotiation such measure be necessary will afford the great pleasure to witness a happy and favorable termination to the exist negotiation upon term compatible with the public honor and the good effort of the government will continue to be direct to this end would have give the high gratification in this last annual communication to congress to have be able to announce to the complete and entire settlement and adjustment of other matter in difference between the|united|state and the|government|of|her|britannic|majesty which be advert to in a previous message be so obviously the interest of both country in respect to the large and valuable commerce which exist between that all cause of complaint however inconsiderable should be with the great promptitude remove that must be regard as cause of regret that any unnecessary delay should be permit to intervene be true that in a pecuniary point of view the matter allude to be altogether insignificant in amount when compare with the ample resource of that great nation but nevertheless more particularly that limited class which arise under seizure and detention of american ship on the coast of africa upon the mistaken supposition indulge in at the time the wrong be commit of be engage in the slave trade deeply affect the sensibility of this government and people great|britain have recognize responsibility to repair all such wrong by action in other case leave nothing to be regret upon the subject and to all case arise prior to the treaty of washington than the delay in make suitable reparation in such of as fall plainly within the principle of other which have long since adjust the injury inflict by delay in the settlement of these claim fall with severity upon the individual claimant and make a strong appeal to magnanimity and sense of justice for a speedy settlement other matter arise out of the construction of exist treaty also remain unadjusted and will continue to be urge upon attention the labor of the joint commission appoint by the government to run the dividing line establish by the treaty of washington be unfortunately much delay in the commencement of the season by the failure of congress at last session to make a timely appropriation of fund to meet the expense of the american party and by other cause the|united|states commissioner however express expectation that by increase diligence and energy the party will be able to make up for lose time continue to receive assurance of the most friendly feeling on the part of all the other european power with each and all of whom be so obviously interest to cultivate the most amicable relation nor can anticipate the occurrence of any event which would be likely in any degree to disturb those relation russia the great northern power under the judicious sway of emperor be constantly advance in the road of science and improvement while france guide by the counsel of wise sovereign pursue a course calculate to consolidate the general peace spain have obtain a breathing spell of some duration from the internal convulsion which have through so many year mar prosperity while austria the|netherlands prussia belgium and the other power of europe reap a rich harvest of blessing from the prevail peace inform the houses|of|congress in message of december last that instruction have be give to mr. wheaton minister at berlin to negotiate a treaty with the germanic|states compose the zollverein if could be do stipulate as far as be practicable to accomplish for a reduction of the heavy and onerous duty levy on tobacco and other lead article of agricultural production and yield in return on part a reduction of duty on such article the product of industry as should not come into competition or but a limited one with article the product of manufacturing industry the executive in give such instruction consider as act in strict conformity with the wish of congress as make known through several measure which have adopt all direct to the accomplishment of this important result the treaty be therefore negotiate by which essential reduction be secure in the duty levy by the zollverein on tobacco rice and lard accompany by a stipulation for the admission of raw cotton free of duty in exchange for which highly important concession a reduction of duty impose by the law of the|united|state on a variety of article most of which be admit free of all duty under the act of congress commonly know as the compromise law and but few of which be produce in the|united|state be stipulate for on part this treaty be communicate to the senate at an|early|day of last session but not act upon until near close when for the want as be bind to presume of full time to consider be lay upon the table this procedure have the effect of virtually reject in consequence of a stipulation contain in the treaty that ratification should be exchange on or before a day which have already pass the executive act upon the fair inference that the senate do not intend absolute rejection give instruction to minister at berlin to reopen the negotiation so far as to obtain an extension of time for the exchange of ratification regret however to say that effort in this respect have be unsuccessful be nevertheless not without hope that the great advantage which be intend to be secure by the treaty may yet be realize be happy to inform that belgium have by an arrete royale issue in july last assimilate the flag of the|united|state to own so far as the direct trade between the country be concern this measure will prove of great service to shipping interest the trade have heretofore be carry on chiefly in foreign bottom flatter that will speedily resort to a modification of system relate to the tobacco trade which would decidedly benefit the agriculture of the|united|state and operate to the mutual advantage of both country no definitive intelligence have yet be receive from minister of the conclusion of a treaty with the|chinese|empire but enough be know to induce the strong hope that the mission will be crown with success with brazil relation continue on the most friendly footing the commercial intercourse between that grow empire and the|united|state be become daily of great importance to both and be to the interest of both that the firm relation of amity and good will should continue to be cultivate between the|republic|of|new|granada still withhold notwithstanding the most persevering effort have be employ by charge d'affaires mr. blackford to produce a different result indemnity in the case of the brig morris and the congress of venezuela although an arrangement have be effect between minister and the minister of foreign affair of that government for the payment of in discharge of liability in the same case have altogether neglect to make provision for payment be to be hope that a sense of justice will soon induce a settlement of these claim late minister to chili mr. pendleton have return to the|united|state without have effect an adjustment in the second claim of the macedonian which be delay on ground altogether frivolous and untenable mr. pendleton 's successor have be direct to urge the claim in the strong term and in the event of a failure to obtain a prompt adjustment to report the fact to the executive at as|early|a|day as possible so that the whole matter may be communicate to congress at last session submit to the attention of congress the convention with the|republic|of|peru of the|17th|march,|1841 provide for the adjustment of the claim of citizen of the|united|state against that republic but no definitive action be take upon the subject again invite to attention and prompt action in last annual message feel to be duty to make known to congress in term both plain and emphatic opinion in regard to the war which have so long exist between mexico and texas which since the battle of san|jacinto have consist altogether of predatory incursion attend by circumstance revolt to humanity repeat now what then say that after eight|year of feeble and ineffectual effort to reconquer texas be time that the war should have cease the|united|state have a direct interest in the question the contiguity of the nation to territory be but too well calculated to involve peace unjust suspicion be engender in the mind of or the other of the belligerent against and as a necessary consequence american interest be make to suffer and peace become daily endanger in addition to which must have be obvious to all that the exhaustion produce by the war subject both mexico and texas to the interference of other power which without the interposition of this government may eventuate in the most serious injury to the|united|state this government from time to time exert friendly office to bring about a termination of hostility upon term honorable alike to both the belligerent effort in this behalf prove unavaile mexico seem almost without an object to persevere in the war and no other alternative be leave the executive but to take advantage of the well know disposition of texas and to invite to enter into a treaty for annex territory to that of since last session mexico have threaten to renew the war and have either make or propose to make formidable preparation for invade texas have issue decree and proclamation preparatory to the commencement of hostility full of threat revolt to humanity and which if carry into effect would arouse the attention of all christendom this new demonstration of feeling there be too much reason to believe have be produce in consequence of the negotiation of the late treaty of annexation with texas the executive therefore could not be indifferent to such proceeding and feel to be due as well to as to the honor of the country that a strong representation should be make to the|mexican|government upon the subject this be accordingly do as will be see by the copy of the accompanying dispatch from the secretary of state to the united|states envoy at mexico mexico have no right to jeopard the peace of the world by urge any longer a useless and fruitless contest such a condition of thing would not be tolerate on the european continent why should be on this a war of desolation such as be now threaten by mexico can not be wag without involve peace and tranquillity be idle to believe that such a war could be look upon with indifference by own citizen inhabit adjoin states and neutrality would be violate in despite of all effort on the part of the government to prevent the country be settle by emigrant from the|united|state under invitation hold out to by spain and mexico those emigrant have leave behind friend and relative who would not fail to sympathize with in difficulty and who would be lead by those sympathy to participate in struggle however energetic the action of the government to prevent nor would the numerous and formidable band of indians the most warlike to be find in any land which occupy the extensive region contiguous to the|state of arkansas and missouri and who be in possession of large tract of country within the limit of texas be likely to remain passive the inclination of those numerous tribe lead invariably to war whenever pretext exist mexico have no just ground of displeasure against this government or people for negotiate the treaty what interest of her be affect by the treaty be despoil of nothing since texas be forever lose to the independence of texas be recognize by several of the lead power of the earth be free to treat free to adopt own line of policy free to take the course which believe be best calculate to secure happiness government and people decide on annexation to the|united|state and the executive see in the acquisition of such a territory the mean of advance permanent happiness and glory what principle of good faith then be violate what rule of political moral trample under foot so far as mexico be concern the measure should have be regard by as highly beneficial inability to reconquer texas have be exhibit repeat by now nine)|year of fruitless and ruinous contest in the meantime texas have be grow in population and resource emigration have flow into territory from all part of the world in a current which continue to increase in strength mexico require a permanent boundary between that young republic and texas at no distant day if continue separate and detach from the|united|state will inevitably seek to consolidate strength by add to domain the contiguous provinces|of|mexico the spirit of revolt from the control of the central government have heretofore manifest in some of those provinces and be fair to infer that would be incline to take the first favorable opportunity to proclaim independence and to form close alliance with texas the war would thus be endless or if cessation of hostility should occur would only endure for a season the interest of mexico therefore could in nothing be better consult than in a peace with neighbor which would result in the establishment of a permanent boundary upon the ratification of the treaty the executive be prepared to treat with on the most liberal basis hence the boundary of texas be leave undefined by the treaty the executive propose to settle these upon term that all the world should have pronounce just and reasonable no negotiation upon that point could have be undertake between the|united|state and mexico in advance of the ratification of the treaty should have have no right no power no authority to have conduct such a negotiation and to have undertake would have be an assumption equally revolt to the pride of mexico and texas and subject to the charge of arrogance while to have propose in advance of annexation to satisfy mexico for any contingent interest may have in texas would have be to have treat texas not as an independent power but as a mere dependency of mexico this assumption could not have be act on by the executive without set at defiance own solemn declaration that that republic be an independent state mexico have be true threaten war against the|united|state in the event the treaty of annexation be ratified the executive could not permit to be influence by this threat represent in this the spirit of people who be ready to sacrifice much for peace but nothing to intimidation a war under any circumstance be greatly to be deplore and the|united|state be the last nation to desire but if as the condition of peace be require of to forego the unquestionable right of treat with an independent power of own continent upon matter highly interesting to both and that upon a naked and unsustained pretension of claim by a third power to control the free will of the power with whom treat devote as may be to peace and anxious to cultivate friendly relation with the whole world the executive do not hesitate to say that the people of the|united|state would be ready to brave all consequence sooner than submit to such condition but no apprehension of war be entertain by the executive and must express frankly the opinion that have the treaty be ratify by the senate would have be follow by a prompt settlement to the entire satisfaction of mexico of every matter in difference between the country see then that new preparation for hostile invasion of texas be about to be adopt by mexico and that these be bring about because texas have adopt the suggestion of the executive upon the subject of annexation could not passively have fold arm and permit a war threaten to be accompany by every act that could mark a barbarous age to be wag against because have do so other consideration of a control character influence the course of the executive the treaty which have thus be negotiate have fail to receive the ratification of the senate of the chief objection which be urge against be find to consist in the fact that the question of annexation have not be submit to the ordeal of public opinion in the|united|state however untenable such an objection be esteem to be in view of the unquestionable power of the executive to negotiate the treaty and the great and last interest involve in the question feel to be duty to submit the whole subject to congress as the good expounder of popular sentiment no definitive action have be take on the subject by congress the question refer directly to the decision of the states and people the great popular election which have just terminate afford the good opportunity of ascertain the will of the states and the people upon pende that issue become the imperative duty of the executive to inform mexico that the question of annexation be still before the american people and that until decision be pronounce any serious invasion of texas would be regard as an attempt to forestall judgment and could not be look upon with indifference be most happy to inform that no such invasion have take place and trust that whatever action may be upon mexico will see the importance of decide the matter by a resort to peaceful expedient in preference to those of arm the decision of the people and the states on this great and interesting subject have be decisively manifest the question of annexation have be present nakedly to consideration by the treaty all collateral and incidental issue which be calculate to divide and distract the public council be carefully avoid these be leave to the wisdom of the future to determine present repeat the isolated question of annexation and in that form have be submit to the ordeal of public sentiment a control majority of the people and a large majority of the states have declare in favor of immediate annexation instruction have thus come up to both branch of congress from respective constituent in term the most emphatic be the will of both the people and the states that texas shall be annex to the union promptly and immediately may be hope that in carry into execution the public will thus declare all collateral issue may be avoid future legislature can best decide as to the number of states which should be form out of the territory when the time have arrive for decide that question so with all other by the treaty the|united|state assume the payment of the debt of texas to an amount not exceed to be pay with the exception of a sum fall short of exclusively out of the proceed of the sale of public land could not with honor take the land without assume the full payment of all incumbency upon nothing have occur since last session to induce a doubt that the disposition of texas remain unaltered no intimation of an altered determination on the part of government and people have be furnish to the executive still desire to throw under the protection of law and to partake of the blessing of federative system while every american interest would seem to require the extension of coastwise and foreign trade to an amount almost incalculable the enlargement of the market for manufacture a constantly grow market for agricultural production safety to frontier and additional strength and stability to the union these be the result which would rapidly develop upon the consummation of the measure of annexation in such event will not doubt but that mexico would find true interest to consist in meet the advance of this government in a spirit of amity nor do apprehend any serious complaint from any|other|quarter no sufficient ground exist for such complaint should interfere in no respect with the right of any other nation there can not be gather from the act any design on part to do so with possession on this continent have interpose no impediment in the way of such acquisition of territory large and extensive as many of be as the lead power of europe have make from time to time in every part of the world seek no conquest make by war no intrigue will have be resort to or act of diplomacy essay to accomplish the annexation of texas free and independent ask to be receive into union be a question for own decision whether shall be receive or not the government have already agree through respective organ on the term of annexation would recommend adoption by congress in the form of a joint resolution or act to be perfect and make bind on the country when adopt in like manner by the government|of|texas in order that the subject may be fully present in all bearing the correspondence which have take place in reference to since the adjournment of congress between the|united|state texas and mexico be herewith transmit the amendment propose by the senate to the convention conclude between the|united|state and mexico on the|20th|of|november,|1843 have be transmit through minister for the concurrence of the|mexican|government but although urge thereto no action have yet be have on the subject nor have any answer be give which would authorize a favorable conclusion in the future the decree of september,|1843 in relation to the retail trade the order for the expulsion of foreigner and that of a more recent date in regard to passport all which be consider as in violation of the treaty of amity and commerce between the country have lead to a correspondence of considerable length between the minister for foreign relation and representative at mexico but without any satisfactory result remain still unadjusted and many and serious inconvenience have already result to citizen in consequence of question grow out of the act of disarm a body of texan troop under the command of major snively by an officer in the service of the|united|state act under the order of government and the forcible entry into the custom house at bryarlys|landing on by certain citizen of the|united|state and take away therefrom the good seize by the collector of the custom as forfeit under the law of texas have be adjust so far as the power of the executive extend the correspondence between the government in reference to both subject will be find amongst the accompany document contain a full statement of all the fact and circumstance with the view take on both side and the principle on which the question have be adjust remain for congress to make the necessary appropriation to carry the arrangement into effect which respectfully recommend the greatly improve condition of the treasury afford a subject for general congratulation the paralysis which have fall on trade and commerce and which subject the government to the necessity of resort to loan and the issue of treasury note to a large amount have pass away and after the payment of upward of on account of the interest and in redemption of more|than|$5,000,000 of the public debt which fall due on the|1st|of|january next and set apart upward of for the payment of outstanding treasury note and meet an installment of the debt of the corporate city of the|district|of|columbia an estimated surplus of upward of over and above the exist appropriation will remain in the treasury at the close of the|fiscal|year should the treasury note continue outstanding as heretofore that surplus will be considerably augment although all interest have cease upon and the government have invite return to the treasury yet remain outstanding afford great facility to commerce and establish the fact that under a well regulated system of finance the government have resource within which render independent in time of need not only of private loan but also of bank facility the only remain subject of regret be that the remain stock of the government do not fall due at an early day since redemption would be entirely within control as be may be well worthy the consideration of congress whether the law establish the sinking fund under the operation of which the debt of the|revolution and last war with great|britain be to a great extent extinguish should not with proper modification so as to prevent an accumulation of surplus and limit in amount to a specific sum be reenact such provision which would authorize the government to go into the market for a purchase of own stock on fair term would serve to maintain credit at the high point and prevent to a great extent those fluctuation in the price of security which may under other circumstance affect credit no apprehension of this sort be at this moment entertain since the stock of the government which but two|years|ago be offer for sale to capitalist at home and abroad at a depreciation and could find no purchaser be now greatly above par in the hand of the holder but a wise and prudent forecast admonish to place beyond the reach of contingency the public credit must also be a matter of unmingled gratification that under the exist financial system rest upon the act of and the resolution of the currency of the country have attain a state of perfect soundness and the rate of exchange between different part of the union which in denote by enormous amount the great depreciation and in fact worthlessness of the currency in most of the states be now reduce to little more than the mere expense of transport specie from place to place and the risk incident to the operation in a new country like that of the|united|state where so many inducement be hold out for speculation the depository of the surplus revenue consist of bank of any description when reach any considerable amount require the close vigilance on the part of the government all banking institution under whatever denomination may pass be govern by an almost exclusive regard to the interest of the stockholder that interest consist in the augmentation of profit in the form of dividend and a large surplus revenue intrust to custody be but too apt to lead to excessive loan and to extravagantly large issue of paper as a necessary consequence price be nominally increase and the speculative mania very soon seize upon the public mind a fictitious state of prosperity for a season exist and in the language of the day money become plenty contract be enter into by individual rest on this unsubstantial state of thing but the delusion speedily pass away and the country be overrun with an indebtedness so weighty as to overwhelm many and to visit every department of industry with great and ruinous embarrassment the great vigilance become necessary on the part of government to guard against this state of thing the depository must be give distinctly to understand that the favor of the government will be altogether withdraw or substantially diminish if revenue shall be regard as addition to banking capital or as the foundation of an enlarged circulation the government through revenue have at all time an important part to perform in connection with the currency and greatly depend upon vigilance and care whether the country be involve in embarrassment similar to those which have have recently to encounter or aid by the action of the treasury shall be preserve in a sound and healthy condition the danger to be guard against be greatly augment by too large a surplus of revenue when that surplus greatly exceed in amount what shall be require by a wise and prudent forecast to meet unforeseen contingency the legislature may come to be seize with a disposition to indulge in extravagant appropriation to object many of which may and most probably would be find to conflict with the constitution a fancied expediency be elevate above constitutional authority and a reckless and wasteful extravagance but too certainly follow the important power of taxation which when exercise in most restricted form be a burthen on labor and production be resort to under various pretext for purpose have no affinity to the motif which dictate grant and the extravagance of government stimulate individual extravagance until the spirit of a wild and ill regulated speculation involve and all in unfortunate result in view of such fatal consequence may be lay down as an axiom round in moral and political truth that no great taxis should be impose than be necessary for an economical administration of the government and that whatever exist beyond should be reduce or modify this doctrine do in no way conflict with the exercise of a sound discrimination in the selection of the article to be tax which a due regard to the public weal would at all time suggest to the legislative mind leave the range of selection undefined and such selection should always be make with an eye to the great interest of the country compose as be the union of separate and independent states a patriotic legislature will not fail in consult the interest of the part to adopt such course as will be best calculate to advance the harmony of the whole and thus insure that permanency in the policy of the government without which all effort to advance the public prosperity be vain and fruitless this great and vitally important task rest with congress and the executive can do no more than recommend the general principle which should govern in execution refer to the report of the secretary of war for an exhibition of the condition of the army and recommend to as well worthy good consideration many of the suggestion contain the secretary in no degree exaggerate the great importance of press forward without delay in the work of erect and finish the fortification to which particularly allude much have be do toward place city and roadstead in a state of security against the hazard of hostile attack within the|last|four|years but consider the new element which have be of late|year employ in the propelling of ship and the formidable implement of destruction which have be bring into service can not be too active or vigilant in prepare and perfect the mean of defense refer also to report for a full statement of the condition of the indian tribe within jurisdiction the executive have abate no effort in carry into effect the well establish policy of the government which contemplate a removal of all the tribe reside within the limit of the several states beyond those limit and be now enable to congratulate the country at the prospect of an early consummation of this object many of the tribe have already make great progress in the art of civilized life and through the operation of the school establish among aid by the effort of the pious man of various religious denomination who devote to the task of improvement may fondly hope that the remain of the formidable tribe which be once master of this country will in transition from the savage state to a condition of refinement and cultivation add another bright trophy to adorn the labor of a well direct philanthropy the accompanying report of the secretary of the navy will explain to the situation of that branch of the service the present organization of the department impart to operation great efficiency but concur fully in the propriety of a division of and repairs into bureau the subject as now arrange be incongruous and require to a certain extent information and qualification altogether dissimilar the operation of the squadron on the coast of africa have be conduct with all due attention to the object which lead to origination and be happy to say that the officer and crew have enjoy the good possible health under the system adopt by the officer in command be believe that the|united|states be the only nation which have by law subject to the punishment of death as pirate those who may be engage in the slave trade a similar enactment on the part of other nation would not fail to be attend by beneficial result in consequence of the difficulty which have exist in the way of secure title for the necessary ground operation have not yet be commence toward the establishment of the navy yard at memphis so soon as the title be perfect no further delay will be permit to intervene be well worthy of consideration whether congress should not direct the establishment of a ropewalk in connection with the contemplate navy yard as a measure not only of economy but as highly useful and necessary the only establishment of the sort now connect with the service be locate at boston and the advantage of a similar establishment convenient to the hemp grow region must be apparent to all the report of the secretary present other matter to consideration of an important character in connection with the service in refer to the accompanying report of the|postmaster general afford continue cause of gratification to be able to advert to the fact that the affair of the|department|for|the last year have be so conduct as from unaided resource to meet large expenditure on coming into office a debt of exist against the department which congress discharge by an appropriation from the treasury the department on the 4th of march next will be find under the management of present efficient head free of debt or embarrassment which could only have be do by the observance and practice of the great vigilance and economy the law have contemplate throughout that the department should be self sustain but may become necessary with the wise regard to the public interest to introduce amendment and alteration in the system there be a strong desire manifest in many|quarters so to alter the tariff of letter postage as to reduce the amount of tax at present impose should such a measure be carry into effect to the full extent desire can not well be doubt but that for the|first|years of operation a diminished revenue would be collect the supply of which would necessarily constitute a charge upon the treasury whether such a result would be desirable will be for congress in wisdom to determine may in general be assert as true that radical alteration in any system should rather be bring about gradually than by sudden change and by pursue this prudent policy in the reduction of letter postage the department may still sustain through the revenue which would accrue by the increase of letter the state and condition of the public treasury have heretofore be such as to have preclude the recommendation of any material change the difficulty upon this head have however cease and a large discretion be now leave to the government can not too strongly urge the policy of authorize the establishment of a line of steamship regularly to ply between this country and foreign port and upon own water for the transportation of the mail the example of the|british|government be well worthy of imitation in this respect the belief be strongly entertain that the emolument arise from the transportation of mail matter to foreign country would operate of as an inducement to cause individual enterprise to undertake that branch of the task and the remuneration of the government would consist in the addition readily make to steam navy in case of emergency by the ship so employ should this suggestion meet approval the propriety of place such ship under the command of experienced officer of the navy will not escape observation the application of steam to the purpose of naval warfare cogently recommend an extensive steam marine as important in estimate the defense of the country fortunately this may be obtain by to a great extent without incur any large amount of expenditure steam vessel to be engage in the transportation of the mail on principal water course lake and port of coast could also be so construct as to be efficient as war vessel when need and would of constitute a formidable force in order to repel attack from abroad can not be blind to the fact that other nation have already add large number of steamship to naval armament and that this new and powerful agent be destine to revolutionize the condition of the world become the|united|state therefore look to security to adopt a similar policy and the plan suggest will enable to do so at a small comparative cost take the great pleasure in bear testimony to the zeal and untiring industry which have characterize the conduct of the member of the|executive|cabinet each in appropriate sphere have render the most efficient aid in carry on the government and will not trust appear out of place for to bear this public testimony the cardinal object which should ever be hold in view by those intrust with the administration of public affair be rigidly and without favor or affection so to interpret the national will express in the law as that injustice should be do to none justice to all this have be the rule upon which have act and thus be believe that few case if any exist wherein fellow citizen who from time to time have be draw to the seat of government for the settlement of transaction with the government have go away dissatisfied where the testimony have be perfect and be esteem satisfactory claim have be promptly audit and this in the absence of all favoritism or partiality the government which be not just to own people can neither claim affection nor the respect of the world at the same time the close attention have be pay to those matter which relate more immediately to the great concern of the country order and efficiency in each branch of the public service have prevail accompany by a system of the most rigid responsibility on the part of the receiving and disburse agent the fact in illustration of the truth of this remark deserve to be notice that the revenue of the government amount in the|last|four|years to upward of have be collect and disburse through the numerous governmental agent without the loss by default of any amount worthy of serious commentary the appropriation make by congress for the improvement of the river of the west and of the harbor on the lakes be in a course of judicious expenditure under suitable agent and be destine be to be hope to realize all the benefit design to be accomplish by congress can not however sufficiently impress upon congress the great importance of withholding appropriation from improvement which be not ascertain by previous examination and survey to be necessary for the shelter and protection of trade from the danger of store and tempest without this precaution the expenditure be but too apt to inure to the benefit of individual without reference to the only consideration which can render constitutional the public interest and the general good can not too earnestly urge upon the interest of this district over which by the|constitution|congress have exclusive jurisdiction would be deeply to be regret should there be at any time ground to complain of neglect on the part of a community which detach as be from the parental care of the|states|of|virginia and maryland can only expect aid from congress as local legislature amongst the subject which claim attention be the prompt organization of an asylum for the insane who may be find from time to time sojourn within the district such course be also demand by consideration which apply to branch of the public service for the necessity in this behalf invite particular attention to the report of the secretary of the navy have thus gentleman of the houses|of|congress present a true and faithful picture of the condition of public affair both foreign and domestic the want of the public service be make known to and matter of no ordinary importance be urge upon consideration shall not be permit to congratulate on the happy auspex under which have assemble and at the important change in the condition of thing which have occur in during that period question with foreign power of vital importance to the peace of country have be settle and adjust a desolate and waste war with savage tribe have be bring to a close the internal tranquillity of the country threaten by agitate question have be preserve the credit of the government which have experience a temporary embarrassment have be thoroughly restore coffer which for a|season be empty have be replenish a currency nearly uniform in value have take the place of depreciate and almost worthless commerce and manufacture which have suffer in common with every other interest have once more revive and the whole country exhibit an aspect of prosperity and happiness trade and barter no longer govern by a wild and speculative mania rest upon a solid and substantial footing and the rapid growth of city in every direction bespeak most strongly the favorable circumstance by which be surround happiness in the retirement which shortly await be the ardent hope which experience that this state of prosperity be neither deceptive nor destine to be short live and that measure which have not yet receive sanction but which can not but regard as closely connected with the honor the glory and still more enlarged prosperity of the country be destine at an|early|day to receive the approval of congress under these circumstance and with these anticipation shall most gladly leave to other more able than the noble and pleasing task of sustain the public prosperity shall carry with into retirement the gratify reflection that as sole object throughout have be to advance the public good may not entirely have fail in accomplish and this gratification be heighten in no small degree by the fact that when under a deep and abide sense of duty have find constrain to resort to the qualified veto have neither be follow by disapproval on the part of the people nor weaken in any degree attachment to that great conservative feature of government transcript to the|house|of|representatives of the|united|state return to the|house|of|representatives in which originate the bill entitle an act make appropriation for the improvement of certain harbor and river with the follow objection to become a law at the adoption of the constitution each state be possess of a separate and independent sovereignty and an exclusive jurisdiction over all stream and water course within territorial limit the|articles|of|confederation in no way affect this authority or jurisdiction and the present constitution adopt for the purpose of correct the defect which exist in the original articles expressly reserve to the states all power not delegate no such surrender of jurisdiction be make by the states to this government by any express grant and if be possess be to be deduce from the clause in the constitution which invest congress with authority to make all law which be necessary and proper for carry into execution the grant power there be in view of the subject no pretense whatever for the claim to power which the bill now return substantially set up the inferential power in order to be legitimate must be clearly and plainly incidental to some grant power and necessary to exercise to refer to the head of convenience or usefulness would be to throw open the door to a boundless and unlimited discretion and to invest congress with an unrestrained authority the power to remove obstruction from the water course of the states be claim under the grant power to regulate commerce with foreign nation among the several states and with the indian tribe but the plain and obvious meaning of this grant be that congress may adopt rule and regulation prescribe the term and condition on which the citizen of the|united|state may carry on commercial operation with foreign state or kingdom and on which the citizen or subject of foreign state or kingdom may prosecute trade with the|united|state or either of and so the power to regulate commerce among the several states no more invest congress with jurisdiction over the water course of the states than the first branch of the grant do over the water course of foreign power which would be an absurdity the right of common use of the people of the|united|state to the navigable water of each and every state arise from the express stipulation contain in the constitution that the citizen of each state shall be entitle to all privilege and immunity of citizen in the several states while therefore the navigation of any river in any state be by the law of such state allow to the citizen thereof the same be also secure by the|united|state on the same term and condition to the citizen of every other state and so of any other privilege or immunity the application of the revenue of this government if the power to do so be admit to improve the navigation of the river by remove obstruction or otherwise would be for the most part productive only of local benefit the consequence may prove disastrously ruinous to as many of fellow citizen as the exercise of such power would benefit will take instance furnish by the present bill out of no invidious feeling for such would be impossible for to feel but because of great familiarity with location in illustration of the above opinion twenty|thousand|dollar be propose to be appropriate toward improve the harbor of richmond in such improvement would furnish advantage to the city of richmond and add to the value of the property of citizen while may have a most disastrous influence over the wealth and prosperity of petersburg which be situate some|25|mile distant on a branch of james|river and which now enjoy fair portion of the trade so too the improvement of james|river to richmond and of the appomattox to petersburg may by invite the trade to those town have the effect of prostrate the town of norfolk this too may be accomplish without add a single vessel to the number now engage in the trade of the|chesapeake|bay or bring into the treasury a dollar of additional revenue would produce most probably the single effect of concentrate the commerce now profitably enjoy by place upon of this case furnish an apt illustration of the effect of this bill in several other particular there can not in fact be draw the slight discrimination between the improve the stream of a state under the power to regulate commerce and the most extended system of internal improvement on land the excavate a canal and pave a road be equally as much incident to such claim of power as the remove obstruction from water course nor can such power be restrict by any fair course of reason to the mere fact of make the improvement reasonably extend also to the right of seek a return of the mean expend through the exaction of toll and the levying of contribution thus while the constitution deny to this government the privilege of acquire a property in the soil of any state even for the purpose of erect a necessary fortification without a grant from such state this claim to power would invest with control and dominion over the water and soil of each state without restriction power so incongruous can not exist in the same instrument the bill be also liable to a serious objection because of blending appropriation for numerous object but few of which agree in general feature this necessarily produce the effect of embarrassing executive action some of the appropriation would receive sanction if separate from the rest however much may deplore the reproduction of a system which for some time past have be permit to sleep with apparently the acquiescence of the country may particularize the|delaware|breakwater as an improvement which look to the security from the storm of extended atlantic seaboard of the vessel of all the country engage either in the foreign or the coastwise trade as well as to the safety of the revenue but when in connection with that the same bill embrace improvement of river at point far in the interior connect alone with the trade of such river and the exertion of mere local influence no alternative be leave but to use the qualified veto with which the executive be invest by the constitution and to return the bill to the house in which originate for ultimate reconsideration and decision in sanction a bill of the same title with that return for the improvement of the mississippi and chief tributary and certain harbor on the lakes if bring apparently in conflict with any of the principle herein assert will arise on part exclusively from the want of a just appreciation of locality the mississippi occupy a footing altogether different from the river and water course of the different states no one state or any number of states can exercise any other jurisdiction over than for the punishment of crime and the service of civil process belong to no particular state or states but of common right by express reservation to all the states be reserve as a great common highway for the commerce of the whole country to have concede to louisiana or to any other state admit as a new state into the union the exclusive jurisdiction and consequently the right to make improvement and to levy toll on the segment of the river embrace within territorial limit would have be to have disappoint the chief object in the purchase of louisiana which be to secure the free use of the mississippi to all the people of the|united|state whether levy on commerce be make by a foreign or domestic government would have be equally burdensome and objectionable the|united|state therefore be charge with improvement for the benefit of all and the appropriation of governmental mean to improvement become indispensably necessary for the good of all as to the harbor on the lakes the act originate no new improvement but make appropriation for the continuance of work already begin be as much the duty of the government to construct good harbor without reference to the location or interest of city for the shelter of the extensive commerce of the lakes as to build breakwater on the atlantic coast for the protection of the trade of that ocean these great inland sea be visit by destructive storm and the annual loss of ship and cargo and consequently of revenue to the government be immense if then there be any work embrace by that act which be not require in order to afford shelter and security to the shipping against the tempest which so often sweep over those great inland sea but have on the contrary originate more in a spirit of speculation and local interest than in of the character allude to the|house|of|representatives will regard approval of the bill more as the result of misinformation than any design to abandon or modify the principle lay down in this message every system be liable to run into abuse and none more so than that under consideration and measure can not be too soon take by congress to guard against this evil transcript to in compliance with a resolution of the|house|of|representatives of the 23d of march last request the president to lay before the house the authority and the true copy of all request and application upon which deem duty to interfere with the naval and military force of the|united|state on the occasion of the recent attempt of the people of rhode|island to establish a free constitution in the place of the old charter government of that state also copy of the instruction to and statement of the charter commissioner send to by the then exist authority of the|state|of|rhode|island also copy of the correspondence between and the charter government of the|state|of|rhode|island and all the paper and document connect with the same also copy of the correspondence if any between the head of departments and say charter government or any person or person connect with the say government and of any accompany paper and document also copy of all order issue by the|executive|of the|united|state or any of the departments to military officer for the movement or employment of troop to or in rhode|island also copy of all order to naval officer to prepare steam or other vessel of the|united|state for service in the water of rhode|island also copy of all order to the officer of revenue cutter for the same service also copy of any instruction bear by the secretary of war to rhode|island on visit in to review the troop of the charter government also copy of any order or order to any officer or officer of the army or navy to report to the charter government and that be request to lay before this house copy of any other paper or document in the possession of the executive connect with this subject not above specifically enumerate have to inform the house that the executive do not deem duty to interfere with the naval and military force of the|united|state in the late disturbance in rhode|island that no order be issue by the executive or any of the departments to military officer for the movement or employment of troop to or in rhode|island other than those which accompany this message and which contemplate the strengthening of the garrison at fort|adam which consider the extent of the agitation in rhode|island be esteem necessary and judicious that no order be issue to naval officer to prepare steam or other vessel of the|united|state for service in the water of rhode|island that no order be issue to the officer of the revenue cutter for said service that no instruction be bear by the secretary of war to rhode|island on visit in to review the troop of the charter government that no order be give to any officer or officer of the army or navy to report to the charter government that request and application be make to the executive to fulfill the guaranty of the constitution which impose on the|federal|government the obligation to protect and defend each state of the union against domestic violence and foreign invasion but the executive be at no time convince that the casus faederis have arise which require the interposition of the military or naval power in the controversy which unhappily exist between the people of rhode|island be in no manner prevent from so interfere by the inquiry whether rhode|island exist as an independent state of the union under a charter grant at an early period by the crown of great britain or not be enough for the executive to know that be recognize as a sovereign state by great|britain by that at a later day have in common with sister states pour out blood and freely expend treasure in the|war|of|the|revolution that be a party to the|articles|of|confederation that at an after period adopt the|united|state as a free independent and republican state and that in this character have always possess full quota of representation in the senate and house|of|representatif and that up to a recent day have conduct all domestic affair and fulfil all obligation as a member of the union in peace and war under charter government as be denominate by the resolution of the|house|of|the|23d|march must be permit to disclaim entirely and unqualifiedly the right on the part of the executive to make any real or suppose defect exist in any state constitution or form of government the pretext for a failure to enforce the law or the guaranty of the|united|state in reference to any such state utterly repudiate the idea in term as emphatic as can employ that those law be not to be enforce or those guaranty comply with because the president may believe that the right of suffrage or any other great popular right be either too restrict or too broadly enlarge also with equal strength resist the idea that fail within the executive competency to decide in controversy of the nature of that which exist in rhode|island on which side be the majority of the people or as to the extent of the right of a mere numerical majority for the executive to assume such a power would be to assume a power of the most dangerous character under such assumption the|state of this union would have no security for peace or tranquillity but may be convert into the mere instrument of executive will actuate by selfish purpose may become the great agitator foment assault upon the state constitution and declare the majority of to day to be the minority of to morrow and the minority in turn the majority before whose decree the established order of thing in the state should be subvert revolution civil commotion and bloodshed would be the inevitable consequence the provision in the constitution intend for the security of the states would thus be turn into the instrument of destruction the president would become in fact the great constitution maker for the states and all power would be vest in hand when therefore the governor of rhode|island by letter of the 4th of april,|1842 make a requisition upon the executive for aid to put down the late disturbance have no hesitation in recognize the obligation of the executive to furnish such aid upon the occurrence of the contingency provide for by the constitution and law letter of the|11th|of|april in reply to the governor 's letter of the 4th be herewith communicate together with all correspondence which pass at a|subsequent|day and the letter and document mention in the schedule hereunto annex from the correspondence between and that of rhode|island will not escape observation that while regard as duty to announce the principle by which should govern in the contingency of an armed interposition on the part of this government be necessary to uphold the right of the state of rhode|island and to preserve domestic peace yet that the strong hope be indulge and express that all the difficulty would disappear before an enlightened policy of conciliation and compromise in that spirit address to governor king the letter of the|9th|of|may,|1842 mark private and confidential and receive reply of the|12th|of|may|of|the|same|year the desire of the executive be from the beginning to bring the dispute to a termination without the interposition of the military power of the|united|state and will continue to be a subject of self congratulation that this lead object of policy be finally accomplish the executive resist all entreaty however urgent to depart from this line of conduct information from private source have lead the executive to conclude that little else be design by mr. dorr and adherent than mere menace with a view to intimidation nor be this opinion in any degree shake until the|22d|of|june,|1842 when be strongly represent from reliable source as will be see by reference to the document herewith communicate that preparation be make by mr. dorr with a large force in arm to invade the state which force have be recruit in the neighboring states and have be already precede by the collection of military store in considerable quantity at or point this be a state of thing to which the executive could not be indifferent mr. dorr speedily afterwards take up headquarters at chepachet and assume the command of what be report to be a large force draw chiefly from voluntary enlistment make in neighbor states the executive could with difficulty bring to realize the fact that the citizen of other states should have forget duty to and the|united|state and have enter into the highly reprehensible and indefensible course of interfere so far in the concern of a sister state as to have enter into plan of invasion conquest and revolution but the executive feel to be duty to look minutely into the matter and therefore the secretary of war be dispatch to rhode|island with instruction a copy of which be herewith transmit and be authorize should a requisition be make upon the executive by the government of rhode|island in pursuance of law and the invader should not abandon purpose to call upon the governor of massachusetts and connecticut for a sufficient number of militia at once to arrest the invasion and to interpose such of the regular troop as could be spare from fort|adam for the defense of the city of providence in the event of being attack as be strongly represent to be in contemplation happily there be no necessity for either issue the proclamation or the requisition or for remove the troop from fort|adam where have be properly station chepachet be evacuate and mr. dorr 's troop disperse without the necessity of the interposition of any military force by this government thus confirm in early impression that nothing more have be design from the first by those associate with mr. dorr than to excite fear and apprehension and thereby to obtain concession from the constitute authority which may be claim as a triumph over the exist government with the dispersion of mr. dorr 's troop end all difficulty a convention be shortly afterwards call by due course of law to amend the fundamental law and a new constitution base on more liberal principle than that abrogate be propose and adopt by the people thus the great american experiment of a change in government under the influence of opinion and not of force have be again crown with success and the state and people of rhode|island repose in safety under institution of own adoption unterrifie by any future prospect of necessary change and secure against domestic violence and invasion from abroad congratulate the country upon so happy a termination of a condition of thing which seem at time seriously to threaten the public peace may justly be regard as worthy of the age and of the country in which live transcript to the senate and house|of|representatif of the|united|state if any people ever have cause to render up thank to the supreme being for parental care and protection extend to in all the trial and difficulty to which have be from time to time expose certainly be that people from the first settlement of forefather on this continent through the danger attendant upon the occupation of a savage wilderness through a long period of colonial dependence through the|war|of|the|revolution in the wisdom which lead to the adoption of the exist form of republican government in the hazard incident to a war subsequently wag with of the most powerful nation of the earth in the increase of population in the spread of the art and science and in the strength and durability confer on political institution emanate from the people and sustain by will the superintendence of an overrule providence have be plainly visible as preparatory therefore to enter once more upon the high duty of legislation become humbly to acknowledge dependence upon as guide and protector and to implore a continuance of parental watchfulness over beloved country have new cause for the expression of gratitude in the preservation of the health of fellow citizen with some partial and local exception during the|past|season for the abundance with which the earth have yield up fruit to the labor of the husbandman for the renew activity which have be impart to commerce for the revival of trade in all department for the increase reward attendant on the exercise of the mechanic art for the continue growth of population and the rapidly revive prosperity of the whole country shall be permit to exchange congratulation with gentleman of the houses|of|congress on these auspicious circumstance and to assure in advance of ready disposition to cur with in the adoption of all such measure as shall be calculate to increase the happiness of constituent and to advance the glory of common country since the last adjournment of congress the executive have relax no effort to render indestructible the relation of amity which so happily exist between the|united|state and other country the treaty lately conclude with great|britain have tend greatly to increase the good understanding which a reciprocity of interest be calculate to encourage and be most ardently to be hope that nothing may transpire to interrupt the relation of amity which be so obviously the policy of both nation to cultivate a question of much importance still remain to be adjust between the territorial limit of the country relation to what be commonly know as the|oregon|territory still remain in dispute the|united|state would be at all time indisposed to aggrandize at the expense of any other nation but while would be restrain by principle of honor which should govern the conduct of nation as well as that of individual from set up a demand for territory which do not belong to would as unwillingly send to a surrender of right after the most rigid and as far as practicable unbiased examination of the subject the|united|state have always contend that right appertain to the entire region of country lie on the pacific and embrace within and ° ' of north latitude this claim be controvert by great|britain those who have precede the present executive actuate no doubt by an earnest desire to adjust the matter upon term mutually satisfactory to both country have cause to be submit to the|british|government proposition for settlement and final adjustment which however have not prove heretofore acceptable to minister at london have under instruction again bring the subject to the consideration of that government and while nothing will be do to compromise the right or honor of the|united|state every proper expedient will be resort to in order to bring the negotiation now in the progress of resumption to a speedy and happy termination in the meantime be proper to remark that many of citizen be either already establish in the territory or be on way thither for the purpose of form permanent settlement while other be prepare to follow and in view of these fact must repeat the recommendation contain in previous message for the establishment of military post at such place on the line of travel as will furnish security and protection to hardy adventurer against hostile tribe of indians inhabit those extensive region law should also follow so modify as the circumstance of the case may seem to require under the influence of free system of government new republic be destine to spring up at no distant day on the shore of the pacific similar in policy and in feeling to those exist on this side of the|rocky|mountain and give a wide and more extensive spread to the principle of civil and religious liberty be happy to inform that the case which have from time to time arise of the detention of american vessel by british cruiser on the coast of africa under pretense of be engage in the slave trade have be place in a fair train of adjustment in the case of the william and francis full satisfaction will be allow in the case of the tygris and seamew the british government admit that satisfaction be due in the case of the jones the sum accrue from the sale of that vessel and cargo will be pay to the owner while can not but flatter that full indemnification will be allow for all damage sustain by the detention of the vessel and in the case of the douglas majesty 's government have express determination to make indemnification strong hope be therefore entertain that most if not all of these case will be speedily adjust no new case have arise since the ratification of the treaty of washington and be confidently anticipate that the slave trade under the operation of the eighth article of that treaty will be altogether suppress the occasional interruption experience by fellow citizen engage in the fishery on the neighboring coast of nova|scotia have not fail to claim the attention of the executive representation upon this subject have be make but as yet no definitive answer to those representation have be receive from other subject of comparatively minor importance but nevertheless of too much consequence to be neglect remain still to be adjust between the country by the treaty between the|united|state and great|britain of july,|1815 be provide that no high duty shall be levy in either country on article import from the other than on the same article import from any other place in rough rice by act of parliament be admit from the coast of africa into great|britain on the payment of a duty of a quarter while the same article from all other country include the|united|state be subject to the payment of a duty of a quarter minister at london have from time to time bring this subject to the attention of the|british|government but so far without success be instruct to renew representation upon some|year since a claim be prefer against the|british|government on the part of certain american merchant for the return of export duty pay by on shipment of woolen good to the|united|state after the duty on similar article export to other country have be repeal and consequently in contravention of the commercial convention between the nation secure to equality in such case the principle on which the claim rest have long since be virtually admit by great|britain but obstacle to a settlement have from time to time be interpose so that a large portion of the amount claim have not yet be refund minister be now engage in the prosecution of the claim and can not but persuade that the|british|government will no longer delay adjustment be happy to be able to say that nothing have occur to disturb in any degree the relation of amity which exist between the|united|state and france austria and russia as well as with the other power of europe since the adjournment of congress spain have be agitate with internal convulsion for many|years from the effect of which be hope be destine speedily to recover when under a more liberal system of commercial policy on part trade with may again fill old and so far as continental possession be concern almost forsaken channel thereby add to the mutual prosperity of the country the|germanic|association|of|customs|and|commerce which since establishment in have be steadily grow in power and importance and consist at this time of more than german states and embrace a population of people unite for all fire purpose of commercial intercourse with each other and with foreign state offer to the latter the most valuable exchange on principle more liberal than be offer in the fiscal system of any other european power from origin the importance of the german union have never be lose sight of by the|united|state the industry morality and other valuable quality of the german nation have always be well know and appreciate on this subject invite the attention of congress to the report of the secretary of state from which will be see that while cotton be admit free of duty and the duty on rice have be much reduce which have already lead to a greatly increase consumption a strong disposition have be recently evince by that great body to reduce upon certain condition present duty upon tobacco this be the first intimation of a concession on this interesting subject ever make by any european power can not but regard as well calculate to remove the only impediment which have so far exist to the most liberal commercial intercourse between and in this view minister at berlin who have heretofore industriously pursue the subject have be instruct to enter upon the negotiation of a commercial treaty which while will open new advantage to the agricultural interest of the|united|state and a more free and expanded field for commercial operation will affect injuriously no exist interest of the union should the negotiation be crown with success result will be communicate to both houses of congress communicate herewith certain dispatch receive from minister at mexico and also a correspondence which have recently occur between the envoy from that republic and the secretary of state must but be regard as not a little extraordinary that the|government|of|mexico in anticipation of a public discussion which have be pleased to infer from newspaper publication as likely to take place in congress relate to the annexation of texas to should have so far anticipate the result of such discussion as to have announce determination to visit any such anticipate decision by a formal declaration of war against the|united|state if design to prevent congress from introduce that question as a fit subject for calm deliberation and final judgment the executive have no reason to doubt that will entirely fail of object the representative of a brave and patriotic people will suffer no apprehension of future consequence to embarrass in the course of propose deliberation nor will the executive department of the government fail for any such cause to discharge whole duty to the country the war which have exist for so long a time between mexico and texas have since the battle of san|jacinto consist for the most part of predatory incursion which while have be attend with much of suffering to individual and have keep the border of the country in a state of constant alarm have fail to approach to any definitive result mexico have fit out no formidable armament by land or by sea for the subjugation of texas have now elapse since texas declare independence of mexico and during that time have be recognize as a sovereign power by several of the principal civilized state mexico nevertheless persevere in plan of reconquest and refuse to recognize independence the predatory incursion to which have allude have be attend in instance with the breaking up of the court of justice by the seizing upon the person of the judge jury and officer of the court and drag along with unarmed and therefore noncombatant citizen into a cruel and oppressive bondage thus leave crime to go unpunished and immorality to pass unreproved a border warfare be evermore to be deprecate and over such a war as have exist for so|many|year between these states humanity have have great cause to lament nor be such a condition of thing to be deplore only because of the individual suffering attendant upon the effect be far more extensive the|creator|of|the|universe have give man the earth for rest place and fruit for subsistence whatever therefore shall make the first or any part of a scene of desolation affect injuriously heritage and may be regard as a general calamity war may sometimes be necessary but all nation have a common interest in bring speedily to a close the|united|state have an immediate interest in see an end put to the state of hostility exist between mexico and texas be neighbor of the same continent with whom be not only desirous of cultivate the relation of amity but of the most extended commercial intercourse and to practice all the rite of a neighborhood hospitality own interest be involve in the matter since however neutral may be course of policy can not hope to escape the effect of a spirit of jealousy on the part of both of the power nor can this government be indifferent to the fact that a warfare such as be wag between those nation be calculate to weaken both power and finally to render and especially the weak of the the subject of interference on the part of strong and more powerful nation who intent only on advance own peculiar view may sooner or later attempt to bring about a compliance with term as the condition of interposition alike derogatory to the nation grant and detrimental to the interest of the|united|state could not be expect quietly to permit any such interference to disadvantage consider that texas be separate from the|united|state by a mere geographical line that territory in the opinion of many down to a late period form a portion of the territory of the|united|state that be homogeneous in population and pursuit with adjoin states make contribution to the commerce of the world in the same article with and that most of inhabitant have be citizen of the|united|state speak the same language and live under similar political institution with this government be bind by every consideration of interest as well as of sympathy to see that shall be leave free to act especially in regard to domestic affair unawe by force and unrestraine by the policy or view of other country in full view of all these consideration the executive have not hesitate to express to the|government|of|mexico how deeply deprecate a continuance of the war and how anxiously desire to witness termination can not but think that become the|united|state as the old of the|american|republics to hold a language to mexico upon this subject of an unambiguous character be time that this war have cease there must be a limit to all war and if the parent state after an|eight|years struggle have fail to reduce to submission a portion of subject stand out in revolt against and who have not only proclaim to be independent but have be recognize as such by other power ought not to expect that other nation will quietly look on to obvious injury upon a protraction of hostility these|united|state throw off colonial dependence and establish independent government and great|britain after have waste energy in the attempt to subdue for a less period than mexico have attempt to subjugate texas have the wisdom and justice to acknowledge independence thereby recognize the obligation which rest on as of the family of nation an example thus set by of the proud as well as most powerful nation of the earth could in no way disparage mexico to imitate while therefore the executive would deplore any collision with mexico or any disturbance of the friendly relation which exist between the country can not permit that government to control policy whatever may be toward texas but will treat as by the recognition of independence the|united|state have long since declare would do as entirely independent of mexico the high obligation of public duty may enforce from the constitute authority of the|united|state a policy which the course persevere in by mexico will have mainly contribute to produce and the executive in such a touting will with confidence throw upon the patriotism of the people to sustain the government in course of action measure of an unusual character have recently be adopt by the|mexican|government calculate in no small degree to affect the trade of other nation with mexico and to operate injuriously to the|united|state all foreigner by a decree of the|23d|day|of|september and after six|month from of promulgation be forbid to carry on the business of sell by retail any good within the confine of mexico against this decree minister have not fail to remonstrate the trade heretofore carry on by citizen with santa|fe in which much capital be already invest and which be become of daily increase importance have suddenly be arrest by a decree of virtual prohibition on the part of the|mexican|government whatever may be the right of mexico to prohibit any particular course of trade to the citizen or subject of foreign power this late procedure to say the least of wear a harsh and unfriendly aspect the installment on the claim recently settle by the convention with mexico have be punctually pay as have fall due and minister be engage in urge the establishment of a new commission in pursuance of the convention for the settlement of unadjusted claim with the other american states relation of amity and good will have remain uninterrupted minister near the|republic|of|new|granada have succeed in effect an adjustment of the claim upon that government for the schoon by chance which have be pende for many|years the claim for the brig morris which have origin during the existence of the|republic|of|colombia and indemnification for which since the dissolution of that republic have devolve upon several member will be urge with renew zeal have much pleasure in say that the|government|of|brazil have adjust the claim upon that government in the case of the schoon john|s.|bryan and that sanguine hope be entertain that the same spirit of justice will influence council in arrive at an early decision upon the remain claim thereby remove all cause of dissension between power whose interest be to some extent interweave with each other minister at chili have succeed in induce a recognition by that government of the adjustment effect by predecessor of the first claim in the case of the macedonian the first installment have be receive by the claimant in the|united|state notice of the exchange of ratification of the treaty with peru which will take place at lima have not yet reach this country but be shortly expect to be receive when the claim upon that republic will doubtless be liquidate and pay in consequence of a misunderstanding between this government and that of buenos|ayres occur this government have remain unrepresented at that court while a minister from have be constantly resident here the cause of irritation have in a great measure pass away and be in contemplation in view of important interest which have grow up in that country at some early period during the present session of congress with the concurrence of the senate to restore diplomatic relation between the country under the provision of an act of congress of the last session a minister be dispatch from the|united|state to china in august|of|the|present|year who from the late account have from be at suez in egypt on the|25th|of|september last on route to china in regard to the indian tribe reside within jurisdictional limit the great vigilance of the government have be exert to preserve at peace among and to inspire with feeling of confidence in the justice of this government and to cultivate friendship with the border inhabitant this have happily succeed to a great extent but be a subject of regret that suffer in some instance to be impose upon by artful and design man and this notwithstanding all effort of the government to prevent the receipt into the treasury for exclusive of loan be and the expenditure exclusive of the payment on the public debt will have be about|$23,000,000 by the|act|of|1842 a new arrangement of the|fiscal|year be make so that should commence on the account and estimate for the|current|fiscal|year will show that the loan and treasury note make and issue before the close of the last congress to meet the anticipate deficiency have not be entirely adequate although on the|1st|of|october last there be a balance in the treasury in consequence of the provision thus make of yet the appropriation already make by congress will absorb that balance and leave a probable deficiency of at the close of there be outstanding treasury note to about the amount of and should be return upon the treasury during the|fiscal|year will require provision for redemption do not however regard this as probable since have obviously enter into the currency of the country and will continue to form a portion of if the system now adopt be continue the loan of amount to fall due on the|1st|day|of|january,|1845 and must be provide for or postpone by a new loan and unless the resource of revenue should be materially increase by there will be a probable deficiency for the service of the|fiscal|year|ending|june|30,|1845 of upward of the delusion incident to an enormously excessive paper circulation which give a fictitious value to everything and stimulate adventure and speculation to an extravagant extent have be happily succeed by the substitution of the precious metal and paper promptly redeemable in specie and thus false value have disappear and a sounder condition of thing have be introduce this transition although intimately connect with the prosperity of the country have nevertheless be attend with much embarrassment to the government in financial concern so long as the foreign importer could receive payment for cargo in a currency of greatly less value than that in europe but fully available here in the purchase of agricultural production profit be immeasurably augment by the operation the shipment be large and the revenue of the government become superabundant but the change in the character of the circulation from a nominal and apparently real value in the first stage of existence to an obviously depreciated value in second so that no longer answer the purpose of exchange or barter and ultimate substitution by a sound metallic and paper circulation combine have be attend by diminished importation and a consequent fall off in the revenue this have induce congress from to resort to the expedient of issue treasury note and finally of fund in order to supply deficiency can not however withhold the remark that be in no way compatible with the dignity of the government that a public debt should be create in time of peace to meet the current expense of the government or that temporary expedient should be resort to an hour longer than be possible to avoid the executive can do no more than apply the mean which congress place in hand for the support of government and happily for the good of the country and for the preservation of liberty possess no power to levy exaction on the people or to force from contribution to the public revenue in any form can only recommend such measure as may in opinion be call for by the want of the public service to congress with whom alone rest the power to lay and collect taxis duty impost and excise this duty have upon several occasion heretofore be perform the present condition of thing give flatter promise that trade and commerce be rapidly revive and fortunately for the country the source of revenue have only to be open in order to prove abundant while can anticipate no considerable increase in the proceed of the sale of the public land for reason perfectly obvious to all for several|year to come yet the public land can not otherwise than be regard as the foundation of the public credit with so large a body of the most fertile land in the world under the control and at the disposal of this government no one can reasonably doubt the entire ability to meet engagement under every emergency in season of trial and difficulty similar to those through which be pass the capitalist make investment in the government cut stock with the most assure confidence of ultimate reimbursement and whatever may be say of a period of great financial prosperity such as exist for some|years|after|1833 should regard as suicidal in a season of financial embarrassment either to alienate the land or the proceed arise from sale the first and paramount duty of those to whom may be intrust the administration of public affair be to guard the public credit in reestablish the credit of this central government the ready and most obvious mode be take to restore the credit of the states the extremity can only be make sound by produce a healthy action in the central government and the history of the|present|day fully establish the fact that an increase in the value of the stock of this government will in a great majority of instance be attend by an increase in the value of the stock of the states should therefore be a matter of general congratulation that amidst all the embarrassment arise from surround circumstance the credit of the government should have be so fully restore that have be enable to effect a loan of to redeem that amount of treasury note on term more favorable than any that have be offer for many|years and the stock which be create in have advance in the hand of the holder nearly per cent above par value the confidence of the people in the integrity of government have thus be signally manifest these opinion relative to the public land do not in any manner conflict with the observance of the most liberal policy toward those of fellow citizen who press forward into the wilderness and be the pioneer in the work of reclamation in secure to all such right of preemption the government perform but an act of retributive justice for suffering encounter and hardship endure and find ample remuneration in the comfort which policy insure and the happiness which impart should a revision of the tariff with a view to revenue become necessary in the estimation of congress doubt not will approach the subject with a just and enlightened regard to the interest of the whole union the principle and view which have heretofore have occasion to submit remain unchanged can however never be too often repeat that the prominent interest of every important pursuit of life require for success permanency and stability in legislation these can only be attain by adopt as the basis of action moderation in all thing which be as indispensably necessary to secure the harmonious action of the political as of the animal system in political organization no section of the country should desire to have suppose interest advance at the sacrifice of all other but union be the great interest equally precious to all should be foster and sustain by mutual concession and the cultivation of that spirit of compromise from which the constitution proceed will be inform by the report from the|treasury|department of the measure take under the act of the last session authorize the reissue of treasury note in lieu of those then outstanding the system adopt in pursuance of exist law seem well calculated to save the country a large amount of interest while afford convenience and obviate danger and expense in the transmission of fund to disburse agent refer also to that report for the mean propose by the secretary to increase the revenue and particularly to that portion of which relate to the subject of the warehouse system which earnestly urge upon congress at last session and as to the importance of which opinion have undergo no change in view of the disordered condition of the currency at the time and the high rate of exchange between different part of the country feel to be incumbent on to present to the consideration of predecessor a proposition conflict in no degree with the constitution or with the right of the states and have the sanction not in detail but in principle of some of the eminent man who have precede in the executive office that proposition contemplate the issuing of treasury note of denomination of not less|than|$5 nor more|than|$100 to be employ in the payment of the obligation of the government in lieu of gold and silver at the option of the public creditor and to an amount not exceed be propose to make receivable everywhere and to establish at various point depository of gold and silver to be hold in trust for the redemption of such note so as to insure convertibility into specie no doubt be entertain that such note would have maintain a par value with gold and silver thus furnish a paper currency of equal value over the union thereby meet the just expectation of the people and fulfil the duty of a parental government whether the depository should be permit to sell or purchase bill under very limited restriction together with all other detail be submit to the wisdom of congress and be regard as of secondary importance think then and think now that such an arrangement would have be attend with the happy result the whole matter of the currency would have be place where by the constitution be design to be place under the immediate supervision and control of congress the action of the government would have be independent of all corporation and the same eye which rest unceasingly on the specie currency and guard against adulteration would also have rest on the paper currency to control and regulate issue and protect against depreciation the same reason which would forbid congress from part with the power over the coinage would seem to operate with nearly equal force hi regard to any substitution for the precious metal in the form of a circulate medium paper when substitute for specie constitute a standard of value by which the operation of society be regulate and whatsoever cause depreciation affect society to an extent nearly if not quite equal to the adulteration of the coin nor can withhold the remark that advantage contrast with a bank of the|united|state apart from the fact that a bank be esteem as obnoxious to the public sentiment as well on the score of expediency as of constitutionality appear to to be striking and obvious the relief which a bank would afford by an issue of of note judge from the experience of the late united|states|bank would not have occur in less|than|fifteen|year whereas under the propose arrangement the relief arise from the issue of of treasury note would have be consummate in one|year thus furnish in fifteenth part of the time in which a bank could have accomplish a paper medium of exchange equal in amount to the real want of the country at par value with gold and silver the saving to the government would have be equal to all the interest which have have to pay on treasury note of previous as well as subsequent issue thereby relieve the government and at the same time afford relief to the people under all the responsibility attach to the station which occupy and in redemption of a pledge give to the last congress at the close of first session submit the suggestion to consideration at consecutive session the recommendation however meet with no favor at hand while be free to admit that the necessity of the time have since become greatly ameliorate and that there be good reason to hope that the country be safely and rapidly emerge from the difficulty and embarrassment which everywhere surround in yet can not but think that restoration to a sound and healthy condition would be greatly expedite by a resort to the expedient in a modify form the operation of the treasury now rest upon the act of and the resolution of and those law have be so administer as to produce as great a quantum of good to the country as provision be capable of yielding if there have be any distinct expression of opinion go to show that public sentiment be averse to the plan either as heretofore recommend to congress or in a modify form while own opinion in regard to would remain unchanged should be very far from again present to consideration the government have originate with the states and the people for own benefit and advantage and would be subversive of the foundation principle of the political edifice which have rear to persevere in a measure which in mature judgment have either repudiate or condemn the will of constituent clearly express should be regard as the light to guide footstep the true difference between a monarchical or aristocratical government and a republic be that in the first the will of the few prevail over the will of the many while in the last the will of the many should be alone consult the report of the secretary of war will bring acquaint with the condition of that important branch of the public service the army may be regard in consequence of the small number of the rank and file in each company and regiment as little more than a nucleus around which to rally the military force of the country in case of war and yet service in preserve the peace of the frontier be of a most important nature in all case of emergency the reliance of the country be properly place in the militia of the several states and may well deserve the consideration of congress whether a new and more perfect organization may not be introduce look mainly to the volunteer company of the union for the present and of easy application to the great body of the militia in time of war the expenditure of the|war|department have be considerably reduce in the|last|two|year contingency however may arise which would call for the filling up of the regiment with a full complement of man and make very desirable to remount the corps of dragoon which by an act of the last congress be direct to be dissolve refer to the accompanying report of the secretary for information in relation to the navy of the|united|state while every effort have be and will continue to be make to retrench all superfluity and lop off all excrescence which from time to time may have grow up yet have not be regard as wise or prudent to recommend any material change in the annual appropriation the interest which be involve be of too important a character to lead to the recommendation of any other than a liberal policy adequate appropriation ought to be make to enable the executive to fit out all the ship that be now in a course of building or that require repair for active service in the short possible time should any emergency arise which may require an efficient navy while be the cheap mean of public defense enlist in support the feeling of pride and confidence which brilliant deed and heroic valor have heretofore serve to strengthen and confirm refer particularly to that part of the secretary 's report which have reference to recent experiment in the application of steam and in the construction of war steamer make under the superintendence of distinguished officer of the navy in addition to other manifest improvement in the construction of the steam engine and application of the motive power which have render more appropriate to the us of ship of war of those officer have bring into use a power which make the steamship most formidable either for attack or defense can not too strongly recommend this subject to consideration and do not hesitate to express entire conviction of great importance call particular attention also to that portion of the secretary 's report which have reference to the act of the late session of congress which prohibit the transfer of any balance of appropriation from other head of appropriation to that for building equipment and repair the repeal of that prohibition will enable the department to give renew employment to a large class of workman who have be necessarily discharge in consequence of the want of mean to pay a circumstance attend especially at this|season|of|the|year with much privation and suffering give great pain to announce to the loss of the steamship the missouri by fire in the|bay|of|gibraltar where have stop to renew supply of coal on voyage to alexandria with mr. cushing the american minister to china on board there be ground for high commendation of the officer and man for the coolness and intrepidity and perfect submission to discipline evince under the most trying circumstance surround by a rage fire which the utmost exertion could not subdue and which threaten momentarily the explosion of well supply magazine the officer exhibit no sign of fear and the man obey every order with alacrity nor be abandon until the last gleam of hope of save have expire be well worthy of consideration whether the loss sustain by the officer and crew in this unfortunate affair should not be reimburse to can not take leave of this painful subject without advert to the aid render upon the occasion by the british authority at gibraltar and the commander officer and crew of the british ship of the line the malabar which be lie at the time in the bay everything that generosity or humanity could dictate be promptly perform be by such act of good will by to another of the family of nation that fraternal feeling be nourish and the blessing of permanent peace secure the report of the|postmaster general will bring acquaint with the operation of that department during the|past|year and will suggest to such modification of the exist law as in opinion the exigency of the public service may require the change which the country have undergo of late|year in the mode of travel and transportation have afford so many facility for the transmission of mail matter out of the regular mail as to require the great vigilance and circumspection in order to enable the officer at the head of the department to restrain the expenditure within the income there be also too much reason to fear that the franking privilege have run into great abuse the department nevertheless have be conduct with the great vigor and have attain at the least possible expense all the useful object for which be establish in regard to all the departments be quite happy in the belief that nothing have be leave undo which be call for by a true spirit of economy or by a system of accountability rigidly enforce this be in some degree apparent from the fact that the government have sustain no loss by the default of any of agent in the complex but at the same time beautiful machinery of system of government be not a matter of surprise that some remote agency may have fail for an instant to fulfill desired office but feel confident in the assertion that nothing have occur to interrupt the harmonious action of the government and that while the law have be execute with efficiency and vigor the right neither of states nor individual have be trample on or disregard in the meantime the country have be steadily advance in all that contribute to national greatness the tide of population continue unbrokenly to flow into the new states and territories where a refuge be find not only for native bear fellow citizen but for emigrant from all part of the civilized world who come among to partake of the blessing of free institution and to aid by labor to swell the current of wealth and power be due to every consideration of public policy that the lake and river of the west should receive all such attention at the hand of congress as the constitution will enable to bestow work in favorable and proper situation on the lakes would be find to be as indispensably necessary in case of war to carry on safe and successful naval operation as fortification on the atlantic seaboard the appropriation make by the last congress for the improvement of the navigation of the|mississippi|river have be diligently and efficiently apply can not close this communication gentleman without recommend to most favorable consideration the interest of this district appoint by the constitution exclusive legislator and form in this particular the only anomaly in system of government of the legislative body be elect by other than those for whose advantage be to legislate will feel a superadded obligation to look well into condition and to leave no cause for complaint or regret the seat of government of associate republic can not but be regard as worthy of parental care in connection with other interest as well as those of the whole country recommend that at present session adopt such measure in order to carry into effect the smithsonian bequest as in judgment will be best calculate to consummate the liberal intent of the testator when under a dispensation of divine|providence succeed to the presidential office the state of public affair be embarrassing and critical to add to the irritation consequent upon a long stand controversy with of the most powerful nation of modern time involve not only question of boundary which under the most favorable circumstance be always embarrassing but at the same time important and high principle of maritime law border controversy between the citizen and subject of the country have engender a state of feeling and of conduct which threaten the most calamitous consequence the hazard incident to this state of thing be greatly heighten by the arrest and imprisonment of a subject of great|britain who act as be allege as a part of a military force have aid in the commission of an act violative of the territorial jurisdiction of the|united|state and involve the murder of a citizen of the|state|of|new|york a large amount of claim against the|government|of|mexico remain unadjusted and a war of several year ' continuance with the savage tribe of florida still prevail attend with the desolation of a large portion of that beautiful territory and with the sacrifice of many valuable life to increase the embarrassment of the government individual and state credit have be nearly stricken down and confidence in the|general|government be so much impair that loan of a small amount could only be negotiate at a considerable sacrifice as a necessary consequence of the blight which have fall on commerce and mechanical industry the ship of the be throw out of employment and the operation of the other have be greatly diminish owe to the condition of the currency exchange between different part of the country have become ruinously high and trade have to depend on a depreciated paper currency in conduct transaction shall be permit to congratulate the country that under an overrule providence peace be preserve without a sacrifice of the national honor the war in florida be bring to a speedy termination a large portion of the claim on mexico have be fully adjudicate and be in a course of payment while justice have be render to in other matter by other nation confidence between man and man be in a great measure restore and the credit of this government fully and perfectly reestablish commerce be become more and more extended in operation and manufacturing and mechanical industry once more reap the reward of skill and labor honestly apply the operation of trade rest on a sound currency and the rate of exchange be reduce to low amount in this condition of thing have feel to be duty to bring to favorable consideration matter of great interest in present and ultimate result and the only desire which feel in connection with the future be and will continue to be to leave the country prosperous and institution unimpaire transcript to the senate and house|of|representatif of the|united|state communicate herewith to congress copy of a correspondence which have recently take place between certain agent of the|government|of|the|hawaiian or and the secretary of state the condition of those island have excite a good deal of interest which be increase by every successive proof that inhabitant be make progress in civilization and become more and more competent to maintain regular and orderly civil government lie in the|pacific|ocean much nearer to this continent than the other and have become an important place for the refitment and provisioning of american and european vessel owe to locality and to the course of the wind which prevail in this|quarter of the world the|sandwich|island be the stop place for almost all vessel pass from continent to continent across the|pacific|ocean be especially resort to by the great number of vessel of the|united|state which be engage in the whale fishery in those sea the number of vessel of all sort and the amount of property own by citizen of the|united|state which be find in those island in the course of the|year be state probably with sufficient accuracy in the letter of the agent just emerge from a state of barbarism the government of the island be as yet feeble but disposition appear to be just and pacific and seem anxious to improve the condition of people by the introduction of knowledge of religious and moral institution mean of education and the art of civilized life can not but be in conformity with the interest and wish of the government and the people of the|united|state that this community thus exist in the midst of a vast expanse of ocean should be respect and all right strictly and conscientiously regard and this must also be the true interest of all other commercial state far remote from the dominion of european power growth and prosperity as an independent state may yet be in a high degree useful to all whose trade be extend to those region while near approach to this continent and the intercourse which american vessel have with such vessel constitute sixth of all which annually visit could not but create dissatisfaction on the part of the|united|state at any attempt by another power should such attempt be threaten or fear to take possession of the island colonize and subvert the native government considering therefore that the|united|stat possess so large a share of the intercourse with those island be deem not unfit to make the declaration that government seek nevertheless no peculiar advantage no exclusive control over the|hawaiian|government but be content with independent existence and anxiously wish for security and prosperity forbearance in this respect under the circumstance of the very large intercourse of citizen with the island would justify this government should event hereafter arise to require in make a decide remonstrance against the adoption of an opposite policy by any other power under the circumstance recommend to congress to provide for a moderate allowance to be make out of the treasury to the consul reside there that in a government so new and a country so remote american citizen may have respectable authority to which to apply for redress in case of injury to person and property and to whom the government of the country may also make know any act commit by american citizen of which may think have a right to complain event of considerable importance have recently transpire in china the military operation carry on against that empire by the|english|government have be terminate by a treaty accord to the term of which important port hitherto shut against foreign commerce be to be open to british merchant viz amoy,|foo choo foo,|ningpo and chinghai can not but be interesting to the mercantile interest of the|united|state whose intercourse with china at the single port of canton have already become so considerable to ascertain whether these other port now open to british commerce be to remain shut nevertheless against the commerce of the|united|state the treaty between and the british commissioner provide neither for the admission nor the exclusion of the ship of other nation would seem therefore that remain with every other nation have commercial intercourse with china to seek to make proper arrangement for with the government of that empire in this respect the importation into the|united|state from china be know to be large have amount in some|years as will be see by the annex table to the export too from the|united|state to china constitute an interesting and grow part of the commerce of the country appear that in the|year|1841 in the direct trade between the country the value of the export from the|united|state amount to in domestic produce and in foreign merchandise but the whole amount of american produce which finally reach china and be there consume be not comprise in these table which show only the direct trade many vessel with american product on board sail with a primary destination to other country but ultimately dispose of more or less of cargo in the port of canton the peculiarity of and the chinese character be well know an empire suppose to contain subject fertile in various rich product of the earth not without the knowledge of letter and of many art and with large and expensive accommodation for internal intercourse and traffic have for age seek to exclude the visit of stranger and foreigner from dominion and have assume for a superiority over all other nation event appear likely to break down and soften this spirit of nonintercourse and to bring china ere long into the relation which usually subsist between civilized state have agree in the treaty with england that correspondence between the agent of the government shall be on equal term a concession which be hardly probable will hereafter be withhold from other nation be true that the cheapness of labor among the chinese ingenuity in application and the fix character of habit and pursuit may discourage the hope of the opening of any great and sudden demand for the fabric of other country but experience prove that the production of western nation find a market to some extent among the chinese that that market so far as respect the production of the|united|state although have considerably vary in successive season have on the whole more than double within the|last|ten|year and can hardly be doubt that the opening of several new and important port connect with part of the empire heretofore seldom visit by europeans or americans would exercise a favorable influence upon the demand for such production be not understand that the immediate establishment of correspondent embassy and mission or the permanent residence of diplomatic functionary with full power of each country at the|court|of|the|other be contemplate between england and china although as have be already observe have be stipulate that intercourse between the country shall hereafter be on equal term an ambassador or envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary can only be accredit accord to the usage of western nation to the head or sovereign of the state and may be doubtful whether the|court|of|pekin be yet prepared to conform to these usage so far as to receive a minister plenipotentiary to reside near be of opinion however that the commercial interest of the|united|state connect with china require at the present moment a degree of attention and vigilance such as there be no agent of this government on the spot to bestow recommend to congress to make appropriation for the compensation of a commissioner to reside in china to exercise a watchful care over the concern of american citizen and for the protection of person and property empower to hold intercourse with the local authority and ready under instruction from government should such instruction become necessary and proper hereafter to address to the high functionary of the empire or through to the emperor will not escape the observation of congress that in order to secure the important object of any such measure a citizen of much intelligence and weight of character should be employ on such agency and that to secure the service of such an individual a compensation should be make correspond with the magnitude and importance of the mission transcript to the senate and house|of|representatif of the|united|state have continue reason to express profound gratitude to the|great|creator|of|all|thing for numberless benefit confer upon as a people bless with genial season the husbandman have garner fill with abundance and the necessary of life not to speak of luxury abound in every direction while in some other nation steady and industrious labor can hardly find the mean of subsistence the great evil which have to encounter be a surplus of production beyond the home demand which seek and with difficulty find a partial market in other region the health of the country with partial exception have for the|past|year be well preserve and under free and wise institution the|united|state be rapidly advance toward the consummation of the high destiny which an overrule providence seem to have mark out for exempt from domestic convulsion and at peace with all the world be leave free to consult as to the good mean of secure and advance the happiness of the people such be the circumstance under which now assemble in respective chamber and which should lead to unite in praise and thanksgiving to that great being who make and who preserve as a nation congratulate fellow citizen on the happy change in the aspect of foreign affair since last annual message cause of complaint at that time exist between the|united|state and great|britain which attend by irritate circumstance threaten most seriously the public peace the difficulty of adjust amicably the question at issue between the country be in no small degree augment by the lapse of time since have origin the opinion entertain by the executive on several of the lead topic in dispute be frankly set forth in the message at the opening of late session the appointment of a special minister by great|britain to the|united|state with power to negotiate upon most of the point of difference indicate a desire on part amicably to adjust and that minister be meet by the executive in the same spirit which have dictate mission the treaty consequent thereon have be duly ratify by the government a copy together with the correspondence which accompany be herewith communicate trust that whilst may see in nothing objectionable may be the mean of preserve for an indefinite period the amicable relation happily exist between the government the question of peace or war between the|united|state and great|britain be a question of the deep interest not only to but to the civilized world since be scarcely possible that a war could exist between without endanger the peace of christendom the immediate effect of the treaty upon will be feel in the security afford to mercantile enterprise which no longer apprehensive of interruption adventure speculation in the most distant sea and freight with the diversify production of every land return to bless own there be nothing in the treaty which in the slight degree compromit the honor or dignity of either nation next to the settlement of the boundary line which must always be a matter of difficulty between state as between individual the question which seem to threaten the great embarrassment be that connect with the african slave trade by the tenth article of the treaty of ghent be expressly declare whereas the traffic in slave be irreconcilable with the principle of humanity and justice and whereas both majesty and the|united|state be desirous of continue effort to promote entire abolition be hereby agree that both the contracting party shall use good endeavor to accomplish so desirable an object in the enforcement of the law and treaty stipulation of great|britain a practice have threaten to grow up on the part of cruiser of subjecting to visitation ship sail under the american flag which while seriously involve maritime right would subject to vexation a branch of trade which be daily increase and which require the fostering care of government and although lord|aberdeen in correspondence with the american envoy at london expressly disclaim all right to detain an american ship on the high sea even if find with a cargo of slave on board and restrict the british pretension to a mere claim to visit and inquire yet could not well be discern by the|executive|of the|united|state how such visit and inquiry could be make without detention on the voyage and consequent interruption to the trade be regard as the right of search present only in a new form and express in different word and therefore feel to be duty distinctly to declare in annual message to congress that no such concession could be make and that the|united|states have both the will and the ability to enforce own law and to protect flag from be use for purpose wholly forbid by those law and obnoxious to the moral censure of the world take the message as letter of instruction then minister at paris feel require to assume the same ground in a remonstrance which feel to be duty to present to mr. guizot and through to the|king|of|the french against what have be call the quintuple treaty and conduct in this respect meet with the approval of this government in close conformity with these view the eighth article of the treaty be frame which provide that each nation shall keep afloat in the african sea a force not less|than|80 gun to act separately and apart under instruction from respective government and for the enforcement of respective law and obligation from this will be see that the ground assume in the message have be fully maintain at the same time that the stipulation of the treaty of ghent be to be carry out in good faith by the country and that all pretense be remove for interference with commerce for any purpose whatever by a foreign government while therefore the|united|state have be stand up for the freedom of the sea have not think proper to make that a pretext for avoid a fulfillment of treaty stipulation or a ground for give countenance to a trade reprobate by law a similar arrangement by the other great power could not fail to sweep from the ocean the slave trade without the interpolation of any new principle into the maritime code may be permit to hope that the example thus set will be follow by some if not all of thereby also afford suitable protection to the fair trader in those sea thus fulfil at the same time the dictate of a sound policy and comply with the claim of justice and humanity would have furnish additional cause for congratulation if the treaty could have embrace all subject calculate in future to lead to a misunderstanding between the government the|territory|of the|united|state commonly call the|oregon|territory lie on the|pacific|ocean north of the second degree of latitude to a portion of which great|britain lay claim begin to attract the attention of fellow citizen and the tide of population which have reclaim what be so lately an unbroken wilderness in more contiguous region be prepare to flow over those vast district which stretch from the|rocky|mountain to in advance of the acquirement of individual right to these land sound policy dictate that every effort should be resort to by the government to settle respective claim become manifest at of the late negotiation that any attempt for the time be satisfactorily to determine those right would lead to a protract discussion which may embrace in failure other more pressing matter and the executive do not regard as proper to waive all the advantage of an honorable adjustment of other difficulty of great magnitude and importance because this not so immediately press stand in the way although the difficulty refer to may not for several|year to come involve the peace of the country yet shall not delay to urge on great|britain the importance of early settlement nor will other matter of commercial importance to the country be overlook and have good reason to believe that will comport with the policy of england as do with that of the|united|state to seize upon this moment when most of the cause of irritation have pass away to cement the peace and amity of the country by wisely remove all ground of probable future collision with the other power of europe relation continue on the most amicable footing treaty now exist with should be rigidly observe and every opportunity compatible with the interest of the|united|state should be seize upon to enlarge the basis of commercial intercourse peace with all the world be the true foundation of policy which can only be render permanent by the practice of equal and impartial justice to all great desire should be to enter only into that rivalry which look to the general good in the cultivation of the science the enlargement of the field for the exercise of the mechanical art and the spread of commerce that great civilizer to every land and sea carefully abstain from interference in all question exclusively refer to the political interest of europe may be permit to hope an equal exemption from the interference of european|government in what relate to the states of the american continent on the|23d|of|april last the commissioner on the part of the|united|state under the convention with the|mexican|republic of the 11th of april make to the proper department a final report in relation to the proceeding of the commission from this appear that the total amount award to the claimant by the commissioner and the umpire appoint under that convention be the arbiter have consider that function be require by the convention to terminate at the same time with those of the commissioner return to the board undecided for want of time claim which have be allow by the american commissioner to the amount of 928,620.88 other claim in which the amount seek to be recover be be submit to the board too late for consideration the minister of the|united|state at mexico have be duly authorize to make demand for payment of the award accord to the term of the convention and the provision of the act of congress of the|12th|of|june,|1840 have also be instruct to communicate to that government the expectation of in relation to those claim which be not dispose of accord to the provision of the convention and all other of citizen of the|united|state against the|mexican|government have also be furnish with other instruction to be follow by in case the government|of|mexico should not find in a condition to make present payment of the amount of the award in specie or equivalent be happy to be able to say that information which be esteem favorable both to a just satisfaction of the award and a reasonable provision for other claim have be recently receive from mr. thompson the minister of the|united|state who have promptly and efficiently execute the instruction of government in regard to this important subject the citizen of the|united|state who accompany the late texan expedition to santa|fe and who be wrongfully take and hold as prisoner of war in mexico have all be liberate a correspondence have take place between the|department|of|state and the mexican minister of foreign affair upon the complaint of mexico that citizen of the|united|state be permit to give aid to the inhabitant of texas in the war exist between and that republic copy of this correspondence be herewith communicate to congress together with copy of letter on the same subject address to the diplomatic corps at mexico by the american minister and the mexican secretary of state mexico have think proper to reciprocate the mission of the|united|state to that government by accredit to this a minister of the same rank as that of the representative of the|united|state in mexico from the circumstance connect with mission favorable result be anticipate from be so obviously for the interest of both country as neighbor and friend that all just cause of mutual dissatisfaction should be remove that be to be hope neither will omit or delay the employment of any practicable and honorable mean to accomplish that end the affair pende between this government and several other of the states of this hemisphere formerly under the dominion of spain have again within the|past|year be materially obstruct by the military revolution and conflict in those country the ratification of the treaty between the|united|state and the|republic|of|ecuador of the|13th|of|june,|1839 have be exchange and that instrument have be duly promulgate on the part of this government copy be now communicate to congress with a view to enable that body to make such change in the law applicable to intercourse with that republic as may be deem requisite provision have be make by the|government|of|chile for the payment of the claim on account of the illegal detention of the brig warrior at coquimbo in this government have reason to expect that other claim of citizen against chile will be hasten to a final and satisfactory close the|empire|of|brazil have not be altogether exempt from those convulsion which so constantly afflict the neighboring republic disturbance which recently break out be however now understand to be quiet but these occurrence by threaten the stability of the government or by cause incessant and violent change in or in the person who administer tend greatly to retard provision for a just indemnity for loss and injury suffer by individual subject or citizen of other state the|government|of|the|united|state will feel to be duty however to consent to no delay not unavoidable in make satisfaction for wrong and injury sustain by own citizen many|years have in some case elapse a decisive and effectual course of proceeding will be demand of the respective government against whom claim have be prefer the vexatious harass and expensive war which so long prevail with the indian tribe inhabit the peninsula of florida have happily be terminate whereby army have be relieve from a service of the most disagreeable character and the treasury from a large expenditure some casual outbreak may occur such as be incident to the close proximity of border settler and the indians but these as in all other case may be leave to the care of the local authority aid when occasion may require by the force of the|united|state a sufficient number of troop will be maintain in florida so long as the remote apprehension of danger shall exist yet duty will be limit rather to the garrisoning of the necessary post than to the maintenance of active hostility be to be hope that a territory so long retard in growth will now speedily recover from the evil incident to a protract war exhibit in the increase amount of rich production true evidence of return wealth and prosperity by the practice of rigid justice toward the numerous indian tribe reside within territorial limit and the exercise of a parental vigilance over interest protect against fraud and intrusion and at the same time use every proper expedient to introduce among the art of civilized life may fondly hope not only to wean from love of war but to inspire with a love for peace and all avocation with several of the tribe great progress in civilize have already be make the schoolmaster and the missionary be find side by side and the remnant of what be once numerous and powerful nation may yet be preserve as the builder up of a new name for and posterity the balance in the treasury on the|1st|of|january,|1842 exclusive of the amount deposit with the states trust fund and indemnity be the receipt into the treasury during the|three|first|quarters|of|the|present|year from all source amount to of which more|than|fourteen|million be receive from custom and about|one|million from the public land the receipt for the|fourth|quarter be estimate at nearly|eight|millions of which four|million be expect from custom and three|millions|and|a|half from loan and treasury note the expenditure of the|first|three|quarters|of|the|present|year exceed six|million and those estimate for the|fourth|quarter amount to about|eight|millions and be anticipate there will be a deficiency of on the|1st|of|january next but that the amount of outstanding warrant estimate at will leave an actual balance of about|$224,000 in the treasury among the expenditure of this|year be more|than|eight|million for the public debt and about|$600,000 on account of the distribution to of the proceed of sale of the public land the present tariff of duty be somewhat hastily and hurriedly pass near the close of the late session of congress that should have defect can therefore be surprising to no one to remedy such defect as may be find to exist in any of numerous provision will not fail to claim serious attention may well merit inquiry whether the exaction of all duty in cash do not call for the introduction of a system which have prove highly beneficial in country where have be adopt refer to the warehouse system the first and most prominent effect which would produce would be to protect the market alike against redundant or deficient supply of foreign fabric both of which in the long run be injurious as well to the manufacturer as the importer the quantity of good in store being at all time readily know would enable the importer with an approach to accuracy to ascertain the actual want of the market and to regulate accordingly if however should fall into error by import an excess above the public want could readily correct evil by avail of the benefit and advantage of the system thus establish in the storehouse the good import would await the demand of the market and issue would be govern by the fix principle of demand and supply thus an approximation would be make to a steadiness and uniformity of price which if attainable would conduce to the decided advantage of mercantile and mechanical operation the apprehension may be well entertain that without something to ameliorate the rigor of cash payment the entire import trade may fall into the hand of a few wealthy capitalist in this country and in europe the small importer who require all the money can raise for investment abroad and who can but ill afford to pay the low duty would have to subduct in advance a portion of fund in order to pay the duty and would lose the interest upon the amount thus pay for all the time the good may remain unsold which may absorb profit the rich capitalist abroad as well as at home would thus possess after a short time an almost exclusive monopoly of the import trade and law design for the benefit of all would thus operate for the benefit of a few a result wholly uncongenial with the spirit of institution and antirepublican in all tendency the warehouse system would enable the importer to watch the market and to select own time for offer good for sale a profitable portion of the carry trade in article enter for the benefit of drawback must also be most seriously affect without the adoption of some expedient to relieve the cash system the warehouse system would afford that relief since the carrier would have a safe recourse to the public storehouse and may without advance the duty reship within some reasonable period to foreign port a further effect of the measure would be to supersede the system of drawback thereby effectually protect the government against fraud as the right of debenture would not attach to good after withdrawal from the public store in revise the exist tariff of duty should deem proper to do so at present session can only repeat the suggestion and recommendation which upon several occasion have heretofore feel to be duty to offer to congress the great primary and control interest of the american people be union union not only in the mere form of government form which may be break but union round in an attachment of states and individual for each other this union in sentiment and feeling can only be preserve by the adoption of that course of policy which neither give exclusive benefit to some nor impose unnecessary burthen upon other shall consult the interest of all by pursue a course of moderation and thereby seek to harmonize public opinion and cause the people everywhere to feel and to know that the government be careful of the interest of all alike nor be there any subject in regard to which moderation connect with a wise discrimination be more necessary than in the imposition of duty on import whether reference be have to revenue the primary object in the imposition of taxis or to the incident which necessarily flow from imposition this be entirely true extravagant duty defeat end and object not only by exciting in the public mind an hostility to the manufacturing interest but by induce a system of smuggling on an extensive scale and the practice of every manner of fraud upon the revenue which the utmost vigilance of government can not effectually suppress an opposite course of policy would be attend by result essentially different of which every interest of society and none more than those of the manufacturer would reap important advantage among the most striking of benefit would be that derive from the general acquiescence of the country in support and the consequent permanency and stability which would be give to all the operation of industry can not be too often repeat that no system of legislation can be wise which be fluctuate and uncertain no interest can thrive under the prudent capitalist will never adventure capital in manufacturing establishment or in any other lead pursuit of life if there exist a state of uncertainty as to whether the government will repeal to morrow what have enact to day fitful profit however high if threaten with a ruinous reduction by a vacillating policy on the part of government will scarcely tempt to trust the money which have acquire by a life of labor upon the uncertain adventure therefore in the spirit of conciliation and influence by no other desire than to rescue the great interest of the country from the vortex of political contention and in the discharge of the high and solemn duty of the place which now occupy recommend moderate duty impose with a wise discrimination as to several object as be not only most likely to be durable but most advantageous to every interest of society the report of the secretary of the|war|department exhibit a very full and satisfactory account of the various and important interest commit to the charge of that officer be particularly gratify to find that the expenditure for the military service be greatly reduce in amount that a strict system of economy have be introduce into the service and the abuse of past year greatly reform the fortification on maritime frontier have be prosecute with much vigor and at many point defense be in a very considerable state of forwardness the suggestion in reference to the establishment of mean of communication with territory on the pacific and to the survey so essential to a knowledge of the resource of the intermediate country be entitle to the most favorable consideration while would propose nothing inconsistent with friendly negotiation to settle the extent of claim in that region yet a prudent forecast point out the necessity of such measure as may enable to maintain right the arrangement make for preserve neutral relation on the boundary between and texas and keep in check the indians in that|quarter will be maintain so long as circumstance may require for several|year angry contention have grow out of the disposition direct by law to be make of the mineral land hold by the government in several of the|state the government be constitute the landlord and the citizens of the states wherein lie the land be tenant the relation be an unwise one and would be much more conducive of the public interest that a sale of the land should be make than that should remain in present condition the supply of the ore would be more abundantly and certainly furnish when to be draw from the enterprise and the industry of the proprietor than under the present system the recommendation of the secretary in regard to the improvement of the western water and certain prominent harbor on the lakes merit and doubt not will receive serious attention the great importance of these subject to the prosperity of the extensive region refer to and the security of the whole country in time of war can not escape observation the loss of life and property which annually occur in the navigation of the mississippi alone because of the dangerous obstruction in the river make a loud demand upon congress for the adoption of efficient measure for removal the report of the secretary of the navy will bring acquaint with that important branch of the public defense consider the already vast and daily increase commerce of the country apart from the exposure to hostile inroad of an extended seaboard all that relate to the navy be calculate to excite particular attention whatever tend to add to efficiency without entail unnecessary charge upon the treasury be well worthy of serious consideration will be see that while an appropriation exceed by more|than|a|million the appropriation of the|current|year be ask by the secretary yet that in this sum be propose to be include for the purchase of clothing which when once expend will be annually reimburse by the sale of the clothe and will thus constitute a perpetual fund without any new appropriation to the same object to this may also be add ask to cover the arrearage of past|years and in order to maintain a competent squadron on the coast of africa all of which when deduct will reduce the expenditure nearly within the limit of those of the|current|year while however the expenditure will thus remain very nearly the same as of the|antecedent|year be propose to add greatly to the operation of the marine and in lieu of only|25 ship in commission and but little in the way of building to keep with the same expenditure vessel afloat and to build ship of a small class a strict system of accountability be establish and great pain be take to insure industry fidelity and economy in every department of duty experiment have be institute to test the quality of various material particularly copper iron and coal so as to prevent fraud and imposition will appear by the report of the|postmaster general that the great point which for several|year have be so much desire have during the|current|year be fully accomplish the expenditure of the department for current service have be bring within income without lessen general usefulness there have be an increase of revenue equal to for the|year|1842 over that of without as be believe any addition have be make to the number of letter and newspaper transmit through the mail the post - office law have be honestly administer and fidelity have be observe in account for and pay over by the subordinate of the department the money which have be receive for the detail of the service refer to the report flatter that the exhibition thus make of the condition of the public administration will serve to convince that every proper attention have be pay to the interest of the country by those who have be call to the head of the different departments the reduction in the annual expenditure of the government already accomplish furnishe a sure evidence that economy in the application of the public money be regard as a paramount duty at peace with all the world the personal liberty of the citizen sacredly maintain and right secure under political institution derive all authority from the direct sanction of the people with a soil fertile almost beyond example and a country bless with every diversity of climate and production what remain to be do in order to advance the happiness and prosperity of such a people under ordinary circumstance this inquiry could readily be answer the good that probably could be do for a people inhabit such a country would be to fortify peace and security in the prosecution of various pursuit by guard against invasion from without and violence from within the rest for the great part may be leave to own energy and enterprise the chief embarrassment which at the moment exhibit have arise from overaction and the most difficult task which remain to be accomplish be that of correct and overcome effect between|the|years|1833 and addition be make to bank capital and bank issue in the form of note design for circulation to an extent enormously great the question seem to be not how the good currency could be provide but in what manner the great amount of bank paper could be put in circulation thus a vast amount of what be call money since for the time be answer the purpose of money be throw upon the country an overissue which be attend as a necessary consequence by an extravagant increase of the price of all article of property the spread of a speculative mania all over the country and have finally end in a general indebtedness on the part of states and individual the prostration of public and private credit a depreciation in the market value of real and personal estate and have leave large district of country almost entirely without any circulate medium in view of the fact that in the whole bank note circulation within the|united|state amount to but accord to the treasury statement and that an addition have be make thereto of the enormous sum of in seven|year the circulation on the|1st|of|january,|1837 be state at aid by the great facility afford in obtain loan from european capitalist who be seize with the same speculative mania which prevail in the|united|state and the large importation of fund from abroad the result of stock sale and loan no one can be surprised at the apparent but unsubstantial state of prosperity which everywhere prevail over the land and as little cause of surprise should be feel at the present prostration of everything and the ruin which have befall so many of fellow citizen in the sudden withdrawal from circulation of so large an amount of bank issue since as be believe the amount add to the paper currency for a similar period antecedent to -it cease to be a matter of astonishment that such extensive shipwreck should have be make of private fortune or that difficulty should exist in meet engagement on the part of the debtor states apart from which if there be take into account the immense loss sustain in the dishonor of numerous bank be less a matter of surprise that insolvency should have visit many of fellow citizen than that so many should have escape the blighting influence of the time in the solemn conviction of these truth and with an ardent desire to meet the press necessity of the country feel to be duty to cause to be submit to at the commencement of last session the plan of an exchequer the whole power and duty of maintain which in purity and vigor be to be exercise by the representative of the people and the states and therefore virtually by the people be propose to place under the control and direction of a treasury board to consist of commissioner whose duty should be to see that the law of creation be faithfully execute and that the great end of supply a paper medium of exchange at all time convertible into gold and silver should be attain the board thus constitute be give as much permanency as could be impart to without endanger the proper share of responsibility which should attach to all public agent in order to insure all the advantage of a well matured experience the commissioner be to hold office for the respective period of and six|year thereby secure at all time in the management of the exchequer the service of man of experience and to place in a condition to exercise perfect independence of mind and action be provide that removal should only take place for actual incapacity or infidelity to the trust and to be follow by the president with an exposition of the cause of such removal should occur be propose to establish subordinate board in each of the states under the same restriction and limitation of the power of removal which with the central board should receive safely keep and disburse the public money and in order to furnish a sound paper medium of exchange the exchequer should retain of the revenue of the government a sum not to exceed in specie to be set apart as require by operation and to pay the public creditor at own option either in specie or treasury note of denomination not less|than|$5 nor exceed which note should be redeem at the several place of issue and to be receivable at all time and everywhere in payment of government due with a restraint upon such issue of bill that the same should not exceed the maximum of in order to guard against all the hazard incident to fluctuation in trade the secretary of the treasury be invest with authority to issue of government stock should the same at any time be regard as necessary in order to place beyond hazard the prompt redemption of the bill which may be throw into circulation thus in fact make the issue of of exchequer bill rest substantially on and keep in circulation never more than and half|dollar for every dollar in specie when to this be add that the bill be not only everywhere receivable in government due but that the government would be bind for ultimate redemption no rational doubt can exist that the paper which the exchequer would furnish would readily enter into general circulation and be maintain at all time at or above par with gold and silver thereby realize the great want of the age and fulfil the wish of the people in order to reimburse the government the expense of the plan be propose to invest the exchequer with the limited authority to deal in bill of exchange unless prohibit by the state in which an agency may be situate have only|thirty|days to run and rest on a fair and bona fide basis the legislative will on this point may be so plainly announce as to avoid all pretext for partiality or favoritism be furthermore propose to invest this treasury agent with authority to receive on deposit to a limited amount the specie fund of individual and to grant certificate therefor to be redeem on presentation under the idea which be believe to be well found that such certificate would come in aid of the exchequer bill in supply a safe and ample paper circulation or if in place of the contemplate dealing in exchange the exchequer should be authorize not only to exchange bill for actual deposit of specie but for specie or equivalent to sell draft charge therefor a small but reasonable premium can not doubt but that the benefit of the law would be speedily manifest in the revival of the credit trade and business of the whole country entertain this opinion become duty to urge adoption upon congress by reference to the strong consideration of the public interest with such alteration in detail as congress may in wisdom see fit to make be well aware that this propose alteration and amendment of the law establish the|treasury|department have encounter various objection and that among other have be proclaim a government bank of fearful and dangerous import be propose to confer upon no extraordinary power purport to do no more than pay the debt of the government with the redeemable paper of the government in which respect accomplish precisely what the treasury do daily at this time in issue to the public creditor the treasury note which under law be authorize to issue have no resemblance to an ordinary bank as furnish no profit to private stockholder and lend no capital to individual if be object to as a government bank and the objection be available then should all the law in relation to the treasury be repeal and the capacity of the government to collect what be due to or pay what owe be abrogate this be the chief purpose of the propose exchequer and surely if in the accomplishment of a purpose so essential afford a sound circulate medium to the country and facility to trade should be regard as no slight recommendation of to public consideration properly guard by the provision of law can run into no dangerous evil nor can any abuse arise under but such as the legislature will be answerable for if be tolerate since be but the creature of the law and be susceptible at all time of modification amendment or repeal at the pleasure of congress know that have be object that the system would be liable to be abuse by the legislature by whom alone could be abuse in the party conflict of the|day that such abuse would manifest in a change of the law which would authorize an excessive issue of paper for the purpose of inflate price and win popular favor to that may be answer that the ascription of such a motive to congress be altogether gratuitous and inadmissible the theory of institution would lead to a different conclusion but a perfect security against a proceeding so reckless would be find to exist in the very nature of thing the political party which should be so blind to the true interest of the country as to resort to such an expedient would inevitably meet with final overthrow in the fact that the moment the paper cease to be convertible into specie or otherwise promptly redeem would become worthless and would in the end dishonor the government involve the people in ruin and such political party in hopeless disgrace at the same time such a view involve the utter impossibility of furnish any currency other than that of the precious metal for if the government can not forego the temptation of excessive paper issue what reliance can be place in corporation upon whom the temptation of individual aggrandizement would most strongly operate the people would have to blame none but for any injury that may arise from a course so reckless since agent would be the wrongdoer and the passive spectator there can be but kind of public currency first gold and silver the paper of state institution or third a representative of the precious metal provide by the|general|government or under authority the subtreasury system reject the last in any form and as be believe that no reliance could be place on the issue of local institution for the purpose of general circulation necessarily and unavoidably adopt specie as the exclusive currency for own use and this must ever be the case unless of the other kind be use the choice in the present state of public sentiment lie between an exclusive specie currency on the hand and government issue of some kind on the other that these issue can not be make by a charter institution be suppose to be conclusively settle must be make then directly by government agent for several|year past have be thus make in the form of treasury note and have answer a valuable purpose usefulness have be limit by be transient and temporary ceasing to bear interest at give period necessarily cause speedy return and thus restrict range of circulation and be use only in the disbursement of government can not reach those point where be most require by render use permanent to the moderate extent already mention by offer no inducement for return and by exchange for coin and other value will constitute to a certain extent the general currency so much need to maintain the internal trade of the country and this be the exchequer plan so far as may operate in furnish a currency can not forego the occasion to urge importance to the credit of the government in a financial point of view the great necessity of resort to every proper and become expedient in order to place the treasury on a footing of the high respectability be entirely obvious the credit of the government may be regard as the very soul of the government a principle of vitality without which all movement be languid and all operation embarrass in this spirit the executive feel bind by the most imperative sense of duty to submit to congress at last session the propriety of make a specific pledge of the land fund as the basis for the negotiation of the loan authorize to be contract then think that such an application of the public domain would without doubt have place at the command of the government ample fund to relieve the treasury from the temporary embarrassment under which labor american credit have suffer a considerable shock in europe from the large indebtedness of the states and the temporary inability of some of to meet the interest on debt the utter and disastrous prostration of the|united|states|bank|of|pennsylvania have contribute largely to increase the sentiment of distrust by reason of the loss and ruin sustain by the holder of stock a large portion of whom be foreigner and many of whom be alike ignorant of political organization and of actual responsibility be the anxious desire of the executive that in the effort to negotiate the loan abroad the american negotiator may be able to point the money lender to the fund mortgage for the redemption of the principal and interest of any loan may contract and thereby vindicate the government from all suspicion of bad faith or inability to meet engagement congress differ from the executive in this view of the subject become nevertheless the duty of the executive to resort to every expedient in power to do so after a failure in the american market a citizen of high character and talent be send to europe with no well success and thus the mortify spectacle have be present of the inability of this government to obtain a loan so small as not in the whole to amount to fourth of ordinary annual income at a time when the|governments|of|europe although involve in debt and with subject heavily burthen with taxation readily obtain loan of any amount at a greatly reduce rate of interest would be unprofitable to look further into this anomalous state of thing but can not conclude without add that for a government which have pay off debt of war with the large maritime power of europe and now owe a debt which be almost next to nothing when compare with boundless resource a government the strong in the world because emanate from the popular will and firmly root in the affection of a great and free people and whose fidelity to engagement have never be question for such a government to have tender to the capitalist of other country an opportunity for a small investment in stock and yet to have fail imply either the most unfounded distrust in good faith or a purpose to obtain which the course pursue be the most fatal which could have be adopt have now become obvious to all man that the government must look to own mean for supply want and be console to know that these mean be altogether adequate for the object the exchequer if adopt will greatly aid in bring about this result upon what regard as a well rounded supposition that bill would be readily seek for by the public creditor and that the issue would in a short time reach the maximum of be obvious that would thereby be add to the available mean of the treasury without cost or charge nor can fail to urge the great and beneficial effect which would be produce in aid of all the active pursuit of life effect upon the solvent state bank while would force into liquidation those of an opposite character through weekly settlement would be highly beneficial and with the advantage of a sound currency the restoration of confidence and credit would follow with a numerous train of blessing conviction be most strong that these benefit would flow from the adoption of this measure but if the result should be adverse there be this security in connection with that the law create may be repeal at the pleasure of the legislature without the slight implication of good faith recommend to congress to take into consideration the propriety of reimburse a fine impose on general jackson at new|orleans at the time of the attack and defense of that city and pay by without design any reflection on the judicial tribunal which impose the fine the remission at this|day may be regard as not unjust or inexpedient the voice of the civil authority be hear amidst the glitter of arm and obey by those who hold the sword thereby give additional luster to a memorable military achievement if the law be offend majesty be fully vindicate and although the penalty incur and pay be worthy of little regard in a pecuniary point of view can hardly be doubt that would be gratify to the war wear veteran now in retirement and in to be relieve from the circumstance in which that judgment place there be case in which public functionary may be call on to weigh the public interest against own personal hazard and if the civil law be violate from praiseworthy motif or an overrule sense of public danger and public necessity punishment may well be restrain within that limit which assert and maintain the authority of the law and the subjection of the military to the civil power the defense of new|orleans while save a city from the hand of the enemy place the name of general jackson among those of the great captain of the age and illustrate of the bright page of history now that the cause of excitement exist at the time have cease to operate be believe that the remission of this fine and whatever of gratification that remission may cause the eminent man who incur and pay would be in accordance with the general feeling and wish of the american people have thus fellow citizen acquit of duty under the constitution by lay before as succinctly as have be able the state of the union and by invite attention to measure of much importance to the country the executive will most zealously unite effort with those of the legislative department in the accomplishment of all that be require to relieve the want of a common constituency or elevate the destiny of a beloved country transcript to the senate of the|united|state transmit to the senate for consideration with a view to ratification a treaty of amity commerce and navigation with the|republic|of|texas negotiate at the seat of government|of the united states between the secretary of state duly empower for that purpose and the charge d'affaire of that republic in form the first commercial treaty between the government an anxious desire have be feel to introduce such provision as should promote the interest of both country the immediate proximity of texas to the|united|state and the consequent facility of intercourse the nature of principal agricultural production and the relation which both country bear to several large river which be boundary between and which in some part of course run within the territory of both have cause peculiarity of condition and interest which have be necessary to guard the treaty provide that texas shall enjoy a right of deposit for such of production as may be introduce into the|united|state for exportation but upon the condition that the|executive|of the|united|state may prescribe such regulation as may be necessary for the proper enjoyment of the privilege within territory be think no more than reasonable to grant this facility to the trade of texas under such condition as seem best calculate to guard against abuse or inconvenience the treaty further provide that raw cotton may be import from either country into the other free of duty in general be not wise to enter into treaty stipulation respect duty of import be usually much better leave to the operation of general law but there be circumstance exist in this case which have be think to justify a departure from the general rule and the addition of to the number of instance not large in which regulation of duty of import have be make the subject of national compact the|united|state consume large quantity of raw cotton but be exporter of the article to a still great extent texas for the present at least export whole crop these exportation be in general to the same foreign market and be suppose to be of no considerable importance to the american producer whether meet the texan product at home or abroad on the other hand be think that a useful commercial intercourse would be promote in several way by receive the raw cotton of texas at once into the|united|state free of duty the tendency of such a measure be to bring to the|united|state in the first instance texan cotton ultimately destine to european market the natural effect of this be suppose will be to increase the business of the city of the|united|state to the extent of this importation and exportation and to secure a further degree of employment to the navigation of the country but these be by no means all the benefit which may be reasonably expect from the arrangement texas at least for a considerable time to come must import all the manufacture article and much of the supply and provision necessary for use and consumption these commodity will be likely to obtain if to be have in the market of the country in which dispose of main annual product the manufacture of the north and east therefore and the grain and provision of the|western|state be likely to find in texas a demand increase by whatever augment intercourse between the country and especially by whatever tend to give attraction to the city of the|united|state as mart for the sale of great and principal article of export as a security however against unforeseen result or occurrence have be think advisable to give this article of the treaty a limitation of five|year transcript to the senate of the|united|state have the satisfaction to communicate to the senate the result of the negotiation recently have in this city with the british minister special and extraordinary these result comprise-- first a treaty to settle and define the boundary between the territory of the|united|state and the possession of her|britannic|majesty in north|america for the suppression of the african slave trade and the surrender of criminal fugitive from justice in certain case second a correspondence on the subject of the interference of the colonial authority of the|british|west|indies with american merchant vessel drive by stress of weather or carry by violence into the port of those colony third a correspondence upon the subject of the attack and destruction of the steamboat caroline fourth a correspondence on the subject of impressment if this treaty shall receive the approbation of the senate will terminate a difference respect boundary which have long subsist between the government have be the subject of several ineffectual attempt at settlement and have sometimes lead to great irritation not without danger of disturb the exist peace both the|united|state and the|state more immediately concerned have entertain no doubt of the validity of the american title to all the territory which have be in dispute but that title be controvert and the|government|of|the|united|state have agree to make the dispute a subject of arbitration arbitration have be actually have but have fail to settle the controversy and be find at the commencement of last|year that a correspondence have be in progress between the government for a joint commission with an ultimate reference to an umpire or arbitrator with authority to make a final decision that correspondence however have be retard by various occurrence and have come to no definite result when the special mission of lord|ashburton be announce this movement on the part of england afford in the judgment of the executive a favorable opportunity for make an attempt to settle this long exist controversy by some agreement or treaty without further reference to arbitration seem entirely proper that if this purpose be entertain consultation should be have with the authority of the|states|of|maine and massachusetts letter therefore of which copy be herewith communicate be address to the governor of those states suggest that commissioner should be appoint by each of respectively to repair to this city and confer with the authority of this government on a line by agreement or compromise with equivalent and compensation this suggestion be meet by both states in a spirit of candor and patriotism and promptly comply with commissioner on the part of maine and on the part of massachusetts all person of distinction and high character be duly appoint and commission and lose no time in present at the seat of the|government|of|the|united|state these commissioner have be in correspondence with this government during the period of the discussion have enjoy confidence and free communication have aid the general object with counsel and advice and in the end have unanimously signify assent to the line propose in the treaty ordinarily would be no easy task to reconcile and bring together such a variety of interest in a matter in difficult and perplexed but the effort of the government in attempt to accomplish this desirable object have be second and sustain by a spirit of accommodation and conciliation on the part of the states concern to which much of the success of these effort be to be ascribe connect with the settlement of the line of the northeastern boundary so far as respect the|states|of|maine and massachusetts be the continuation of that line along the highland to the northwesternmost head of connecticut|river which of the source of that stream be entitle to this character have be matter of controversy and of some interest to the|state|of|new|hampshire the|king|of|the|netherland decide the main branch to be the northwesternmost head of the connecticut this do not satisfy the claim of new|hampshire the line agree to in the present treaty follow the highland to the head of halls|stream and thence down that river embrace the whole claim of new|hampshire and establish title to of territory more than would have have by the decision of the|king|of|the|netherland by the|treaty|of|1783 the line be to proceed down the|connecticut|river to the fifth degree of north latitude and thence west by that parallel till strike the st. lawrence recent examination have ascertain that the line heretofore receive as the true line of latitude between those point be erroneous and that the correction of this error would not only leave on the british side a considerable tract of territory heretofore suppose to belong to the|states|of|vermont and new|york but also rouses|point the site of a military work of the|united|state have be regard as an object of importance not only to establish the right and jurisdiction of those states up to the line to which have be consider to extend but also to comprehend rouses|point within the territory of the|united|state the relinquishment by the|british|government of all the territory south of the line heretofore consider to be the true line have be obtain and the consideration for this relinquishment be to inure by the provision of the treaty to the|states|of|maine and massachusetts the line of boundary then from the source of the|st.|croix to the|st.|lawrence so far as maine and massachusetts be concern be fix by own consent and for consideration satisfactory to the chief of these consideration be the privilege of transport the lumber and agricultural product grow and raise in maine on the water of the|st.|johns and tributary down that river to the ocean free from imposition or disability the importance of this privilege perpetual in term to a country cover at present by pine forest of great value and much of capable hereafter of agricultural improvement be not a matter upon which the opinion of intelligent man be likely to be divide so far as new|hampshire be concern the treaty secure all that require and new|york and vermont be quiet to the extent of claim and occupation the difference which would be make in the northern boundary of these state by correct the parallel of latitude may be see on tanner 's map new atlas map nos and from the intersection of the fifth degree of north latitude with the st. lawrence and along that river and the lake to the water communication between lake|huron and lake|superior the line be definitively agree on by the commissioner of the government under the sixth article of the treaty of ghent but between this last mention point and the|lake|of|the|wood the commissioner act under the seventh article of that treaty find several matter of disagreement and therefore make no joint report to respective government the first of these be sugar|island or st.|georges|island lie in st.|marys|river or the water communication between lakes|huron and superior by the present treaty this island be embrace in the territory of the|united|state both from soil and position be regard as of much value another matter of difference be the manner of extend the line from the point at which the commissioner arrive north of isle|royale in lake|superior to the|lake|of|the|wood the british commissioner insist on proceed to fond|du|lac at the southw angle of the lake and thence by the river st.|louis to the|rainy|lake the american commissioner suppose the true course to be to proceed by way of the|dog|river attempt be make to compromise this difference but without success the detail of these proceeding be find at length in the print separate report of the commissioner from the imperfect knowledge of this remote country at the date of the treaty of peace some of the description in that treaty do not harmonize with natural feature as now ascertain long lake be nowhere to be find under that name there be reason for supposing however that the sheet of water intend by that name be the estuary at the mouth of pigeon|river the present treaty therefore adopt that estuary and river and afterwards pursue the usual route across the height of land by the various portage and small lake till the line reach rainy|lake from which the commissioner agree on the extension of to termination in the northw angle of the|lake|of|the|wood the region of country on and near the shore of the lake between pigeon|river on the north and fond|du|lac and the river st.|louis on the south and west consider valuable as a mineral region be thus include within the|united|state embrace a territory of 4,000,000|acre northward of the claim set up by the british commissioner under the treaty of ghent from the height of land at the head of pigeon|river westerly to the|rainy|lake the country be understand to be of little value be describe by surveyor and mark on the map as a region of rock and water from the northw angle of the|lake|of|the|wood which be find to be in latitude north exist treaty require the line to be run due south to intersection with the fifth parallel and thence along that parallel to the|rocky|mountain after sundry informal communication with the british minister upon the subject of the claim of the country to territory west of the|rocky|mountain so little probability be find to exist of come to any agreement on that subject at present that be not think expedient to make of the subject of formal negotiation to be enter upon between this government and the british minister as part of duty under special mission by the|treaty|of|1783 the line of division along the river and lake from the place where the fifth parallel of north latitude strike the st. lawrence to the outlet of lake|superior be invariably to be draw through the middle of such water and not through the middle of main channel such a line if extend accord to the literal term of the treaty would be obvious occasionally intersect island the manner in which the commissioner of the government deal with this difficult subject may be see in report but where the line thus follow the middle of the river or water course do not meet with island yet be liable sometimes to leave the only practicable navigable channel altogether on side the treaty make no provision for the common use of the water by the citizen and subject of both country have happen therefore in a few instance that the use of the river in particular place would be greatly diminish to party or the other if in fact there be not a choice in the use of channel and passage thus at the|long|sault in the|st.|lawrence a dangerous passage practicable only for boat the only safe run be between the|long|sault|islands and barnharts|island all which belong to on side and the american shore on the other on the other hand by far the good passage for vessel of any depth of water from lake|erie into the|detroit|river be between bois|blanc a british island and the canadian shore so again there be several channel or passage of different degree of facility and usefulness between the several island in the river st.|clair at or near entry into the lake of that name in these case the treaty provide that all the several passage and channel shall be free and open to the use of the citizen and subject of both party the treaty obligation subsist between the country for the suppression of the african slave trade and the complaint make to this government within the|last|three|or|four|years many of but too well found of the visitation seizure and detention of american vessel on that coast by british cruiser could not but form a delicate and highly important part of the negotiation which have now be hold the early and prominent part which the|government|of|the|united|state have take for the abolition of this unlawful and inhuman traffic be well know by the tenth article of the treaty of ghent be declare that the traffic in slave be irreconcilable with the principle of humanity and justice and that both majesty and the|united|state be desirous of continue effort to promote entire abolition and be thereby agree that both the contracting party shall use good endeavor to accomplish so desirable an object the|government|of the|united|state have by law declare the african slave trade piracy and at suggestion other nation have make similar enactment have not be want in honest and zealous effort make in conformity with the wish of the whole country to accomplish the entire abolition of the traffic in slave upon the african coast but these effort and those of other country direct to the same end have prove to a considerable degree unsuccessful treaty be know to have be enter into between england and france by which the former power which usually maintain a large naval force on the african station be authorize to seize and bring in for adjudication vessel find engage in the slave trade under the french flag be know that in december last a treaty be sign in london by the representative of england france russia prussia and austria have for professed object a strong and united effort of the power to put an end to the traffic this treaty be not officially communicate to but provision and stipulation be suppose to be accurately know to the public be understand to be not yet ratify on the part of france no application or request have be make to this government to become party to this treaty but the course may take in regard to have exalt no small degree of attention and discussion in europe as the principle upon which be found and the stipulation which contain have cause warm animadversion and great political excitement in message at the commencement of the present session of congress endeavor to state the principle which this government support respect the right of search and the immunity of flag desirous of maintain those principle fully at the same time that exist obligation should be fulfil have think most consistent with the honor and dignity of the country that should execute own law and perform own obligation by own mean and own power the examination or visitation of the merchant vessel of nation by the cruiser of another for any purpose except those know and acknowledge by the law of nation under whatever restraint or regulation may take place may lead to dangerous result be far well by other mean to supersede any suppose necessity or any motive for such examination or visit interference with a merchant vessel by an armed cruiser be always a delicate proceeding apt to touch the point of national honor as well as to affect the interest of individual have be think therefore expedient not only in accordance with the stipulation of the treaty of ghent but at the same time as remove all pretext on the part of other for violate the immunity of the american flag upon the sea as exist and be define by the law of nation to enter into the article now submit to the senate the treaty which now submit to propose no alteration mitigation or modification of the rule of the law of nation provide simply that each of the government shall maintain on the coast of africa a sufficient squadron to enforce separately and respectively the law right and obligation of the country for the suppression of the slave trade another consideration of great importance have recommend this mode of fulfil the duty and obligation of the country commerce along the western coast of africa be extensive and suppose to be increase there be reason to think that in many case those engage in have meet with interruption and annoyance cause by the jealousy and instigation of rival engage in the same trade many complaint on this subject have reach the government a respectable naval force on the coast be the natural resort and security against further occurrence of this kind the surrender to justice of person who have commit high crime seek an asylum in the territory of a neighboring nation would seem to be an act due to the cause of general justice and properly belong to the present state of civilization and intercourse the|british|provinces|of|north|america be separate from of the union by a line of several|thousand|miles and along portion of this line the amount of population on either side be quite considerable while the passage of the boundary be always easy offender against the law on the side transfer to the other sometimes with great difficulty be bring to justice but very often wholly escape a consciousness of immunity from the power of avoid justice in this way instigate the unprincipled and reckless to the commission of offense and the peace and good neighborhood of the border be consequently often disturb in the case of offender flee from canada into the|united|state the governor of states be often apply to for surrender and question of a very embarrassing nature arise from these application have be think highly important therefore to provide for the whole case by a proper treaty stipulation the article on the subject in the propose treaty be carefully confine to such offense as all mankind agree to regard as heinous and destructive of the security of life and property in this careful and specific enumeration of crime the object have be to exclude all political offense or criminal charge arise from war or intestine commotion treason misprision of treason libel desertion from military service and other offense of similar character be exclude and lest some unforeseen inconvenience or unexpected abuse should arise from the stipulation render continuance in the opinion of or both of the party not longer desirable be leave in the power of either to put an end to at will the destruction of the steamboat caroline at schlosser four|or|five|years|ago occasion no small degree of excitement at the time and become the subject of correspondence between the government that correspondence have be suspend for a considerable period be renew in the|spring|of|the|last|year but no satisfactory result have be arrive at be think proper though the occurrence have cease to be fresh and recent not to omit attention to on the present occasion have only be so far discuss in the correspondence now submit as be accomplish by a violation of the territory of the|united|state the letter of the british minister while attempt to justify that violation upon the ground of a press and overrule necessity admit nevertheless that even if justifiable an apology be due for and accompany this acknowledgment with assurance of the sacred regard of government for the inviolability of national territory have seem to sufficient to warrant forbearance from any further remonstrance against what take place as an aggression on the soil and territory of the country on the subject of the interference of the british authority in the|west|indy a confident hope be entertain that the correspondence which have take place show the ground take by this government and the engagement enter into by the british minister will be find such as to satisfy the just expectation of the people of the|united|state the impressment of seamen from merchant vessel of this country by british cruiser although not practice in time of peace and therefore not at present a productive cause of difference and irritation have nevertheless hitherto be so prominent a topic of controversy and be so likely to bring on renew contention at the first break out of a european war that have be think the part of wisdom now to take into serious and earnest consideration the letter from the secretary of state to the british minister explain the ground which the government have assume and the principle which mean to uphold for the defense of these ground and the maintenance of these principle the most perfect reliance be place on the intelligence of the american people and on firmness and patriotism in whatever touch the honor of the country or great and essential interest john tyler the follow be insert because pertain to the treaty transmit with

duplicate of the map duly authenticate have be place in the british archive at london which although have not the topography of the country so fully lay down upon as be upon own represent with equal exactness the survey of the boundary should be deem expedient by this government to procure copy of access to those archive for that purpose would undoubtedly be permit and the object accomplish at small expense and when complete these copy could be authenticate by the joint commissioner in accordance with the provision of the treaty have the honor to be with great respect obedient and humble

straight line be run between along that line which pass entirely through forest monument be erect at every mile at the crossing of the principal stream and river and at the top of those hill where a transit instrument have be set up to test the straightness of the line as soon as the parallel of latitude have be determine on the|southwest|branch in the early part of the|summer|of|1844 a straight line be draw from the boundary point on the|northwest|branch to a large monument erect on the left bank of the|southwest|branch where be intersect by the parallel of latitude the line so draw crosse the southwest|branch once before reach the parallel of latitude and at about|half|a|mile distance from that parallel there also a large monument have be set up on the left bank from the intersection of the parallel the boundary ascend the southwest branch pass through a lake near head and so up a small stream which fall into the lake from the west to the source of that stream which have be select as the source of the|southwest|branch on the southwest branch there be principal fork at each of which monument have be erect on each bank of the river immediately above the fork and upon the branch establish as the boundary the map point out position at the mouth of the small stream select as the source of the southwest branch a monument have be erect upon a delta form by small outlet above those outlet other monument have be place at interval upon the same stream upon the crest of the dividing ridge very close to the source of the|southwest|branch a large monument have be erect be the first point in the highland and from the boundary run along the crest in a southerly direction pass near to the southeastern shore of the|portage|lake and so on to a large monument erect on a small

leech|lake there be a stream which divide water and flow both into canada and into the|united|state the boundary have be make to run up that stream a short distance from the fork where the water divide to a second fork thence between the stream which unite to form that fork and then to ascend again the dividing ridge a monument have be erect at the fork first mention where the water divide as the boundary approach the valley of spider|river bend to the southeast and by a wide circuit over high and steep hill turn the head of spider|river thence bend to the northwest until approach within about|4|mile of lake|megantic thence turn again south have the valley of arnolds|river on the right and of dead|river on the left leave gasford|mountain in canada thread way over very high ground

of north latitude at that point a large monument have be erect on the right and a small one on the left bank of the stream monument have also be erect along the bank of this stream as indicate on the map the line of valentine and collins be explore and find by the blaze still remain in the original forest upon cut into those blaze be see that deep seat in the tree there be a scar the surface of the original blaze slightly decay and upon count the ring which indicate each year 's growth of the tree be find that the blaze date back to and the line of valentine and collins be run in and the coincidence of the date of the blaze with those of the above line confirm by the testimony of the people of the country satisfy the undersigned that the line have find be that mention in the treaty along this portion of the boundary which be know as the fifth degree of valentine and collins and which extend from halls|stream to st.|regis there be several interruption to the blaze in those part where clearing have be make and there the authentic mark of the precise situation of the old line have be lose in those case the undersigned have draw the boundary line straight from the original blaze on the side of a clearing to the original blaze on the other side of the same clearing can not be positively state that the line as have be trace through those clearing precisely coincide with the old line but the undersigned believe that do not differ materially from nor have have the mean of determine a nearer or a sure approximation along this line at every point of deflection an iron monument have be erect also at the crossing of river lake and road those which mark deflection be place as on the north line anglewise with the line all the other be place square with the map show the

j.|b.|bucknall|estcourt lieutenant colonel h.|b.|m. commissioner of boundary albert smith united|stat commissioner transcript to the|house|of|representatives of the|united|state be with unfeigned regret that find under the necessity of return to the|house|of|representatives with objection a bill entitle an act to provide revenue from import and to change and modify exist law impose duty on import and for other purpose nothing can be more painful to any individual call upon to perform the chief executive duty under limited constitution than to be constrain to withhold assent from an important measure adopt by the legislature yet would neither fulfill the high purpose of station nor consult the true interest or the solemn will of the people the common constituent of both branch of the government by yield well consider most deeply fix and repeatedly declare opinion on matter of great public concernment to those of a coordinate department without request that department seriously to reexamine the subject of difference the exercise of some independence of judgment in regard to all act of legislation be plainly imply in the responsibility of approve at all time a duty become a peculiarly solemn and imperative when the subject pass upon by congress happen to involve as in the present instance the most momentous issue to affect variously the various part of a great country and to have give rise in all|quarter to such a conflict of opinion as to render impossible to conjecture with any certainty on which side the majority really be surely if the pause for reflection intend by the wise author of the constitution by refer the subject back to congress for reconsideration be ever expedient and necessary be precisely such a case as the present on the subject of distribute the proceed of the sale of the public land in the exist state of the finance have be duty to make known settle conviction on various occasion during the present session of congress at the opening of the extra session upward of share fully in the general hope of return prosperity and credit recommend such a distribution but that recommendation be even then expressly couple with the condition that the duty on import should not exceed the rate of provide by the compromise act of these hope be not a little encouraged and these view strengthen by the report of mr. ewing then secretary of the treasury which be shortly thereafter lay before congress in which recommend the imposition of duty at the rate of ad valorem on all free article with specify exception and state if this measure be adopt there will be receive in the treasury from custom in the|last|quarter|of|the|present|year in all|of|the|year|1842 about|$22,500,000 and in the|year|1843 after the final reduction under the act of march|2,|1833 about|$20,800,000 and add be believe that after the heavy expenditure require by the public service in the|present|year shall have be provide for the revenue which will accrue from that or a nearly approximate rate of duty will be sufficient to defray the expense of the government and leave a surplus to be annually apply to the gradual payment of the national debt leave the proceed of the public land to be dispose of as congress shall see fit be most happy that congress at the time seem entirely to concur in the recommendation of the executive and anticipate the correctness of the secretary 's conclusion and in view of an actual surplus pass the distribution act of the 4th september last wisely limit operation by condition have reference both of to a possible state of the treasury different from that which have be anticipate by the secretary of the treasury and to the paramount necessity of the public service ordain that if at any time during the existence of that act there should be an imposition of duty on import inconsistent with the provision of the act of the march,|1833 and beyond the rate of duty fix by that act to wit on the value of such import or any of then the distribution should be suspend and should continue so suspend until that cause should be remove by a previous clause have in a like spirit of wise and cautious patriotism provide for another case in which all be even now agree that the proceed of the sale of the public land should be use for the defense of the country be enact that the act should continue and be in force until otherwise provide by law unless the|united|states should become involved in war with any foreign power in which event from the commencement of hostility the act should be suspend until the cessation of hostility not long after the opening of the present session of congress the unprecedented and extraordinary difficulty that have recently embarrass the finance of the country begin to assume a serious aspect soon become quite evident that the hope under which the act of 4th september be pass and which alone justify in the eye either of congress who impose or of the executive who approve the first of the condition just recite be not destine to be fulfil under the pressure therefore of the embarrassment which have thus unexpectedly arise appear to that the course to be pursue have be clearly mark out for the government by that act the condition contemplate in as require a suspension of operation have occur become necessary in the opinion of all to raise the rate of duty upon import above and with a view both to provide available mean to meet present exigency and to lay the foundation for a successful negotiation of a loan feel incumbent on to urge upon congress to raise the duty accordingly impose in a spirit of a wise discrimination for the twofold object of afford ample revenue for the government and incidental protection to the various branch of domestic industry also press in the most emphatic but respectful language could employ the necessity of make the land sale available to the treasury as the basis of public credit do not think that could stand excuse much less justified before the people of the|united|state nor could reconcile to to recommend the imposition of additional taxis upon without at the same time urge the employment of all the legitimate mean of the government toward satisfy want these opinion be communicate in advance of any definitive action of congress on the subject either of the tariff or land sale under a high sense of public duty and in compliance with an express injunction of the constitution so that if a collision extremely to be deprecate as such collision always be have seemingly arise between the executive and legislative branch of the government have assuredly not be owe to any capricious interference or to any want of a plain and frank declaration of opinion on the part of the former congress differ in view with those of the executive as have undoubtedly a right to do and pass a bill virtually for a time repeal the proviso of the act of the 4th september,|1841 the bill be return to the house in which originate with objection to become a law with a view to prevent if possible an open disagreement of opinion on a point so important take occasion to declare that regard as an indispensable prerequisite to an increase of duty above that the act of the 4th september should remain unrepealed in provision reason for that opinion be elaborately set forth in the message which accompany the return of the bill which no constitutional majority appear to have be find for pass into a law the bill which be now before propose in seventh section the total repeal of of the proviso in the|act|of|september and while increase the duty above direct an unconditional distribution of the land proceed be therefore subject a second time in the period of a|few|day to the necessity of either give approval to a measure which in deliberate judgment be in conflict with great public interest or of return to the house in which originate with objection with all anxiety for the passage of a law which would replenish an exhausted treasury and furnish a sound and healthy encouragement to mechanical industry can not consent to do so at the sacrifice of the peace and harmony of the country and the clear conviction of public duty for some of the reason which have bring to this conclusion refer to previous message to congress and briefly subjoin the following the bill unite subject which so far from have any affinity to one another be wholly incongruous in character be both a revenue and an appropriation bill thus impose on the executive in the first place the necessity of either approve that which would reject or reject that which may otherwise approve this be a species of constraint to which the judgment of the executive ought not in opinion to be subject but that be not only objection to the act in present form the union of subject wholly dissimilar in character in the same bill if grow into a practice would not fail to lead to consequence destructive of all wise and conscientious legislation various measure each agreeable only to a small minority may by be thus unite and the more the great chance of success lead to the passing of law of which no single provision could if stand alone command a majority in favor while the treasury be in a state of extreme embarrassment require every dollar which can make available and when the government have not only to lay additional taxis but to borrow money to meet pressing demand the bill propose to give away a fruitful source of revenue which be the same thing as raise money by loan and taxation not to meet the want of the government but for distribution a proceeding which must regard as highly impolitic if not unconstitutional a brief review of the present condition of the public finance will serve to illustrate the true condition of the treasury and exhibit actual necessity on the 5th of august friday last there be in the treasury in round numbers------------------------------------------------------ necessary to be retain to meet trust fund interest on public debt due in to redeem treasury note and pay the interest-------------------------------------- land distribution under the act of the 4th

the 4th of september last of which nearly a moiety go to a few states and only|about|$383,000 be to be divide among all the states while add materially to the embarrassment of the treasury afford to the states no decided relief no immediate relief from this state of thing be anticipate unless what would most deeply be deplore the government could be reconcile to the negotiation of loan already authorize by law at a rate of discount ruinous in and calculate most seriously to affect the public credit so great be the depression of trade that even if the present bill be to become a law and prove to be productive some time would elapse before sufficient supply would flow into the treasury while in the meantime embarrassment would be continually augment by the semiannual distribution of the land proceed indeed there be but too much ground to apprehend that even if this bill be permit to become a law alienate as do the proceed of the land sale an actual deficit in the treasury would occur which would more than probably involve the necessity of a resort to direct taxation let be also remark that of the public debt become redeemable in which at any sacrifice must be meet while the treasury be always liable to demand for the payment of outstanding treasury note such be the gloomy picture which financial department now present and which call for the exercise of a rigid economy in the public expenditure and the render available of all the mean within the control of the government most respectfully submit whether this be a time to give away the proceed of the land sale when the public land constitute a fund which of all other may be make most useful in sustain the public credit can the government be generous and munificent to other when every dollar can command be necessary to supply own want and if congress would not hesitate to suffer the provision of the act of 4th september last to remain unrepealed in case the country be involve in war be not the necessity for such a course now just as imperative as would be then a third objection remain to be urge which would be sufficient in to induce to return the bill to the house with objection by unite subject so incongruous as tariff and distribution inevitably make the fate of the dependent upon that of the other in future contest of party can anything be more fatal to the merchant or manufacturer than such an alliance what most of all require be a system of moderate duty so arrange as to withdraw the tariff question as far as possible completely from the arena of political contention chief want be permanency and stability such an increase of the tariff believe to be necessary in order to meet the economical expenditure of government such an increase make in the spirit of moderation and judicious discrimination would have no doubt be entirely satisfactory to the great majority of the american people in the way of accomplish a measure so salutary and so imperatively demand by every public interest the legislative department will meet with a cordial cooperation on the part of the executive this be all that the manufacturer can desire and would be a burden readily bear by the people but can not too earnestly repeat that in order to be beneficial must be permanent and in order to be permanent must command general acquiescence but can such permanency be justly hope for if the tariff question be couple with that of distribution as to which a serious conflict of opinion exist among the states and the people and which enlist in support a bare majority if indeed there be a majority of the houses|of|congress what permanency or stability can attach to a measure which war upon give away a fruitful source of revenue at the moment propose a large increase of taxis on the people be the manufacturer prepare to stake and interest upon such an issue know that be urge but most erroneously in opinion that instability be just as apt to be produce by retain the public land as a source of revenue as from any other cause and this be ascribe to a constant fluctuation as be say in the amount of sale if there be anything in this objection equally apply to every imposition of duty on import the amount of revenue annually derive from duty be constantly liable to change the regulation of foreign government the vary productiveness of other country period of excitement in trade and a great variety of other circumstance be constantly arise to affect the state of commerce foreign and domestic and of consequence the revenue levy upon the sale of the public domain in ordinary time be regulate by fix law which have basis in a demand increase only in the ratio of the increase of population in recur to the statistic connect with this subject will be perceive that for a period of ten|years|preceding|1834 the average amount of land sale do not exceed for the increase which take place in and be to look to that peculiar condition of the country which grow out of of the most extraordinary excitement in business and speculation that have ever occur in the history of commerce and currency be the fruit of a wild spirit of adventure engender by a vicious system of credit under the evil of which the country be still labor and which be fondly hope will not soon recur consider the vast amount of investment make by private individual in the public land during those three|year and which equal equal to more|than|twenty|year ' purchase take the average of sale of the|ten|preceding|year may be safely assert that the result of the public land sale can hold out nothing to alarm the manufacturer with the idea of instability in the revenue and consequently in the course of the government under what appear to therefore the sound consideration of public policy and in view of the interest of every branch of domestic industry return the bill with these objection to become a law take occasion emphatically to repeat anxious desire to cooperate with congress in the passing of a law which while shall assist in supply the want of the treasury and reestablish public credit shall afford to the manufacture interest of the country all the incidental protection require after all the effect of what do be substantially to call on congress to reconsider the subject if on such reconsideration a majority of third of both houses should be in favor of this measure will become a law notwithstanding objection in a case of clear and manifest error on the part of the president the presumption of the constitution be that such majority will be find should be so find in this case have conscientiously discharge own duty shall cheerfully acquiesce in the result transcript to the senate and house|of|representatif the season for active hostility in florida have nearly terminate attention have necessarily be direct to the course of measure to be pursue hereafter in relation to the few indians yet remain in that territory number be believe not to exceed of whom there be suppose to be about|80 warrior or male capable of bear arm the further pursuit of these miserable being by a large military force seem to be as injudicious as be unavaile the history of the|last|year 's campaign in florida have satisfactorily show that notwithstanding the vigorous and incessant operation of troop which can not be exceed the indian mode of warfare disperse condition and the very smallness of number which increase the difficulty of find in the abundant and almost inaccessible hiding place of the territory render any further attempt to secure by force impracticable except by the employment of the most expensive mean the exhibition of force and the constant effort to capture or destroy of course place beyond the reach of overture to surrender be believe by the distinguished officer in command there that a different system should now be pursue to attain the entire removal of all the indians in florida and recommend that hostility should cease unless the renewal of be render necessary by new aggression that communication should be open by mean of the indians with to insure a peaceful and voluntary surrender and that the military operation should hereafter be direct to the protection of the inhabitant these view be strengthen and corroborate by the governor of the territory by many of most intelligent citizen and by numerous officer of the army who have serve and be still serve in that region mature reflection have satisfy that these recommendation be sound and just and rejoice that consistently with duty to florida may indulge desire to promote the great interest of humanity and extend the reign of peace and good will by terminate the unhappy warfare that have so long be carry on there and at the same time gratify anxiety to reduce the demand upon the treasury by curtail the extraordinary expense which have attend the contest have therefore authorize the colonel in command there as soon as shall deem expedient to declare that hostility against the indians have cease and that will not be renew unless provoke and render indispensable by new outrage on part but that neither citizen nor troop be to be restrain from any

effectual be essential that settlement of citizen should be make within the line so establish and that should be armed so as to be ready to repel any attack in order to afford inducement to such settlement submit to the consideration of congress the propriety of allow a reasonable quantity of land to the head of each family that shall permanently occupy and of extend the exist provision on that subject so as to permit the issue of ration for the subsistence of the settler for one|year and as few of will probably be provide with arm would be expedient to authorize the loan of musket and

of the treasury be incompatible not only with a high state of public credit but with anything approach to efficiency in the conduct of public affair must be obvious even to the most inexperienced mind that to say nothing of any particular exigency actual or imminent there should be at all time in the treasury of a great nation with a view to contingency of ordinary occurrence a surplus at least equal in amount to the above deficiency but that deficiency serious as would be in will be compel to say rather be increase than diminish without the adoption of measure adequate to correct the evil at once the stagnation of trade and business in some degree incident to the derangement of the national finance and the state of the revenue law hold out but little prospect of relief in the ordinary course of thing for some time to come under such circumstance be deeply impressed with the necessity of meet the crisis with a vigor and decision which imperatively demand at the hand of all intrust with the conduct of public affair the gravity of the evil call for a remedy proportion to no slight palliative or occasional expedient will give the country the relief need such measure on the contrary will in the end as be now manifest to all too surely multiply embarrassment rely as be bind to do on the representative of a people render illustrious among nation by have pay off whole public debt shall not shrink from the responsibility impose upon by the constitution of point out such measure as will in opinion insure adequate relief be the more encouraged to recommend the course which necessity exact by the confidence which have in complete success the resource of the country in everything that constitute the wealth and strength of nation be so abundant the spirit of a most industrious enterprising and intelligent people be so energetic and elastic that the government will be without the shadow of excuse for delinquency if the difficulty which now embarrass be not speedily and effectually remove from present indication be hardly doubtful that congress will find necessary to lay additional duty on import in order to meet the ordinary current expense of the government in the exercise of a sound discrimination have reference to revenue but at the same time necessarily afford incidental protection to manufacture industry seem equally probable that duty on some article of importation will have to be advance above in perform this important work of revise the tariff of duty which in the present emergency would seem to be indispensable can not too strongly recommend the cultivation of a spirit of mutual harmony and concession to which the government owe origin and without the continued exercise of which jarring and discord would universally prevail an additional reason for the increase of duty in some instance beyond the rate of will exist in fulfil the recommendation already make and now repeat of make adequate appropriation for the defense of the country by the express provision of the act distribute the proceed of the sale of the public land among the states operation be ipso to cease so soon as the rate of the duty shall exceed the limit prescribe in the act in recommend the adoption of measure for distribute the proceed of the public land among the states at the commencement of the last session of congress such distribution be urge by argument and consideration which appear to then and appear to now of great weight and be place on the condition that should not render necessary any departure from the act of be with sincere regret that now perceive the necessity of depart from that act because be well aware that expectation justly entertain by some of the states will be disappoint by any occasion which shall withhold from the proceed of the land but the condition be plainly express in the message and be insert in term equally plain in the law and amidst the embarrassment which surround the country on all side and beset both the general and the state governments appear to that the object first and high in importance be to establish the credit of this government and to place on durable foundation and thus afford the most effectual support to the credit of the states equal at least to what would receive from a direct distribution of the proceed of the sale of the public land when the distribution law be pass there be reason to anticipate that there soon would be a real surplus to distribute on that assumption be in opinion a wise a just and a beneficent measure but to continue in force while there be no such surplus to distribute and when be manifestly necessary not only to increase the duty but at the same time to borrow money in order to liquidate the public debt and disembarrass the public treasury would cause to be regard as an unwise alienation of the good security of the public creditor which would with difficulty be excuse and could not be justify cause of no ordinary character have recently depress american credit in the stock market of the world to a degree quite unprecedented need scarcely mention the condition of the banking institution of some of the states the vast amount of foreign debt contract during a period of wild speculation by corporation and individual and above all the doctrine of repudiation of contract solemnly enter into by states which although as yet apply only under circumstance of a peculiar character and generally rebuke with severity by the moral sense of the community be yet so very licentious and in a government depend wholly on opinion so very alarming that the impression make by to disadvantage as a people be anything but surprising under such circumstance be imperatively due from to the people whom represent that when go into the money market to contract a loan should tender such security as to cause the money lender as well at home as abroad to feel that the most propitious opportunity be afford of invest profitably and judiciously capital a government which have pay off the debt of war wag with the most powerful nation of modern time should not be bring to the necessity of chaffer for term in the money market under such circumstance as have advert to object should be to produce with the capitalist a feeling of entire confidence by a tender of that sort of security which in all time past have be esteem sufficient and which for the small amount of propose indebtedness will unhesitatingly be regard as amply adequate while a pledge of all the revenue amount to no more than be imply in every instance when the government contract a debt and although ought in ordinary circumstance to be entirely satisfactory yet in time like these the capitalist would feel better satisfied with the pledge of a specific fund ample in magnitude to the payment of interest and ultimate reimbursement of principal such be the character of the land fund the most vigilant money dealer will readily perceive that not only will interest be secure on such a pledge but that a debt of or would by the surplus of sale over and above the payment of the interest be extinguish within any reasonable time fix for redemption to relieve the treasury from embarrassment and to aid in meet requisition until time be allow for any new tariff of duty to become available would seem to be necessary to fund a debt approach to and in order to place the negotiation of the loan beyond a reasonable doubt submit to congress whether the proceed of the sale of the public land should not be pledge for the payment of the interest and the secretary of the treasury be authorize out of the surplus of the proceed of such sale to purchase the stock when can be procure on such term as will render beneficial in that way to extinguish the debt and prevent the accumulation of such surplus while distribution be suspend no one can doubt that be the|federal|treasury now as prosperous as be ten|years|ago and fiscal operation conduct by an efficient agency of own coextensive with the union the embarrassment of the states and corporation in would produce even if continue as be be that possible effect far less disastrous than those now experienced be the disorder here at the heart and center of the system that paralyze and derange every part of who do not know the permanent importance not to the|federal|government alone but to every state and every individual within jurisdiction even in most independent and isolate individual pursuit of the preservation of a sound state of public opinion and a judicious administration here the sympathy be instantaneous and universal to attempt to remedy the evil of the derange credit and currency of the states while the disease be allow to rage in the vital of this government would be a hopeless undertaking be the full conviction of this truth which embolden most earnestly to recommend to early and serious consideration the measure now submit to well judgment as well as those to which attention have be already invite the first great want of the country that without answer which all attempt at better the present condition of thing will prove fruitless be a complete restoration of the credit and finance of the|federal|government the source and foundation of all credit be in the confidence which the government inspire and just in proportion as that confidence shall be shake or diminish will be the distrust among all class of the community and the derangement and demoralization in every branch of business and all the interest of the country keep up the standard of good faith and punctuality in the operation of the|general|government and all partial irregularity and disorder will be rectify by the influence of example but suffer that standard to be debase or disturb and be impossible to foresee to what a degree of degradation and confusion all financial interest public and private may sink in such a country as this the representative of the people have only to will and the public credit will be as high as ever be own view of the measure calculate to effect this great and desirable object have thus frankly express to congress under circumstance which give to the entire subject a peculiar and solemn interest the executive can do no more if the credit of the country be expose to question if the public defense be break down or weaken if the whole administration of public affair be embarrass for want of the necessary mean for conduct with vigor and effect trust that this department of the government will be find to have do all that be in power to avert such evil and will be acquit of all just blame on account of transcript to the senate and house|of|representatif of the|united|state in come together fellow citizen to enter again upon the discharge of the duty with which the people have charge severally find great occasion to rejoice in the general prosperity of the country be in the enjoyment of all the blessing of civil and religious liberty with unexampled mean of education knowledge and improvement through the|year which be now draw to a close peace have be in border and plenty in habitation and although disease have visit some few portion of the land with distress and mortality yet in general the health of the people have be preserve and be all call upon by the high obligation of duty to renew thank and devotion to heavenly parent who have continue to vouchsafe to the eminent blessing which surround and who have so signally crown the|year with goodness if find increase beyond example in number in strength in wealth in knowledge in everything which promote human and social happiness let ever remember dependence for all these on the protection and merciful dispensation of divine|providence since last adjournment alexander|mcleod a british subject who be indict for the murder of an american citizen and whose case have be the subject of a correspondence heretofore communicate to have be acquit by the verdict of an impartial and intelligent jury and have under the judgment of the court be regularly discharge great|britain have make known to this government that the expedition which be fit out from canada for the destruction of the steamboat caroline in the|winter|of|1837 and which result in the destruction of say boat and in the death of an american citizen be undertake by order emanate from the authority of the|british|government in canada and demand the discharge of mcleod upon the ground that if engage in that expedition do but fulfill the order of government have thus be answer in the only way in which could be answer by a government the power of which be distribute among several department by the fundamental law happily for the people of great|britain as well as those of the|united|state the only mode by which an individual arraign for a criminal offense before the court of either can obtain discharge be by the independent action of the judiciary and by proceeding equally familiar to the court of both country if in great|britain a power exist in the crown to cause to be enter a nolle prosequi which be not the case with the executive power of the|united|state upon a prosecution pende in a state court yet there no more than here can the chief executive power rescue a prisoner from custody without an order of the proper tribunal direct discharge the precise stage of the proceeding at which such order may be make be a matter of municipal regulation exclusively and not to be complain of by any other government in case of this kind a government become politically responsible only when tribunal of last resort be show to have render unjust and injurious judgment in matter not doubtful to the establishment and elucidation of this principle no nation have lend authority more efficiently than great|britain alexander|mcleod have option either to prosecute a writ of error from the decision of the supreme court of new|york which have be render upon application for a discharge to the|supreme|court of the|united|state or to submit case to the decision of a jury prefer the latter deem the ready mode of obtain liberation and the result have fully sustain the wisdom of choice the manner in which the issue submit be try will satisfy the|english|government that the principle of justice will never fail to govern the enlightened decision of an american tribunal can not fail however to suggest to congress the propriety and in some degree the necessity of make such provision by law so far as may constitutionally do so for the removal at commencement and at the option of the party of all such case as may hereafter arise and which may involve the faithful observance and execution of international obligation from the state to the federal judiciary this government by institution be charge with the maintenance of peace and the preservation of amicable relation with the nation of the earth and ought to possess without question all the reasonable and proper mean of maintain the and preserve the other while just confidence be feel in the judiciary of the states yet this government ought to be competent in for the fulfillment of the high duty which have be devolve upon under the organic law by the states in the|month|of|september a party of armed man from invade the territory of the|united|state and forcibly seize upon the person of grogan and under circumstance of great harshness hurriedly carry beyond the limit of the|united|state and deliver np to the authority of immediate discharge be order by those authority upon the fact of the case be bring to knowledge a course of procedure which be to have be expect from a nation with whom be at peace and which be not more due to the right of the united state than to own regard for justice the correspondence which pass between the|department|of|state and the british envoy mr. fox and with the governor of vermont as soon as the fact have be make known to this department be herewith communicate regret that be not in power to make known to an equally satisfactory conclusion in the case of the caroline steamer with the circumstance connect with the destruction of which in december,|1837 by an armed force fit out in the|province|of|upper|canada be already make acquaint no such atonement as be due for the public wrong do to the|united|state by this invasion of territory so wholly irreconcilable with right as an independent power have yet be make in the view take by this government the inquiry whether the vessel be in the employment of those who be prosecute an unauthorized war against that province or be engage by the owner in the business of transport passenger to and from navy|island in hope of private gain which be most probably the case in no degree alter the real question at issue between the government this government can never concede to any foreign government the power except in a case of the most urgent and extreme necessity of invade territory either to arrest the person or destroy the property of those who may have violate the municipal law of such foreign government or have disregard obligation arise under the law of nation the territory of the|united|state must be regard as sacredly secure against all such invasion until shall voluntarily acknowledge inability to acquit of duty to other and in announce this sentiment do but affirm a principle which no nation on earth would be more ready to vindicate at all hazard than the people and government of great britain if upon a full investigation of all the fact shall appear that the owner of the caroline be govern by a hostile intent or have make common cause with those who be in the occupancy of navy|island then so far as be concern there can be no claim to indemnity for the destruction of boat which this government would feel bind to prosecute since would have act not only in derogation of the right of great|britain but in clear violation of the law of the|united|state but that be a question which however settle in no manner involve the high consideration of the violation of territorial sovereignty and jurisdiction to recognize as an admissible practice that each government in turn upon any sudden and unauthorized outbreak which on a frontier the extent of which render impossible for either to have an efficient force on every mile of and which outbreak therefore neither may be able to suppress in a|day may take vengeance into own hand and without even a remonstrance and in the absence of any press or overrule necessity may invade the territory of the other would inevitably lead to result equally to be deplore by both when border collision come to receive the sanction or to be make on the authority of either government general war must be the inevitable result while be the ardent desire of the|united|state to cultivate the relation of peace with all nation and to fulfill all the duty of good neighborhood toward those who possess territory adjoin own that very desire would lead to deny the right of any foreign power to invade boundary with an armed force the correspondence between the government on this subject will at a|future|day of session be submit to consideration and in the meantime can not but indulge the hope that the|british|government will see the propriety of renouncing as a rule of future action the precedent which have be set in the affair at schlosser herewith submit the correspondence which have recently take place between the american minister at the|court|of|st.|james mr. stevenson and the minister of foreign affair of that government on the right claim by that government to visit and detain vessel sail under the american flag and engage in prosecute lawful commerce in the african sea commercial interest in that region have experience considerable increase and have become an object of much importance and be the duty of this government to protect against all improper and vexatious interruption however desirous the|united|state may be for the suppression of the slave trade can not consent to interpolation into the maritime code at the mere will and pleasure of other government deny the right of any such interpolation to any one or all the nation of the earth without consent claim to have a voice in all amendment or alteration of that code and when be give to understand as in this instance by a foreign government that treaty with other nation can not be execute without the establishment and enforcement of new principle of maritime police to be apply without consent must employ a language neither of equivocal import or susceptible of misconstruction american citizen prosecute a lawful commerce in the african sea under the flag of country be not responsible for the abuse or unlawful use of that flag by other nor can rightfully on account of any such alleged abuse be interrupt molest or detain while on the ocean and if thus molest and detain while pursue honest voyage in the usual way and violate no law be unquestionably entitle to indemnity this government have manifest repugnance to the slave trade in a manner which can not be misunderstood by fundamental law prescribe limit in point of time to continuance and against own citizen who may so far forget the right of humanity as to engage in that wicked traffic have long since by municipal law denounce the most condign punishment many of the states compose this union have make appeal to the civilized world for suppression long before the moral sense of other nation have become shock by the iniquity of the traffic whether this government should now enter into treaty contain mutual stipulation upon this subject be a question for mature deliberation certain be that if the right to detain american ship on the high sea can be justify on the plea of a necessity for such detention arise out of the existence of treaty between other nation the same plea may be extend and enlarge by the new stipulation of new treaty to which the|united|state may not be a party this government will not cease to urge upon that of great|britain full and ample remuneration for all loss whether arise from detention or otherwise to which american citizen have heretofore be or may hereafter be subject by the exercise of right which this government can not recognize as legitimate and proper nor will indulge a doubt but that the sense of justice of great|britain will constrain to make retribution for any wrong or loss which any american citizen engage in the prosecution of lawful commerce may have experience at the hand of cruiser or other public authority this government at the same time will relax no effort to prevent citizen if there be any so disposed from prosecute a traffic so revolt to the feeling of humanity seek to do no more than to protect the fair and honest trader from molestation and injury but while the enterprising mariner engage in the pursuit of an honorable trade be entitle to protection will visit with condign punishment other of an opposite character invite attention to exist law for the suppression of the african slave trade and recommend all such alteration as may give to great force and efficacy that the american flag be grossly abuse by the abandon and profligate of other nation be but too probable congress have not long since have this subject under consideration and importance well justifie renew and anxious attention also communicate herewith the copy of a correspondence between mr. stevenson and lord palmerston upon the subject so interesting to several of the|southern|state of the rice duty which result honorably to the justice of great|britain and advantageously to the|united|state at the opening of the last annual session the president inform congress of the progress which have then be make in negotiate a convention between this government and that of england with a view to the final settlement of the question of the boundary between the territorial limit of the country regret to say that little further advancement of the object have be accomplish since last|year but this be owe to circumstance no way indicative of any abatement of the desire of both party to hasten the negotiation to conclusion and to settle the question in dispute as early as possible in the course of the session be hope to be able to announce some further degree of progress toward the accomplishment of this highly desirable end the commission appoint by this government for the exploration and survey of the line of boundary separate the|states|of|maine and new|hampshire from the conterminous british|province be be believe about to close field labor and be expect soon to report the result of examination to the report when receive will be lay before congress the failure on the part of spain to pay with punctuality the interest due under the convention of for the settlement of claim between the country have make the duty of the executive to call the particular attention of that government to the subject a disposition have be manifest by which be believe to be entirely sincere to fulfill obligation in this respect so soon as internal condition and the state of finance will permit an arrangement be in progress from the result of which be trust that those of citizen who have claim under the convention will at no distant day receive the stipulate payment a treaty of commerce and navigation with belgium be conclude and sign at washington on the|29th|of|march,|1840 and be duly sanction by the senate of the|united|state the treaty be ratify by belgian|majesty but do not receive the approbation of the belgian chambers within the time limit by term and have therefore become void this occurrence assume the graver aspect from the consideration that in a treaty negotiate between the government and ratify on the part of the|united|state fail to be ratify on the part of belgium the representative of that government at washington inform the|department|of|state that have be instruct to give explanation of the cause which occasion delay in the approval of the late treaty by the legislature and to express the regret of the king at the occurrence the joint commission under the convention with texas to ascertain the true boundary between the country have conclude labor but the final report of the commissioner of the|united|state have not be receive be understand however that the meridian line as trace by the commission lie somewhat farther east than the position hitherto generally assign to and consequently include in texas some part of the territory which have be consider as belong to the|states|of|louisiana and arkansas the|united|state can not but take a deep interest in whatever relate to this young but grow republic settle principally by emigrant from the|united|state have the happiness to know that the great principle of civil liberty be there destine to flourish under wise institution and wholesome law and that through example another evidence be to be afford of the capacity of popular institution to advance the prosperity happiness and permanent glory of the human race the great truth that government be make for the people and not the people for government have already be establish in the practice and by the example of these|united|states and can do no other than contemplate further exemplification by a sister republic with the deep interest relation with the independent state of this hemisphere formerly under the dominion of spain have not undergo any material change within the|past|year the incessant sanguinary conflict in or between those country be to be greatly deplore as necessarily tend to disable from perform duty as member of the community of nation and rise to the destiny which the position and natural resource of many of may lead justly to anticipate as constantly give occasion also directly or indirectly for complaint on the part of citizen who resort thither for purpose of commercial intercourse and as retard reparation for wrong already commit some of which be by no mean of recent date the failure of the congress of ecuador to hold a session at the time appoint for that purpose in january last will probably render abortive a treaty of commerce with that republic which be sign at quito on the|13th|of|june,|1839 and have be duly ratified on part but which require the approbation of that body prior to ratification by a convention which have be conclude with the|republic|of|peru provide for the settlement of certain claim of citizen of the|united|state upon the government of that republic will be duly submit to the senate the claim of citizen against the|brazilian|government originate from capture and other cause be still unsatisfied the|united|state have however so uniformly show a disposition to cultivate relation of amity with that empire that be hope the unequivocal token of the same spirit toward which an adjustment of the affair refer to would afford will be give without further avoidable delay the war with the indian tribe on the peninsula of florida have during the|last|summer and fall be prosecute with untiring activity and zeal a summer campaign be resolve upon as the good mode of bring to a close brave officer and man who have be engage in that service have suffer toil and privation and exhibit an energy which in any other war would have win for unfade laurel in despite of the sickness incident to the climate have penetrate the fastness of the indians break up encampment and harass unceasingly number have be capture and still great number have surrender and have be transport to join brother on the land elsewhere allot to by the government and a strong hope be entertain that under the conduct of the gallant officer at the head of the troop in florida that troublesome and expensive war be destine to a speedy termination with all the other indian tribe be enjoy the blessing of peace duty as well as good interest prompt to observe in all intercourse with fidelity in fulfil engagement the practice of strict justice as well as the constant exercise of act of benevolence and kindness these be the great instrument of civilization and through the use of alone can the untutored child of the forest be induce to listen to teaching the secretary of state on whom the act of congress have devolve the duty of direct the proceeding for the taking of the sixth census or enumeration of the inhabitant of the|united|state will report to the houses the progress of that work the enumeration of person have be complete and exhibit a grand total of make an increase over the census of of inhabitant and show a gain in a ratio exceed per cent for the|last|ten|year from the report of the secretary of the treasury will be inform of the condition of the finance the balance in the treasury on the|1st|of|january|last as state in the report of the secretary of the treasury submit to congress at the extra session be the receipt into the treasury during the|first|three|quarters|of|this|year from all source amount to the estimate receipt for the|fourth|quarter amount to amount to and make with the balance in the treasury on the|1st|of|january last the expenditure for the|first|three|quarters|of|this|year amount to the expenditure for the|fourth|quarter as estimate will amount to thus make a total of and leave a deficit to be provide for on the|1st|of|january next of of the loan of which be authorize by congress at late session have be negotiate the shortness of time which have to run have present no inconsiderable impediment in the way of being take by capitalist at home while the same cause would have operate with much great force in the foreign market for that reason the foreign market have not be resort to and be now submit whether would not be advisable to amend the law by make what remain undisposed of payable at a|more|distant|day should be necessary in any view that congress may take of the subject to revise the exist tariff of duty beg leave to say that in the performance of that most delicate operation moderate counsel would seem to be the wise the government under which be happiness to live owe existence to the spirit of compromise which prevail among framer jar and discordant opinion could only have be reconcile by that noble spirit of patriotism which prompt conciliation and result in harmony in the same spirit the compromise bill as be commonly call be adopt at the session of while the people of no portion of the union will ever hesitate to pay all necessary taxis for the support of government yet an innate repugnance exist to the imposition of burthen not really necessary for that object in impose duty however for the purpose of revenue a right to discriminate as to the article on which the duty shall be lay as well as the amount necessarily and most properly exist otherwise the government would be place in the condition of have to levy the same duty upon all article the productive as well as the unproductive the slight duty upon some may have the effect of cause importation to cease whereas other enter extensively into the consumption of the country may bear the heavy without any sensible diminution in the amount import so also the government may be justify in so discriminate by reference to other consideration of domestic policy connect with manufacture so long as the duty shall be lay with distinct reference to the want of the treasury no well round objection can exist against may be esteem desirable that no such augmentation of the taxis should take place as would have the effect of annul the land proceed distribution act of the last session which act be declare to be inoperative the moment the duty be increase beyond the maximum rate establish by the compromise act some of the provision of the compromise act which will go into effect on the|30th|day|of|june|next may however be find exceedingly inconvenient in practice under any regulation that congress may adopt refer more particularly to that relate to the home valuation a difference in value of the same article to some extent will necessarily exist at different port but that be altogether insignificant when compare with the conflict in valuation which be likely to arise from the difference of opinion among the numerous appraiser of merchandise in many instance the estimate of value must be conjectural and thus as many different rate of value may be establish as there be appraiser these difference in valuation may also be increase by the inclination which without the slight imputation on honesty may arise on the part of the appraiser in favor of respective port of entry recommend this whole subject to the consideration of congress with a single additional remark certainty and permanency in any system of governmental policy be in all respect eminently desirable but more particularly be this true in all that affect trade and commerce the operation of which depend much more on the certainty of return and calculation which embrace distant period of time than on high bounty or duty which be liable to constant fluctuation at late session invite attention to the condition of the currency and exchange and urge the necessity of adopt such measure as be consistent with the constitutional competency of the government in order to correct the unsoundness of the one and as far as practicable the inequality of the other no country can be in the enjoyment of full measure of prosperity without the presence of a medium of exchange approximate to uniformity of value what be necessary as between the different nation of the earth be also important as between the inhabitant of different part of the same country with the first the precious metal constitute the chief medium of circulation and such also would be the case as to the last but for invention comparatively modern which have furnish in place of gold and silver a paper circulation do not propose to enter into a comparative analysis of the merit of the system such belong more properly to the period of the introduction of the paper system the speculative philosopher may find inducement to prosecute the inquiry but research could only lead to conclude that the paper system have probably better never have be introduce and that society may have be much happy without the practical statesman have a very different task to perform have to look at thing as be to take as find to supply deficiency and to prune excess as far as in lie the task of furnish a corrective for derangement of the paper medium with be almost inexpressibly great the power exert by the states to charter banking corporation and which have be carry to a great excess have fill the country with in most of the states an irredeemable paper medium be an evil which in some way or other require a corrective the rate at which bill of exchange be negotiate between different part of the country furnish an index of the value of the local substitute for gold and silver which be in many part so far depreciate as not to be receive except at a large discount in payment of debt or in the purchase of produce could earnestly be desire that every bank not possess the mean of resumption should follow the example of the late united|states|bank|of|pennsylvania and go into liquidation rather than by refuse to do so to continue embarrassment in the way of solvent institution thereby augment the difficulty incident to the present condition of thing whether this government with due regard to the right of the states have any power to constrain the bank either to resume specie payment or to force into liquidation be an inquiry which will not fail to claim consideration in view of the great advantage which be allow the corporator not among the least of which be the authority contain in most of charter to make loan to time the amount of capital thereby often derive time as much interest on the same amount of money as any individual be permit by law to receive no sufficient apology can be urge for a long continued suspension of specie payment such suspension be productive of the great detriment to the public by expel from circulation the precious metal and seriously hazard the success of any effort that this government can make to increase commercial facility and to advance the public interest this be the more to be regret and the indispensable necessity for a sound currency become the more manifest when reflect on the vast amount of the internal commerce of the country of this have no statistic nor just datum for form adequate opinion but there can be no doubt but that the amount of transportation coastwise by sea and the transportation inland by railroad and canal and by steamboat and other mode of conveyance over the surface of vast river and immense lake and the value of property carry and interchange by these mean form a general aggregate to which the foreign commerce of the country large as be make but a distant approach in the absence of any control power over this subject which by force a general resumption of specie payment would at once have the effect of restore a sound medium of exchange and would leave to the country but little to desire what measure of relief fall within the limit of constitutional competency do become this government to adopt be painful duty at last session under the weight of most solemn obligation to differ with congress on the measure which propose for approval and which doubtless regard as corrective of exist evil subsequent reflection and event since occur have only serve to confirm in the opinion then entertain and frankly express must be permit to add that no scheme of governmental policy unaide by individual exertion can be available for ameliorate the present condition of thing commercial mode of exchange and a good currency be but the necessary mean of commerce and intercourse not the direct productive source of wealth wealth can only be accumulate by the earning of industry and the saving of frugality and nothing can be more ill judge than to look to facility in borrowing or to a redundant circulation for the power of discharge pecuniary obligation the country be full of resource and the people fall of energy and the great and permanent remedy for present embarrassment must be seek in industry economy the observance of good faith and the favorable influence of time in pursuance of a pledge give to in last message to congress which pledge urge as an apology for adventure to present the detail of any plan the secretary of the treasury will be ready to submit to should require a plan of finance which while throw around the public treasure reasonable guard for protection and rest on power acknowledge in practice to exist from the origin of the government will at the same time furnish to the country a sound paper medium and afford all reasonable facility for regulate the exchange when submit will perceive in a plan amendatory of the exist law in relation to the|treasury|department subordinate in all respect to the will of congress directly and the will of the people indirectly self sustain should be find in practice to realize promise in theory and repealable at the pleasure of congress propose by effectual restraint and by invoke the true spirit of institution to separate the purse from the sword or more properly to speak deny any other control to the president over the agent who may be select to carry into execution but what may be indispensably necessary to secure the fidelity of such agent and by wise regulation keep plainly apart from each other private and public fund contemplate the establishment of a board of control at the seat of government with agency at prominent commercial point or wherever else congress shall direct for the safe keeping and disbursement of the public money and a substitution at the option of the public creditor of treasury note in lieu of gold and silver propose to limit the issue to an amount not to exceed without the express sanction of the legislative power also authorize the receipt of individual deposit of gold and silver to a limited amount and the grant certificate of deposit divide into such sum as may be call for by the depositor proceed a step further and authorize the purchase and sale of domestic bill and draft rest on a real and substantial basis payable at sight or have but a short time to run and draw on place not apart which authority except in so far as may be necessary for government purpose exclusively be only to be exert upon the express condition that exercise shall not be prohibit by the state in which the agency be situate in order to cover the expense incident to the plan will be authorize to receive moderate premium for certificate issue on deposit and on bill buy and sell and thus as far as dealing extend to furnish facility to commercial intercourse at the low possible rate and to subduct from the earning of industry the least possible sum use the state bank at a distance from the agency as auxiliary without impart any power to trade in name be subject to such guard and restraint as have appear to be necessary be the creature of law and exist only at the pleasure of the legislature be make to rest on an actual specie basis in order to redeem the note at the place of issue produce no dangerous redundancy of circulation afford no temptation to speculation be attend by no inflation of price be equable in operation make the treasury note which may use along with the certificate of deposit and the note of specie pay bank convertible at the place where collect receivable in payment of government due and without violate any principle of the|constitution|affords|the|government and the people such facility as be call for by the want of both such have appear to be recommendation and in view of will be submit whenever may require to consideration be not able to perceive that any fair and candid objection can be urge against the plan the principal outline of which have thus present can not doubt but that the note which propose to furnish at the voluntary option of the public creditor issue in lieu of the revenue and certificate of deposit will be maintain at an equality with gold and silver everywhere be redeemable in gold and silver on demand at the place of issue be receivable everywhere in payment of government due the treasury note be limit to an amount of fourth less than the estimate annual receipt of the treasury and in addition rest upon the faith of the government for redemption if all these assurance be not sufficient to make available then the idea as seem to of furnish a sound paper medium of exchange may be entirely abandon if a fear be indulge that the government may be tempt to run into excess in issue at any|future|day seem to that no such apprehension can reasonably be entertain until all confidence in the representative of the states and of the people as well as of the people shall be lose the weighty consideration of policy require that the restraint now propose to be throw around the measure should not for light cause be remove to argue against any propose plan liability to possible abuse be to reject every expedient since everything dependent on human action be liable to abuse fifteen|million of treasury note may be issue as the maximum but a discretionary power be to be give to the board of control under that sum and every consideration will unite in lead to feel way with caution for of the existence of the late bank|of|the|united|stat circulation barely exceed and for of most prosperous year be about equal to furthermore the authority give to receive private deposit to a limited amount and to issue certificate in such sum as may be call for by the depositor may so far fill up the channel of circulation as greatly to diminish the necessity of any considerable issue of treasury note a restraint upon the amount of private deposit have seem to be indispensably necessary from an apprehension think to be well found that in any emergency of trade confidence may be so far shake in the bank as to induce a withdrawal from of private deposit with a view to insure unquestionable safety when deposit with the government which may prove eminently disastrous to the state bank be object that be propose to authorize the agency to deal in bill of exchange be answer that such dealing be to be carry on at the low possible premium be make to rest on an unquestionably sound basis be design to reimburse merely the expense which would otherwise devolve upon the treasury and be in strict subordination to the decision of the|supreme|court in the case of and other report case and thereby avoid all conflict with state jurisdiction which hold to be indispensably requisite leave the banking privilege of the states without interference look to the treasury and the union and while furnish every facility to the first be careful of the interest of the last but above all be create by law be amendable by law and be repealable by law and wed as be to no theory but look solely to the advancement of the public good shall be among the very first to urge repeal if be find not to subserve the purpose and object for which may be create nor will the plan be submit in any overweene confidence in the sufficiency of own judgment but with much great reliance on the wisdom and patriotism of congress can not abandon this subject without urge upon in the most emphatic manner whatever may be action on the suggestion which have feel to be duty to submit to relieve the chief executive magistrate by any and all constitutional mean from a control power over the public treasury if in the plan propose should deem worthy of consideration that separation be not as complete as may desire will doubtless amend in that particular for disclaim all desire to have any control over the public money other than what be indispensably necessary to execute the law which may pass nor can fail to advert in this connection to the debt which many of of the union have contract abroad and under which continue to labor that indebtedness amount to a sum not less than and which have be retribute to for the most part in work of internal improvement which be destine to prove of vast importance in ultimately advance prosperity and wealth for the debt thus contract the states be alone responsible can do not more than express the belief that each state will feel bind by every consideration of honor as well as of interest to meet engagement with punctuality the failure however of any state to do so should in no degree affect the credit of the rest and the foreign capitalist will have no just cause to experience alarm as to all other state stock because any or more of the states may neglect to provide with punctuality the mean of redeem engagement even such states should there be any consider the great rapidity with which resource be develop will not fail to have the mean at no very distant day to redeem obligation to the uttermost farthing nor will doubt but that in view of that honorable conduct which have evermore govern the states and the people of the union will each and all resort to every legitimate expedient before will forego a faithful compliance with obligation from the report of the secretary of war and other report accompany will be inform of the progress which have be make in the fortification design for the protection of principal city roadstead and inland frontier during the|present|year together with true state and condition will be prosecute to completion with all the expedition which the mean place by congress at the disposal of the executive will allow recommend particularly to consideration that portion of the secretary 's report which propose the establishment of a chain of military post from council|bluff to some point on the|pacific|ocean within limit the benefit thereby destine to accrue to citizen engage in the fur trade over that wilderness region add to the importance of cultivate friendly relation with savage tribe inhabit and at the same time of give protection to frontier settlement and of establish the mean of safe intercourse between the american settlement at the mouth of and those on this side of the|rocky|mountain would seem to suggest the importance of carry into effect the recommendation upon this head with as little delay as may be practicable the report of the secretary of the navy will place in possession of the present condition of that important arm of the national defense every effort will be make to add to efficiency and can not too strongly urge upon liberal appropriation to that branch of the public service inducement of the weighty character exist for the adoption of this course of policy extended and otherwise expose maritime frontier call for protection to the furnishing of which an efficient naval force be indispensable look to no foreign conquest nor do propose to enter into competition with any other nation for supremacy on the ocean but be due not only to the honor but to the security of the people of the|united|state that no nation should be permit to invade water at pleasure and subject town and village to conflagration or pillage economy in all branch of the public service be due from all the public agent to the people but parsimony alone would suggest the withholding of the necessary mean for the protection of domestic fireside from invasion and national honor from disgrace would most earnestly recommend to congress to abstain from all appropriation for object not absolutely necessary but take upon without a moment of hesitancy all the responsibility of recommend the increase and prompt equipment of that gallant navy which have light up every sea with victory and spread an imperishable glory over the country the report of the|postmaster general will claim particular attention not only because of the valuable suggestion which contain but because of the great importance which at all time attach to that interesting branch of the public service the increase expense of transport the mail along the principal route necessarily claim the public attention and have awaken a corresponding solicitude on the part of the government the transmission of the mail must keep pace with those facility of intercommunication which be every day become great through the building of railroad and the application of steam power but can not be disguise that in order to do so the|post office|department be subject to heavy exaction the line of communication between distant part of the union be to a great extent occupy by railroad which in the nature of thing possess a complete monopoly and the department be therefore liable to heavy and unreasonable charge this evil be destine to great increase in future and some timely measure may become necessary to guard against feel duty to bring under consideration a practice which have grow up in the administration of the government and which be deeply convinced ought to be correct allude to the exercise of the power which usage rather than reason have vest in the president of remove incumbent from office in order to substitute other more in favor with the dominant party own conduct in this respect have be govern by a conscientious purpose to exercise the remove power only in case of unfaithfulness or inability or in those in which exercise appear necessary in order to discountenance and suppress that spirit of active partisanship on the part of holder of office which not only withdraw from the steady and impartial discharge of official duty but exert an undue and injurious influence over election and degrade the character of the government inasmuch as exhibit the chief magistrate as be a party through agent in the secret plot or open working of political party in respect to the exercise of this power nothing should be leave to discretion which may safely be regulate by law and be of high importance to restrain as far as possible the stimulus of personal interest in public election consider the great increase which have be make in public office in the|last|quarter|of|a|century and the probability of further increase incur the hazard of witness violent political contest direct too often to the single object of retain office by those who be in or obtain by those who be out under the influence of these conviction shall cordially concur in any constitutional measure for regulating and by regulate restrain the power of removal suggest for consideration the propriety of make without further delay some specific application of the fund derive under the will of mr. smithson of england for the diffusion of knowledge and which have heretofore be vest in public stock until such time as congress should think proper to give a specific direction nor will feel confident permit any abatement of the principal of the legacy to be make should turn out that the stock in which the investment have be make have undergo a depreciation in conclusion commend to care the interest of this district for which be the exclusive legislator consider that this city be the residence of the government and for a large part of the|year of congress and consider also the great cost of the public building and the propriety of afford at all time careful protection seem not unreasonable that congress should contribute toward the expense of an efficient police transcript to the|house|of|representatives of the|united|state be with extreme regret that feel constrain by the duty faithfully to execute the office of president of the|united|state and to the good of ability to preserve protect and defend the|united|state to return to the house in which originate the bill to provide for the well collection safe keeping and disbursement of the public revenue by mean of a corporation to be style the|fiscal|corporation|of|the|united|state with write objection in message send to the senate on the|16th|day|of|august last return the bill to incorporate the subscriber to the|fiscal|bank|of the|united|state distinctly declare that own opinion have be uniformly proclaim to be against the exercise of the power of congress to create a national bank to operate per over the union and entertain that opinion main objection to that bill be base upon the high moral and religious obligation of conscience and the constitution readily admit that whilst the qualified veto with which the chief magistrate be invest should be regard and be intend by the wise man who make a part of the constitution as a great conservative principle of system without the exercise of which on important occasion a mere representative majority may urge the government in legislation beyond the limit fix by framer or may exert just power too hastily or oppressively yet be a power which ought to be most cautiously exert and perhaps never except in a case eminently involve the public interest or in which the oath of the president act under conviction both mental and moral imperiously require exercise in such a case have no alternative must either exert the negative power intrust to by the constitution chiefly for own preservation protection and defense or commit an act of gross moral turpitude mere regard to the will of a majority must not in a constitutional republic like ours control this sacred and solemn duty of a swear officer the constitution regard and cherish as the embody and write will of the whole people of the|united|state be fix and fundamental law which unanimously prescribe to the public functionary mere trustee and servant this will and the law which have give as the rule of action have no guard no guaranty of preservation protection and defense but the oath which prescribe to the public officer the sanctity with which shall religiously observe those oath and the patriotism with which the people shall shield by own sovereign will which have make the constitution supreme must be exert against the will of a mere representative majority or not at all be alone in pursuance of that will that any measure can reach the president and to say that because a majority in congress have pass a bill should therefore sanction be to abrogate the power altogether and to render insertion in the constitution a work of absolute supererogation the duty be to guard the fundamental will of the people from in this case admit unintentional change or infraction by a majority in congress and in that light alone do regard the constitutional duty which now most reluctantly discharge be this bill now present for approval or disapproval such a bill as have already declare could not receive sanction be such a bill as call for the exercise of the negative power under the constitution do violate the constitution by create a national bank to operate per over the union title in the first place describe general character be an act to provide for the well collection safe keeping and disbursement of the public revenue by mean of a corporation to be style the|fiscal|corporation|of|the|united|state in style then be plainly national in character power function and duty be those which pertain to the collecting keep and disburse the public revenue the mean by which these be to be exert be a corporation to be style the|fiscal|corporation|of|the|united|state be a corporation create by in character of a national legislature for the whole union to perform the fiscal purpose meet the fiscal want and exigency supply the fiscal us and exert the fiscal agency of the treasury of the|united|state such be own description of do provision contradict title do not be true that by first section provide that shall be establish in but the amount of capital the manner in which stock be to be subscribe for and hold the person and body corporate and politic by whom stock may be hold the appointment of director and power and duty fundamental article especially that to establish agency in any part of the union the corporate power and business of such agency the prohibition of congress to establish any other corporation with similar power for twenty|years with express reservation in the same clause to modify or create any bank for the|district|of|columbia so that the aggregate capital shall not exceed five|million without enumerate other feature which be equally distinctive and characteristic clearly show that can not be regard as other than a bank of the|united|state with power seemingly more limited than have heretofore be grant to such an institution operate per over the union by virtue of the unaided and in view assume authority of congress as a national legislature as distinguishable from a bank create by congress for the|district|of|columbia as the local legislature of the district every|united|state bank heretofore create have have power to deal in bill of exchange as well as local discount both be trade privilege confer and both be exercise by virtue of the aforesaid power of congress over the whole union the question of power remain unchanged without reference to the extent of privilege grant if this propose corporation be to be regard as a local bank of the|district|of|columbia invest by congress with general power to operate over the union be obnoxious to still strong objection assume that congress may invest a local institution with general or national power with the same propriety that may do this in regard to a bank of the|district|of|columbia may as to a state bank yet who can indulge the idea that this government can rightfully by make a state bank fiscal agent invest with the absolute and unqualified power confer by this bill when come to look at the detail of the bill do not recommend strongly to adoption a brief notice of some of provision will suffice first may justify substantially a system of discount of the most objectionable character be to deal in bill of exchange draw in state and payable in another without any restraint the bill of exchange may have an unlimited time to run and renewability be nowhere guard against may in fact assume the most objectionable form of accommodation paper be not require to rest on any actual real or substantial exchange basis a drawer in place become the accepter in another and so in turn the accepter may become the drawer upon a mutual understanding may at the same time indulge in mere local discount under the name of bill of exchange a bill draw at philadelphia on camden new jersey at new|york on a border town in new|jersey at cincinnati on newport in kentucky not to multiply other example may for anything in this bill to restrain become a mere matter of local accommodation city thus relatively situate would possess advantage over city otherwise situate of so decide a character as most justly to excite dissatisfaction second there be no limit prescribe to the premium in the purchase of bill of exchange thereby correct none of the evil under which the community now labor and operate most injuriously upon the agricultural states in which the irregularity in the rate of exchange be most severely feel nor be these the only consequence a resumption of specie payment by the bank of those state would be liable to indefinite postponement for as the operation of the agency of the interior would chiefly consist in sell bill of exchange and the purchase could only be make in specie or the note of bank pay specie the state bank would either have to continue with door close or exist at the mercy of this national monopoly of brokerage nor can be pass over without remark that whilst the|district|of|columbia be make the seat of the principal bank citizen be exclude from all participation in any benefit may afford by a positive prohibition on the bank from all discount within the district these be some of the objection which prominently exist against the detail of the bill other may be urge of much force but would be unprofitable to dwell upon suffice to add that this charter be design to continue for twenty|year without a competitor that the defect to which have allude be found on the fundamental law of the corporation be irrevocable and that if the objection be well found would be over hazardous to pass the bill into a law in conclusion take leave most respectfully to say that have feel the most anxious solicitude to meet the wish of congress in the adoption of a fiscal agent which avoid all constitutional objection should harmonize conflicting opinion actuate by this feeling have be ready to yield much in a spirit of conciliation to the opinion of other and be with great pain that now feel compelled to differ from congress a second time in the same session at the commencement of this session incline from choice to defer to the legislative will submit to congress the propriety of adopt a fiscal agent which without violate the constitution would separate the public money from the executive control and perform the operation of the treasury without be burdensome to the people or inconvenient or expensive to the government be deeply to be regret that this department of the government can not upon constitutional and other ground concur with the legislative department in this last measure propose to attain these desirable object owe to the brief space between the period of the death of lamented predecessor and own installation into office be in fact not leave time to prepare and submit a definitive recommendation of own in regular message and since mind have be wholly occupy in a most anxious attempt to conform action to the legislative will in this communication be confine by the constitution to objection simply to this bill but the period of the regular session will soon arrive when will be duty under another clause of the constitution to give to congress information of the state of the union and recommend to consideration such measure as shall judge necessary and expedient and most respectfully submit in a spirit of harmony whether the present difference of opinion should be press further at this time and whether the peculiarity of situation do not entitle to a postponement of this subject to a more auspicious period for deliberation the houses|of|congress have distinguish at this extraordinary session by the performance of an immense mass of labor at a season very unfavorable both to health and action and have pass many law which trust will prove highly beneficial to the interest of the country and fully answer just expectation have be good fortune and pleasure to concur with in all measure except this and why should difference on this alone be push to extreme be anxious desire that should not be too have be burden with extraordinary labor of late and sincerely desire time for deep and deliberate reflection on this the great difficulty of administration may not now pause until a more favorable time when with the most anxious hope that the executive and congress may cordially unite some measure of finance may be deliberately adopt promotive of the good of common country will take this occasion to declare that the conclusion to which have bring be those of a settle conviction found in opinion on a just view of the constitution that in arrive at have be actuate by no other motive or desire than to uphold the institution of the country as have come down to from the hand of godlike ancestor and that shall esteem effort to sustain even though perish more honorable than to win the applause of man by a sacrifice of duty and conscience transcript to the senate of the|united|state the bill entitle an act to incorporate the subscriber to the|fiscal|bank|of the|united|state which originate in the senate have be consider by with a sincere desire to conform action in regard to to that of the houses|of|congress by the constitution be make duty either to approve the bill by sign or to return with objection to the house in which originate can not conscientiously give approval and proceed to discharge the duty require of by the constitution to give reason for disapprove the power of congress to create a national bank to operate per over the union have be a question of dispute from the origin of the government man most justly and deservedly esteemed for high intellectual endowment virtue and patriotism have in regard to entertain different and conflicting opinion congress have differ the approval of president have be follow by the disapproval of another the people at different time have acquiesce in decision both for and against the country have be and still be deeply agitate by this unsettled question will suffice for to say that own opinion have be uniformly proclaim to be against the exercise of any such power by this government on all suitable occasion during a period of five|year the opinion thus entertain have be unreservedly express declare in the legislature of native state in the|house|of|representatives of the|united|state have be openly vindicate by in the|senate|chamber in the presence and hearing of many who be at this time member of that body have be affirm and reaffirm in speech and report there make and by vote there record in popular assembly have unhesitatingly announce and the last public declaration which make and that but a short time before the late presidential election refer to previously express opinion as be those then entertain by with a full knowledge of the opinion thus entertain and never conceal be elect by the people vice president of the|united|state by the occurrence of a contingency provide for in the constitution and arise under an impressive dispensation of providence succeed to the presidential office before enter upon the duty of that office take an oath that would preserve protect and defend the|united|state entertain the opinion allude to and have take this oath the senate and the country will see that could not give sanction to a measure of the character describe without surrender all claim to the respect of honorable man all confidence on the part of the people all self respect all regard for moral and religious obligation without an observance of which no government can be prosperous and no people can be happy would be to commit a crime which would not willfully commit to gain any earthly reward and which would justly subject to the ridicule and scorn of all virtuous man deem entirely unnecessary at this time to enter upon the reason which have bring mind to the conviction feel and entertain on this subject have be over and over again repeat if some of those who have precede in this high office have entertain and avow different opinion yield all confidence that conviction be sincere claim only to have the same measure mete out to without go further into the argument will say that in look to the power of this government to collect safely keep and disburse the public revenue and incidentally to regulate the commerce and exchange have not be able to satisfy that the establishment by this government of a bank of discount in the ordinary acceptation of that term be a necessary mean or demand by propriety to execute those power what can the local discount of the bank have to do with the collecting safe keeping and disburse of the revenue so far as the mere discounting of paper be concern be quite immaterial to this question whether the discount be obtain at a state bank or a united|stat bank be both equally local both begin and both end in a local accommodation what influence have local discount grant by any form of bank in the regulating of the currency and the exchange let the history of the late united|states|bank aid in answer this inquiry for several|year after the establishment of that institution deal almost exclusively in local discount and during that period the country be for the most part disappoint in the consequence anticipate from incorporation a uniform currency be not provide exchange be not regulate and little or nothing be add to the general circulation and in embarrassment have become so great that the director petition congress to repeal that article of the charter which make note receivable everywhere in payment of the public due have up to that period deal to but a very small extent in exchange either foreign or domestic and as late as operation in that line amount to a little more than per annum a very rapid augmentation soon after occur and in dealing in the exchange amount to upward of include the sale of own draft and all these immense transaction be effect without the employment of extraordinary mean the currency of the country become sound and the negotiation in the exchange be carry on at the low possible rate the circulation be increase to more|than|$22,000,000 and the note of the bank be regard as equal to specie all over the country thus show almost conclusively that be the capacity to deal in exchange and not in local discount which furnish these facility and advantage may be remark too that notwithstanding the immense transaction of the bank in the purchase of exchange the loss sustain be merely nominal while in the line of discount the suspend debt be enormous and prove most disastrous to the bank and the country power of local discount have in fact prove to be a fruitful source of favoritism and corruption alike destructive to the public moral and to the general weal the capital invest in bank of discount in the|united|state create by the|state at this time exceed and if the discounting of local paper could have produce any beneficial effect the|united|state ought to possess the sound currency in the world but the reverse be lamentably the fact be the measure now under consideration of the objectionable character to which have allude be clearly so unless by the sixteenth fundamental article of the eleventh section be make otherwise that article be in the following word the director of the say corporation shall establish competent office of discount and deposit in any state in which two|thousand share shall have be subscribe or may be hold whenever upon application of the legislature of such state congress may by law require the same and the say director may also establish or more competent office of discount and deposit in any territory or district of the|united|state and in any state with the assent of such state and when establish the said office or office shall be only withdraw or remove by the say director prior to the expiration of this charter with the previous assent of congress provide in respect to any state which shall not at the first session of the legislature thereof hold after the passage of this act by resolution or other usual legislative proceeding unconditionally assent or dissent to the establishment of such office or office within such assent of the say state shall be thereafter presume and provide nevertheless that whenever shall become necessary and proper for carry into execution any of the power grant by the constitution to establish an office or office in any of the states whatever and the establishment thereof shall be direct by law shall be the duty of the say director to establish such office or office accordingly will be see that by this clause the director be invest with the full power to establish a branch in any state which have yield assent and have once establish such branch shall not afterwards be withdraw except by order of congress such assent be to be imply and to have the force and sanction of an actually express assent provide in respect to any state which shall not at the first session of the legislature thereof hold after the passage of this act by resolution or other usual legislative proceeding unconditionally assent or dissent to the establishment of such office or office within such assent of say state shall be thereafter presume the assent or dissent be to be express unconditionally at the first session of the legislature by some formal legislative act and if not so express assent be to be imply and the director be thereupon invest with power at such time thereafter as may please to establish branch which can not afterwards be withdraw except by resolve of congress no matter what may be the cause which may operate with the legislature which either prevent from speak or address to wisdom to induce delay assent be to be imply this iron rule be to give way to no circumstance be unbending and inflexible be the language of the master to the vassal an unconditional answer be claim forthwith and delay postponement or incapacity to answer produce an implied assent which be ever after irrevocable many of the state election have already take place without any knowledge on the part of the people that such a question be to come up the representative may desire a submission of the question to constituent preparatory to final action upon but this high privilege be deny whatever may be the motif and view entertain by the representative of the people to induce delay assent be to be presume and be ever afterwards bind unless dissent shall be unconditionally express at first session after the passage of this bill into a law may by formal resolution declare the question of assent or dissent to be undecided and postpone and yet in opposition to express declaration to the contrary assent be to be imply case innumerable may be cite to manifest the irrationality of such an inference let or in addition suffice the popular branch of the legislature may express dissent by an unanimous vote and resolution may be defeat by a tie vote of the senate and yet the assent be to be imply both branch of the legislature may concur in a resolution of decide dissent and yet the governor may exert the veto power confer on by the state constitution and legislative action be defeat and yet the assent of the legislative authority be imply and the director of this contemplated institution be authorize to establish a branch or branch in such state whenever may find conducive to the interest of the stockholder to do so and have once establish can under no circumstance withdraw except by act of congress the state may afterwards protest against such unjust inference but authority be go assent be imply by failure or inability to act at first session and voice can never afterwards be hear to inference so violent and as seem to irrational can not yield consent no court of justice would or could sanction without reverse all that be establish in judicial proceeding by introduce presumption at variance with fact and inference at the expense of reason a state in a condition of duress would be presume to speak as an individual manacle and in prison may be presume to be in the enjoyment of freedom far better to say to the states boldly and frankly congress will and submission be demand may be say that the director may not establish branch under such circumstance but this be a question of power and this bill invest with full authority to do so if the legislature of new|york or pennsylvania or any other state should be find to be in such condition as have suppose could there be any security furnish against such a step on the part of the director nay be not fairly to be presume that this proviso be introduce for the sole purpose of meet the contingency refer to why else should have be introduce and submit to the senate whether can be believe that any state would be likely to sit quietly down under such a state of thing in a great measure of public interest patriotism may be successfully appeal to but to infer assent from circumstance at war with such inference can not but regard as calculate to excite a feeling at fatal enmity with the peace and harmony of the country must therefore regard this clause as assert the power to be in congress to establish office of discount in a state not only without assent but against dissent and so regard can not sanction on general principle the right in congress to prescribe term to any state imply a superiority of power and control deprive the transaction of all pretense to compact between and terminate as have see in the total abrogation of freedom of action on the part of the states but further the state may express after the most solemn form of legislation dissent which may from time to time thereafter be repeat in full view of own interest which can never be separate from the wise and beneficent operation of this government and yet congress may by virtue of the last proviso overrule law and upon ground which to such state will appear to rest on a constructive necessity and propriety and nothing more regard the bill as assert for congress the right to incorporate a united|stat bank with power and right to establish office of discount and deposit in the several states of this union with or without consent a principle to which have always heretofore be oppose and which can never obtain sanction and waive all other consideration grow out of other provision return to the house in which originate with these objection to approval transcript to the senate and house|of|representatif of the|united|state fellow citizen have be assemble in respective hall of legislation under a proclamation bear the signature of the illustrious citizen who be so lately call by the direct suffrage of the people to the discharge of the important function of chief executive office upon the expiration of a|single|month from of installation have pay the great debt of nature leave behind a name associate with the recollection of numerous benefit confer upon the country during a long life of patriotic devotion with this public bereavement be connected other consideration which will not escape the attention of congress the preparation necessary for removal to the seat of government in view of a residence of four|years must have devolve upon the late president heavy expenditure which if permit to burthen the limited resource of private fortune may tend seriously to the embarrassment of survive family and be therefore respectfully submit to congress whether the ordinary principle of justice would not dictate the propriety of legislative interposition by the provision of the fundamental law the power and duty of the high station to which be elect have devolve upon and in the disposition of the representative of the states and of the people will be find to a great extent a solution of the problem to which institution be for the first time subject in enter upon the duty of this office do not feel that would be become in to disturb what have be order by lamented predecessor whatever therefore may have be opinion originally as to the propriety of convene congress at so|early|a|day from that of late adjournment find a new and control inducement not to interfere with the patriotic desire of the late president in the novelty of the situation in which be so unexpectedly place first wish under such circumstance would necessarily have be to have call to aid in the administration of public affair the combined wisdom of the houses|of|congress in order to take counsel and advice as to the good mode of extricate the government and the country from the embarrassment weigh heavily on both be then most happy in find so soon after accession to the presidency surround by the immediate representative of the states and people no important change have take place in foreign relation since the last session of congress be not deem necessary on this occasion to go into a detailed statement in regard to be happy to say that see nothing to destroy the hope of be able to preserve peace the ratification of the treaty with portugal have be duly exchange between the government this government have not be inattentive to the interest of those of citizen who have claim on the government|of|spain round on express treaty stipulation and a hope be indulge that the representation which have be make to that government on this subject may lead ere long to beneficial result a correspondence have take place between the secretary of state and the minister of her|britannic|majesty accredit to this government on the subject of alexander|mcleod 's indictment and imprisonment copy of which be herewith

of the patriot for the safety of institution the federative system leave to each state the care of domestic concern and devolve on the|federal|government those of general import admit in safety of the great expansion but at the same time deem proper to add that there will be find to exist at all time an imperious necessity for restrain all the functionary of this government within the range of respective power thereby preserve a just balance between the power grant to this government and those reserve to the states and to the people from the report of the secretary of the treasury will

the most beneficial result under a system of discriminate duty impose for purpose of revenue in unison with the provision of exist law be to be hope that policy will in the future be fix and permanent so as to avoid those constant fluctuation which defeat the very object have in view shall thus best maintain a position which while will enable the more readily to meet the advance of other country calculate to promote trade and commerce will at the same time leave in own hand the mean of retaliate with great effect unjust regulation in intimate connection with the question of revenue be that which make provision for a suitable fiscal agent capable of add increase facility in the collection and disbursement of the public revenue render more secure custody and consult a true economy in the great multiply and delicate operation of the|treasury|department upon such an agent depend in an eminent degree the establishment of a currency of uniform value which be of so great importance to all the essential interest of society and on the wisdom to be manifest in creation much depend so intimately interwoven be operation not only with the interest of individual but of states that may be regard to a great degree as control both if paper be use as the chief medium of circulation and the power be vest in the government of issue at pleasure either in the form of treasury draft or any other or if bank be use as the public depository with liberty to regard all surplus from day to day as so much add to active capital price be expose to constant fluctuation and industry to severe suffering in the case political consideration direct to party purpose may control while excessive cupidity may prevail in the other the public be thus constantly liable to imposition expansion and contraction may follow each other in rapid succession the one engender a reckless spirit of adventure and speculation which embrace states as well as individual the other cause a fall in price and accomplish an entire change in the aspect of affair stock of all sort rapidly decline individual be ruin and states embarrass even in effort to meet with punctuality the interest on debt such unhappily be the condition of thing now exist in the|united|state these effect may readily be trace to the cause above refer to the public revenue be remove from the then bank|of|the|united|state under an order of a late president be place in select state bank which actuate by the double motive of conciliate the government and augment profit to the great possible extent enlarge extravagantly discount thus enable all other exist bank to do the same large dividend be declare which stimulate the cupidity of capitalist cause a rush to be make to the legislature of the respective states for similar act of incorporation which by many of the states under a temporary infatuation be readily grant and thus the augmentation of the circulate medium consist almost exclusively of paper produce a most fatal delusion an illustration derive from the land sale of the period allude to will serve best to show the effect of the whole system the average sale of the public land for a period of ten|years|prior|to|1834 have not much exceed per annum in attain in round number to the amount of in the|succeeding|year|of|1835 reach and the|next|year|of|1836 amount to the enormous sum of thus crowd into the short space of three|year upward of three|year ' purchase of the public domain so apparent have become the necessity of arrest this course of thing that the executive department assume the highly questionable power of discriminate in the fund to be use in payment by different class of public debtor a discrimination which be doubtless design to correct this most ruinous state of thing by the exaction of specie in all payment for the public land but which could not at once arrest the tide which have so strongly set in hence the demand for specie become unceasing and correspond prostration rapidly ensue under the necessity create with the bank to curtail discount and thereby to reduce circulation recur to these thing with no disposition to censure preexist administrations|of|the|government but simply in exemplification of the truth of the position which have assume if then any fiscal agent which may be create shall be place without due restriction either in the hand of the administrator of the government or those of private individual the temptation to abuse will prove to be resistless object of political aggrandizement may seduce the first and the prompting of a boundless cupidity will assail the last aid by the experience of the past will be the pleasure of congress so to guard and fortify the public interest in the creation of any new agent as to place so far as human wisdom can accomplish on a footing of perfect security within a|few|years|past|three different scheme have be before the country the charter of the|bank|of|the|united|state expire by own limitation in an effort be make to renew which receive the sanction of the houses|of|congress but the then president of the|united|state exercise veto power and the measure be defeat a regard to truth require to say that the president be fully sustain in the course have take by the popular voice successor to the chair of state unqualifiedly pronounce opposition to any new charter of a similar institution and not only the popular election which bring into power but the election through much of term seem clearly to indicate a concurrence with in sentiment on the part of the people after the public money be withdraw from the|united|states|bank be place in deposit with the state bank and the result of that policy have be before the country to say nothing as to the question whether that experiment be make under propitious or adverse circumstance may safely be assert that do receive the unqualified condemnation of most of early advocate and be believe be also condemn by the popular sentiment the exist subtreasury system do not seem to stand in high favor with the people but have recently be condemn in a manner too plainly indicate to admit of a doubt thus in the short period of eight|year the popular voice may be regard as have successively condemn each of the scheme of finance to which have advert as to the first be introduce at a time when the state bank then comparatively few in number have be force to suspend specie payment by reason of the war which have previously prevail with great|britain whether if the|united|states|bank charter which expire in have be renew in due season would have be enable to continue specie payment during the war and the disastrous period to the commerce of the country which immediately succeed be to say the least problematical and whether the|united|states|bank of produce a restoration of specie payment or the same be accomplish through the instrumentality of other mean be a matter of some difficulty at that time to determine certain be that for the|first|year of the operation of that bank course be as disastrous as for the great part of subsequent career become eminently successful as to the second the experiment be try with a redundant treasury which continue to increase until seem to be the part of wisdom to distribute the surplus revenue among the states which operate at the same time with the specie circular and the cause before advert to cause to suspend specie payment and involve the country in the great embarrassment and as to the third if carry through all the stage of transmutation from paper and specie to nothing but the precious metal to say nothing of the insecurity of the public money injurious effect have be anticipate by the country in unqualified condemnation what be now to be regard as the judgment of the american people on this whole subject have no accurate mean of determining but by appeal to more immediate representative the late contest which terminate in the election of general harrison to the presidency be decide on principle well know and openly declare and while the subtreasury receive in the result the most decided condemnation yet no other scheme of finance seem to have be concur in to then who have come more directly from the body of common constituent submit the entire question as good qualified to give a full exposition of wish and opinion shall be ready to concur with in the adoption of such system as may propose reserve to the ultimate power of reject any measure which may in view of conflict with the constitution or otherwise jeopardize the prosperity of the country a power which could not part with even if would but which will not believe any act of will call into requisition can not avoid recur in connection with this subject to the necessity which exist for adopt some suitable measure whereby the unlimited creation of bank by the states may be correct in future such result can be most readily achieve by the consent of the states to be express in the form of a compact among which can only enter into with the consent and approbation of this government a consent which may in the present emergency of the public demand justifiably be give by congress in advance of any action by the states as an inducement to such action upon term well define by the act of tender such a measure address to the calm reflection of the states would find in the experience of the past and the condition of the present much to sustain and be greatly to be doubt whether any scheme of finance can prove for any length of time successful while the states shall continue in the unrestrained exercise of the power of create banking corporation this power can only be limit by consent with the adoption of a financial agency of a satisfactory character the hope may be indulge that the country may once more return to a state of prosperity measure auxiliary thereto and in some measure inseparably connect with success will doubtless claim the attention of congress among such a distribution of the proceed of the sale of the public land provide such distribution do not force upon congress the necessity of impose upon commerce heavy burthen than those contemplate by the act of would act as an efficient remedial measure by be bring directly in aid of the|state as sincerely devote to the task of preserve a just balance in system of government by the maintenance of the states in a condition the most free and respectable and in the full possession of all power can no otherwise than feel desirous for emancipation from the situation to which the pressure on finance now subject and while must repudiate as a measure found in error and want constitutional sanction the slight approach to an assumption by this government of the debt of the|state yet can see in the distribution advert too much to recommend the compact between the proprietor states and this government expressly guarantee to the states all the benefit which may arise from the sale the mode by which this be to be effect address to the discretion of congress as the trustee for the states and exercise after the most beneficial manner be restrain by nothing in the grant or in the constitution so long as congress shall consult that equality in the distribution which the compact require in the present condition of some of the states the question of distribution may be regard as substantially a question between direct and indirect taxation if the distribution be not make in some form or other the necessity will daily become more urgent with the debtor states for a resort to an oppressive system of direct taxation or credit and necessarily power and influence will be greatly diminish the payment of taxis after the most inconvenient and oppressive mode will be exact in place of contribution for the most part voluntarily make and therefore comparatively unoppressive the states be emphatically the constituent of this government and should be entirely regardless of the object hold in view by in the creation of this government if could be indifferent to good the happy effect of such a measure upon all the states would immediately be manifest with the debtor states would effect the relief to a great extent of the citizen from a heavy burthen of direct taxation which press with severity on the laboring class and eminently assist in restore the general prosperity an immediate advance would take place in the price of the state security and the attitude of the states would become once more as should ever be lofty and erect with states labor under no extreme pressure from debt the fund which would derive from this source would enable to improve condition in an eminent degree so far as this government be concern appropriation to domestic object approach in amount the revenue derive from the land sale may be abandon and thus a system of unequal and therefore unjust legislation would be substitute by dispense equality to all the member of this confederacy whether such distribution should be make directly to the states in the proceed of the sale or in the form of profit by virtue of the operation of any fiscal agency have those proceed as basis should such measure be contemplate by congress would well deserve consideration nor would such disposition of the proceed of the sale in any manner prevent congress from time to time from pass all necessary preemption law for the benefit of actual settler or from make any new arrangement as to the price of the public land which may in future be esteem desirable beg leave particularly to call attention to the accompanying report from the secretary of war besides the present state of the war which have so long afflict the|territory|of|florida and the various other matter of interest therein refer to will learn from that the secretary have institute an inquiry into abuse which promise to develop gross enormity in connection with indian treaty which have be negotiate as well as in the expenditure for the removal and subsistence of the indians represent also other irregularity of a serious nature that have grow up in the practice of the|indian|department which will require the appropriation of upward of to correct and which claim the immediate attention of congress in reflect on the proper mean of defend the country can not shut eye to the consequence which the introduction and use of the power of steam upon the ocean be likely to produce in war between maritime state can not yet see the extent to which this power may be apply in belligerent operation connect as do with recent improvement in the science of gunnery and projectile but need have no fear of be leave in regard to these thing behind the most active and skillful of other nation if the genius and enterprise of fellow citizen receive proper encouragement and direction from government true wisdom would nevertheless seem to dictate the necessity of place in perfect condition those fortification which be design for the protection of principal city and roadstead for the defense of extended maritime coast chief reliance should be place on navy aid by those invention which be destine to recommend to public adoption but no time should be lose in place principal city on the seaboard and the lakes in a state of entire security from foreign assault separate as be from the country of the old world and in much unaffected by policy be happily relieve from the necessity of maintain large stand army in time of peace the policy which be adopt by mr. monroe shortly after the conclusion of the late war with great|britain of preserve a regularly organize staff sufficient for the command of a large military force should a necessity for arise be round as well in economy as in true wisdom provision be thus make upon fill up the rank and file which can readily be do on any emergency for the introduction of a system of discipline both promptly and efficiently all that be require in time of peace be to maintain a sufficient number of man to guard fortification to meet any sudden contingency and to encounter the first shock of war chief reliance must be place on the militia constitute the great body of national guard and inspire by an ardent love of country will be find ready at all time and at all season to repair with alacrity to defense will be regard by congress doubt not at a suitable time as of high duty to attend to complete organization and discipline the state of the navy pension fund require the immediate attention of congress by the operation of the act of the of march entitle an act for the more equitable administration of the navy pension fund that fund have be exhaust will be see from the accompanying report of the commissioner of pensions that there will be require for the payment of navy pension on the|1st|of|july next and on the|1st|of|january,|1842 the sum of in addition to these sum about|$6,000 will be require to pay arrear of pension which will probably be allow between|the|1st|of|july and the|1st|of|january,|1842 make in the whole to meet these payment there be within the control of the department the sum of leave a deficiency of the public faith require that immediate provision should be make for the payment of these sum in order to introduce into the navy a desirable efficiency a new system of accountability may be find to be indispensably necessary to mature a plan have for object the accomplishment of an end so important and to meet the just expectation of the country require more time than have yet be allow to the secretary at the head of the department the hope be indulge that by the time of next regular session measure of importance in connection with this branch of the public service may be mature for consideration although the law regulate the|post office|department only require from the officer charge with direction to report at the usual annual session of congress the|postmaster general have present to some fact connect with the financial condition of the department which be deem worthy the attention of congress by the accompanying report of that officer appear the exist liability of that department beyond the mean of payment at command can not be less|than|$500,000 as the law organize that branch of the public service confine the expenditure to own revenue deficiency therein can not be present under the usual estimate for the expense of government must therefore be leave to congress to determine whether the money now due the contractor shall be pay from the public treasury or whether that department shall continue under present embarrassment will be see by the report of the|postmaster general that the recent letting of contract in several of the states have be make at such reduced rate of compensation as to encourage the belief that if the department be relieve from exist difficulty future operation may be conduct without any further call upon the general treasury the power of appoint to office be of a character the most delicate and responsible the appoint power be evermore expose to be lead into error with anxious solicitude to select the most trustworthy for official station can not be suppose to possess a personal knowledge of the qualification of every applicant deem therefore proper in this most public manner to invite on the part of the senate a just scrutiny into the character and pretension of every person may bring to notice in the regular form of a nomination for office unless person every way trustworthy be employ in the public service corruption and irregularity will inevitably follow shall with the great cheerfulness acquiesce in the decision of that body and regard as wisely constitute to aid the executive department in the performance of this delicate duty shall look to consent and advice as give only in furtherance of the good interest of the country shall also at the early proper occasion invite the attention of congress to such measure as in judgment will be best calculate to regulate and control the executive power in reference to this vitally important subject shall also at the proper season invite attention to the statutory enactment for the suppression of the slave trade which may require to be render more efficient in provision there be reason to believe that the traffic be on the increase whether such increase be to be ascribe to the abolition of slave labor in the british possession in vicinity and an attendant diminution in the supply of those article which enter into the general consumption of the world thereby augment the demand from other quarter and thus call for additional labor be needless to inquire the high consideration of public honor as well as the strong prompting of humanity require a resort to the most vigorous effort to suppress the trade in conclusion beg to invite particular attention to the interest of this district nor do doubt but that in a liberal spirit of legislation will seek to advance commercial as well as local interest should congress deem to be duty to repeal the exist subtreasury law the necessity of provide a suitable place of deposit of the public money which may be require within the district must be apparent to all have feel due to the country to present the forego topic to consideration and reflection other with which may not seem proper to trouble at an extraordinary session will be lay before at a|future|day be happy in commit the important affair of the country into hand the tendency of public sentiment be pleased to believe be toward the adoption in a spirit of union and harmony of such measure as will fortify the public interest to cherish such a tendency of public opinion be the task of an elevated patriotism that difference of opinion as to the mean of accomplish these desirable object should exist be reasonably to be expect nor can all be make satisfied with any system of measure but flatter with the hope that the great body of the people will readily unite in support of those whose effort spring from a disinterested desire to promote happiness to preserve the|federal|and|state|government within respective orbit to cultivate peace with all the nation of the earth on just and honorable ground to exact obedience to the law to intrench liberty and property in full security and consult the most rigid economy to abolish all useless expense transcript to the people of the|united|state fellow citizen before arrival at the seat of government the painful communication be make to by the officer preside over the several departments of the deeply regretted death of william|henry|harrison late president of the|united|state upon have confer suffrage for the first office in gift and have select as choose instrument to correct and reform all such error and abuse as have manifest from time to time in the practical operation of the government while stand at the threshold of this great work have by the dispensation of an all wise providence be remove from amongst and by the provision of the constitution the effort to be direct to the accomplishing of this vitally important task have devolve upon this same occurrence have subject the wisdom and sufficiency of institution to a new test for the first time in history the person elect to the vice presidency of the|united|state by the happening of a contingency provide for in the constitution have have devolve upon the presidential office the spirit of faction which be directly oppose to the spirit of a lofty patriotism may find in this occasion for assault upon administration and in succeed under circumstance so sudden and unexpected and to responsibility so greatly augment to the administration of public affair shall place in the intelligence and patriotism of the people only sure reliance earnest prayer shall be constantly address to the all wise and all powerful being who make and by whose dispensation be call to the high office of president of this confederacy understandingly to carry out the principle of that constitution which have swear to protect preserve and defend the usual opportunity which be afford to a chief magistrate upon induction to office of present to countryman an exposition of the policy which would guide administration in the form of an inaugural address not have under the peculiar circumstance which have bring to the discharge of the high duty of president of the|united|state be afford to a brief exposition of the principle which will govern in the general course of administration of public affair would seem to be due as well to as to in regard to foreign nation the groundwork of policy will be justice on part to all submit to injustice from none while shall sedulously cultivate the relation of peace and amity with and all will be most imperative duty to see that the honor of the country shall sustain no blemish with a view to this the condition of military defense will become a matter of anxious solicitude the army which have in other|days cover with renown and the navy not inappropriately term the right arm of the public defense which have spread a light of glory over the american standard in all the water of the earth should be render replete with efficiency in view of the fact well avouch by history that the tendency of all human institution be to concentrate power in the hand of a single man and that ultimate downfall have proceed from this cause deem of the most essential importance that a complete separation should take place between the sword and the purse no matter where or how the public money shall be deposit so long as the president can exert the power of appointing and remove at pleasure the agent select for custody the commander in chief of the army and navy be in fact the treasurer a permanent and radical change should therefore be decree the patronage incident to the presidential office already great be constantly increase such increase be destine to keep pace with the growth of population until without a figure of speech an army of officeholder may be spread over the land the unrestrained power exert by a selfishly ambitious man in order either to perpetuate authority or to hand over to some favorite as successor may lead to the employment of all the mean within control to accomplish object the right to remove from office while subject to no just restraint be inevitably destine to produce a spirit of crouch servility with the official corps which in order to uphold the hand which feed would lead to direct and active interference in the election both state and federal thereby subject the course of state legislation to the dictation of the chief executive officer and make the will of that officer absolute and supreme will at a proper time invoke the action of congress upon this subject and shall readily acquiesce in the adoption of all proper measure which be calculate to arrest these evil so full of danger in tendency will remove no incumbent from office who have faithfully and honestly acquit of the duty of office except in such case where such officer have be guilty of an active partisanship or by secret mean the less manly and therefore the more objectionable have give official influence to the purpose of party thereby bring the patronage of the government in conflict with the freedom of election numerous removal may become necessary under this rule these will be make by through no acerbity of feeling have have no cause to cherish or indulge unkind feeling toward any but conduct will be regulate by a profound sense of what be due to the country and institution nor shall neglect to apply the same unbending rule to those of own appointment freedom of opinion will be tolerate the full enjoyment of the right of suffrage will be maintain as the birthright of every american citizen but say emphatically to the official corps thus far and no farther have dwell the longer upon this subject because removal from office be likely often to arise and would have countryman to understand the principle of the executive action in all public expenditure the most rigid economy should be resort to and as of result a public debt in time of peace be sedulously avoid a wise and patriotic constituency will never object to the imposition of necessary burden for useful end and true wisdom dictate the resort to such mean in order to supply deficiency in the revenue rather than to those doubtful expedient which ultimate in a public debt serve to embarrass the resource of the country and to lessen ability to meet any great emergency which may arise all sinecure should be abolish the appropriation should be direct and explicit so as to leave as limit a share of discretion to the disburse agent as may be find compatible with the public service a strict responsibility on the part of all the agent of the government should be maintain and peculation or defalcation visit with immediate expulsion from office and the most condign punishment the public interest also demand that if any war have exist between the government and the currency shall cease measure of a financial character now have the sanction of legal enactment shall be faithfully enforce until repeal by the legislative authority but owe to to declare that regard exist enactment as unwise and impolitic and in a high degree oppressive shall promptly give sanction to any constitutional measure which originate in congress shall have for object the restoration of a sound circulate medium so essentially necessary to give confidence in all the transaction of life to secure to industry just and adequate reward and to reestablish the public prosperity in decide upon the adaptation of any such measure to the end propose as well as conformity to the constitution shall resort to the father of the great republican school for advice and instruction to be draw from sage view of system of government and the light of ever glorious example the institution under which live countryman secure each person in the perfect enjoyment of all right the spectacle be exhibit to the world of a government derive power from the consent of the govern and have impart to only so much power as be necessary for successful operation those who be charge with administration should carefully abstain from all attempt to enlarge the range of power thus grant to the several department of the government other than by an appeal to the people for additional grant lest by so do disturb that balance which the patriot and statesman who frame the constitution design to establish between the|federal|government and the states compose the union the observance of these rule be enjoin upon by that feeling of reverence and affection which find a place in the heart of every patriot for the preservation of union and the blessing of union for the good of child and child 's child through countless generation an opposite course could not fail to generate faction intent upon the gratification of selfish end to give birth to local and sectional jealousy and to ultimate either in break asunder the bond of union or in build up a central system which would inevitably end in a bloody scepter and an iron crown in conclusion beg to be assure that shall exert to carry the forego principle into practice during administration of the government and confide in the protect care of an everwatchful and overrule providence shall be first and high duty to preserve unimpaired the free institution under which live and transmit to those who shall succeed in full force and vigor transcript call from a retirement which have suppose be to continue for the residue of life to fill the chief executive office of this great and free nation appear before fellow citizen to take the oath which the constitution prescribe as a necessary qualification for the performance of duty and in obedience to a custom coeval with government and what believe to be expectation proceed to present to a summary of the principle which will govern in the discharge of the duty which shall be call upon to perform be the remark of a roman consul in an early period of that celebrate republic that a most striking contrast be observable in the conduct of candidate for office of power and trust before and after obtain seldom carry out in the latter case the pledge and promise make in the former however much the world may have improve in many respect in the lapse of upward of two|thousand|years since the remark be make by the virtuous and indignant roman fear that a strict examination of the annal of some of the modern elective government would develop similar instance of violate confidence although the fiat of the people have go forth proclaim the chief magistrate of this glorious union nothing upon part remain to be do may be think that a motive may exist to keep up the delusion under which may be suppose to have act in relation to principle and opinion and perhaps there may be some in this assembly who have come here either prepare to condemn those shall now deliver or approve to doubt the sincerity with which be now uttered but the lapse of a|few|month will confirm or dispel fear the outline of principle to govern and measure to be adopt by an administration not yet begin will soon be exchange for immutable history and shall stand either exonerate by countryman or class with the mass of those who promise that may deceive and flatter with the intention to betray however strong may be present purpose to realize the expectation of a magnanimous and confide people too well understand the dangerous temptation to which shall be expose from the magnitude of the power which have be the pleasure of the people to commit to hand not to place chief confidence upon the aid of that almighty|power which have hitherto protect and enable to bring to favorable issue other important but still greatly inferior trust heretofore confide to by country the broad foundation upon which constitution rest be the people a breath of have make as a breath can unmake change or modify can be assign to none of the great division of government but to that of democracy if such be theory those who be call upon to administer must recognize as lead principle the duty of shape measure so as to produce the great good to the great number but with these broad admission if would compare the sovereignty acknowledge to exist in the mass of people with the power claim by other sovereignty even by those which have be consider most purely democratic shall find a most essential difference all other lie claim to power limit only by own will the majority of citizen on the contrary possess a sovereignty with an amount of power precisely equal to that which have be grant to by the party to the national compact and nothing beyond admit of no government by divine right believe that so far as power be concern the|beneficent|creator have make no distinction amongst man that all be upon an equality and that the only legitimate right to govern be an express grant of power from the govern the|constitution|of the|united|state be the instrument contain this grant of power to the several department compose the government on an examination of that instrument will be find to contain declaration of power grant and of power withhold the latter be also susceptible of division into power which the majority have the right to grant but which do not think proper to intrust to agent and that which could not have grant not be possess by in other word there be certain right possess by each individual american citizen which in compact with the other have never surrender some of indeed be unable to surrender be in the language of system unalienable the boasted privilege of a roman citizen be to a shield only against a petty provincial ruler whilst the proud democrat of athens would console under a sentence of death for a suppose violation of the national faith which no one understand and which at time be the subject of the mockery of all — or the banishment from home family and country with or without an allege cause that be the act not of a single tyrant or hated aristocracy but of assemble countryman far different be the power of sovereignty can interfere with no one 's faith prescribe form of worship for no one 's observance inflict no punishment but after well ascertain guilt the result of investigation under rule prescribe by the constitution these precious privilege and those scarcely less important of give expression to thought and opinion either by write or speak unrestrained but by the liability for injury to other and that of a full participation in all the advantage which flow from the government the acknowledge property of all the american citizen derive from no charter grant by fellow man claim because be a man fashion by the same almighty hand as the rest of specie and entitle to a full share of the blessing with which have endow notwithstanding the limited sovereignty possess by the people of the|united|stage and the restricted grant of power to the government which have adopt enough have be give to accomplish all the object for which be create have be find powerful in war and hitherto justice have be administer and intimate union effect domestic tranquillity preserve and personal liberty secure to the citizen as be to be expect however from the defect of language and the necessarily sententious manner in which the constitution be write dispute have arise as to the amount of power which have actually grant or be intend to grant this be more particularly the case in relation to that part of the instrument which treat of the legislative branch and not only as regard the exercise of power claim under a general clause give that body the authority to pass all law necessary to carry into effect the specify power but in relation to the latter also be however consolatory to reflect that most of the instance of alleged departure from the letter or spirit of the constitution have ultimately receive the sanction of a majority of the people and the fact that many of statesman most distinguished for talent and patriotism have be at time or other of political career on both side of each of the most warmly dispute question force upon the inference that the error if error there be be attributable to the intrinsic difficulty in many instance of ascertain the intention of the framer of the constitution rather than the influence of any sinister or unpatriotic motive but the great danger to institution do not appear to to be in a usurpation by the government of power not grant by the people but by the accumulation in of the department of that which be assign to other limit as be the power which have be grant still enough have be grant to constitute a despotism if concentrate in of the department this danger be greatly heighten as have be always observable that man be less jealous of encroachment of department upon another than upon own reserved right when first come from the hand of the convention which form many of the stern republican of the|day be alarm at the extent of the power which have be grant to the|federal|government and more particularly of that portion which have be assign to the executive branch there be in feature which appear not to be in harmony with idea of a simple representative democracy or republic and know the tendency of power to increase particularly when exercise by a single individual prediction be make that at no very remote period the government would terminate in virtual monarchy would not become to say that the fear of these patriot have be already realize but as sincerely believe that the tendency of measure and of man 's opinion for some|years past have be in that direction be conceive strictly proper that should take this occasion to repeat the assurance have heretofore give of determination to arrest the progress of that tendency if really exist and restore the government to pristine health and vigor as far as this can be effect by any legitimate exercise of the power place in hand proceed to state in as summary a manner as can opinion of the source of the evil which have be so extensively complain of and the corrective which may be apply some of the former be unquestionably to be find in the defect of the constitution other in judgment be attributable to a misconstruction of some of provision of the former be the eligibility of the same individual to a second term of the presidency the sagacious mind of mr. jefferson early see and lament this error and attempt have be make hitherto without success to apply the amendatory power of the states to correction as however mode of correction be in the power of every president and consequently in mine would be useless and perhaps invidious to enumerate the evil of which in the opinion of many of fellow citizen this error of the sage who frame the constitution may have be the source and the bitter fruit which be still to gather from if continue to disfigure system may be observe however as a general remark that republic can commit no great error than to adopt or continue any feature in system of government which may be calculate to create or increase the lover of power in the bosom of those to whom necessity oblige to commit the management of affair and surely nothing be more likely to produce such a state of mind than the long continuance of an office of high trust nothing can be more corrupting nothing more destructive of all those noble feeling which belong to the character of a devoted republican patriot when this corrupt passion once take possession of the human mind like the love of gold become insatiable be the never die worm in bosom grow with growth and strengthen with of victim if this be true be the part of wisdom for a republic to limit the service of that officer at least to whom have intrust the management of foreign relation the execution of law and the command of army and navy to a period so short as to prevent forgetting that be the accountable agent not the principal the servant not the master until an amendment of the constitution can be effect public opinion may secure the desire object give aid to by renew the pledge heretofore give that under no circumstance will consent to serve a second term but if there be danger to public liberty from the acknowledge defect of the constitution in the want of limit to the continuance of the executive power in the same hand there be apprehend not much less from a misconstruction of that instrument as regard the power actually give can not conceive that by a fair construction any or either of provision would be find to constitute the president a part of the legislative power can not be claim from the power to recommend since although enjoin as a duty upon be a privilege which hold in common with every other citizen and although there may be something more of confidence in the propriety of the measure recommend in the case than in the other in the obligation of ultimate decision there can be no difference in the language of the constitution all the legislative power which grant be vest in the congress of the|united|state would be a solecism in language to say that any portion of these be not include in the whole may be say indeed that the constitution have give to the executive the power to annul the act of the legislative body by refuse to assent so a similar power have necessarily result from that instrument to the judiciary and yet the judiciary form no part of the legislature there be be true this difference between these grant of power the executive can put negative upon the act of the legislature for other cause than that of want of conformity to the constitution whilst the judiciary can only declare void those which violate that instrument but the decision of the judiciary be final in such a case whereas in every instance where the veto of the executive be apply may be overcome by a vote of third of both houses|of|congress the negative upon the act of the legislative by the executive authority and that in the hand of individual would seem to be an incongruity in system like some other of asimilar character however appear to be highly expedient and if use only with the forbearance and in the spirit which be intend by author may be productive of great good and be find of the good safeguard to the union at the period of the formation of the constitution the principle do not appear to have enjoy much favor in the state government exist but in and in of these there be a plural executive if would search for the motif which operate upon the purely patriotic and nlightened assembly which frame the constitution for the adoption of a provision so apparently repugnant to the lead democratic principle that the majority should govern must reject the idea that anticipate from any benefit to the ordinary course of legislation know too well the high degree of intelligence which exist among the people and the enlighten character of the state legislature not to have the full confidence that the body elect by would be worthy representative of such constituent and of course that would require no aid in conceive and mature the measure which the circumstance of the country may require and be preposterous to suppose that a thought could for a moment have be entertain that the president place at the capital in the center of the country could better understand the want and wish of the people than own immediate representative who spend a part of every year among live with often labor with and bind to by the triple tie of interest duty and affection to assist or control congress then in ordinary legislation could not conceive have be the motive for confer the veto power on the president this argument acquire additional force from the fact of never have be thus use by the first president and of be member of the convention preside over deliberation and the other bear a large share in consummate the labor of that august body than any other person but if bill be never return to congress by either of the president above refer to upon the ground of be inexpedient or not as well adapt as may be to the want of the people the veto be apply upon that of want of conformity to the constitution or because error have be commit from a too hasty enactment there be another ground for the adoption of the veto principle which have probably more influence in recommend to the convention than any other refer to the security which give to the just and equitable action of the legislature upon all part of the union could not but have occur to the convention that in a country so extensive embrace so great a variety of soil and climate and consequently of product and which from the same cause must ever exhibit a great difference in the amount of the population of various section call for a great diversity in the employment of the people that the legislation of the majority may not always justly regard the right and interest of the minority and that act of this character may be pass under an express grant by the word of the constitution and therefore not within the competency of the judiciary to declare void that however enlighten and patriotic may suppose from past experience the member of congress may be and however largely partake in the general of the liberal feeling of the people be impossible to expect that body so constitute should not sometimes be control by local interest and sectional feeling be proper therefore to provide some umpire from whose situation and mode of appointment more independence and freedom from such influence may be expect such a one be afford by the executive department constitute by the constitution a person elect to that high office have constituent in every section state and subdivision of the union must consider bind by the most solemn sanction to guard protect and defend the right of all and of every portion great or small from the injustice and oppression of the rest consider the veto power therefore give by the constitution to the executive of the|united|state solely as a conservative power to be use only first to protect the constitution from violation secondly the people from the effect of hasty legislation where will have be probably disregard or not well understand and thirdly to prevent the effect of combination violative of the right of minority in reference to the second of these object may observe that consider the right and privilege of the people to decide dispute point of the constitution arise from the general grant of power to congress to carry into effect the power expressly give and believe with mr. madison that repeat recognition under varied circumstance in act of the legislative executive and judicial branch of the government accompany by indication in different mode of the concurrence of the general will of the nation as afford to the president sufficient authority for consider such dispute point as settle upward of half|a|century have elapse since the adoption of the present form of government would be an object more highly desirable than the gratification of the curiosity of speculative statesman if precise situation could be ascertain a fair exhibit make of the operation of each of department of the power which respectively claim and exercise of the collision which have occur between or between the whole government and those of the states or either of could then compare actual condition after fifty|years ' trial of system with what be in the commencement of operation and ascertain whether the prediction of the patriot who oppose adoption or the confident hope of advocate have be best realize the great dread of the former seem to have be that the reserve power of the states would be absorb by those of the|federal|government and a consolidated power establish leave to the states the shadow only of that independent action for which have so zealously contend and on the preservation of which rely as the last hope of liberty without deny that the result to which look with so much apprehension be in the way of be realize be obvious that do not clearly see the mode of accomplishment the|general|government have seize upon none of the reserve right of the states as far as any open warfare may have go the state authority have amply maintain right to a casual observer system present no appearance of discord between the different member which compose even the addition of many new one have produce no jarring move in respective orbit in perfect harmony with the central head and with each other but there be still an undercurrent at work by which if not seasonably check the bad apprehension of antifederal patriot will be realize and not only will the state authority be overshadow by the great increase of power in the executive department of the|general|government but the character of that government if not designation be essentially and radically change this state of thing have be in part effect by cause inherent in the constitution and in part by the never fail tendency of political power to increase by make the president the sole distributer of all the patronage of the government the framer of the constitution do not appear to have anticipate at how short a period would become a formidable instrument to control the free operation of the state government of trifle importance at first have early in mr. jefferson 's administration become so powerful as to create great alarm in the mind of that patriot from the potent influence may exert in control the freedom of the elective franchise if such could have then be the effect of influence how much great must be the danger at this time quadruple in amount as certainly be and more completely under the control of the executive will than construction of power allow or the forbear character of all the early presidents permit to make but be not by the extent of patronage alone that the executive department have become dangerous but by the use which appear may be make of the appoint power to bring under control the whole revenue of the country the constitution have declare to be the duty of the president to see that the law be execute and make the commander in chief of the armies and navy of the|united|state if the opinion of the most approve writer upon that specie of mixed government which in modern europe be term monarchy in contradistinction to despotism be correct there be want no other addition to the power of chief magistrate to stamp a monarchical character on government but the control of the public finance and to appear strange indeed that anyone should doubt that the entire control which the president possess over the officer who have the custody of the public money by the power of removal with or without cause do for all mischievous purpose at least virtually subject the treasure also to disposal the first roman emperor in attempt to seize the sacred treasure silence the opposition of the officer to whose charge have be commit by a significant allusion to sword by a selection of political instrument for the care of the public money a reference to commission by a president would be quite as effectual an argument as that of caesar to the roman knight be not insensible of the great difficulty that exist in draw a proper plan for the safe- keeping and disbursement of the public revenue and know the importance which have be attach by man of great ability and patriotism to the divorce as be call of the treasury from the banking institution be not the divorce which be complain of but the unhallowed union of the treasury with the executive department which have create such extensive alarm to this danger to republican institution and that create by the influence give to the executive through the instrumentality of the federal officer propose to apply all the remedy which may be at command be certainly a great error in the framer of the constitution not to have make the officer at the head of entirely independent of the executive should at least have be removable only upon the demand of the popular branch of the legislature have determine never to remove a secretary of the treasury without communicate all the circumstance attend such removal to both houses|of|congress the influence of the executive in control the freedom of the elective franchise through the medium of the public officer can be effectually check by renew the prohibition publish by mr. jefferson forbid interference in election further than give own vote and own independence secure by an assurance of perfect immunity in exercise this sacred privilege of freeman under the dictate of own unbiased judgment never with consent shall an officer of the people compensate for service out of pocket become the pliant instrument of executive will there be no part of the mean place in the hand of the executive which may be use with great effect for unhallowed purpose than the control of the public press the maxim which ancestor derive from the mother country that the freedom of the press be the great bulwark of civil and religious liberty be of the most precious legacy which have leave have learn too from own as well as the experience of other country that golden shackle by whomsoever or by whatever pretense impose be as fatal to as the iron bond of despotism the press in the necessary employment of the government should never be use to clear the guilty or to varnish crime a decent and manly examination of the act of the government should be not only tolerate but encourage upon another occasion have give opinion at some length upon the impropriety of executive interference in the legislation of congress — that the article in the constitution make the duty of the president to communicate information and authorize to recommend measure be not intend to make the source in legislation and in particular that should never be look to for scheme of finance would be very strange indeed that the constitution should have strictly forbid branch of the legislature from interfere in the origination of such bill and that should be consider proper that an altogether different department of the government should be permit to do so some of good political maxim and opinion have be draw from parent isle there be other however which can not be introduce in system without singular incongruity and the production of much mischief and this conceive to be no matter in which of the house of parliament a bill may originate nor by whom introduce — a minister or a member of the opposition by the fiction of law or rather of constitutional principle the sovereign be suppose to have prepare agreeably to will and then submit to parliament for advice and consent now the very reverse be the case here not only with regard to the principle but the form prescribe by the constitution the principle certainly assign to the only body constitute by the|constitution the legislative body the power to make law and the form even direct that the enactment should be ascribe to the senate in relation to revenue bill have the right to propose amendment and so have the executive by the power give to return to the|house|of|representatives with objection be in power also to propose amendment in the exist revenue law suggest by observation upon defective or injurious operation but the delicate duty of devising scheme of revenue should be leave where the constitution have place with the immediate representative of the people for similar reason the mode of keep the public treasure should be prescribe by and the further remove may be from the control of the executive the more wholesome the arrangement and the more in accordance with republican principle connect with this subject be the character of the currency the idea of make exclusively metallic however well intend appear to to be fraught with more fatal consequence than any other scheme have no relation to the personal right of the citizen that have ever be devise if any single scheme could produce the effect of arrest at once that mutation of condition by which thousand of most indigent fellow citizen by industry and enterprise be raise to the possession of wealth that be the if there be measure better calculated than another to produce that state of thing so much deprecate by all true republican by which the rich be daily add to hoard and the poor sinking deeper into penury be an exclusive metallic currency or if there be a process by which the character of the country for generosity and nobleness of feeling may be destroy by the great increase and neck toleration of usury be an exclusive metallic currency amongst the other duty of a delicate character which the president be call upon to perform be the supervision of the government of the|territories|of|the|united|state those of which be destine to become member of great political family be compensate by rapid progress from infancy to manhood for the partial and temporary deprivation of political right be in this district only where american citizen be to be find who under a settle policy be deprive of many important political privilege without any inspire hope as to the future only consolation under circumstance of such deprivation be that of the devoted exterior guard of a camp that suffering secure tranquillity and safety within be there any of countryman who would subject to great sacrifice to any other humiliation than those essentially necessary to the security of the object for which be thus separate from fellow citizen be right alone not to be guarantee by the application of those great principle upon which all constitutions be found be tell by the great of british orator and statesman that at the commencement of the|war|of|the|revolution the most stupid man in england speak of american subject be there indeed citizen of any of state who have dream of subject in such dream can never be realize by any agency of mine the people of the|district|of|columbia be not the subject of the people of the states but free american citizen be in the latter condition when the constitution be form no word use in that instrument could have be intend to deprive of that character if there be anything in the great principle of unalienable right so emphatically insist upon in declaration of independence could neither make nor the|united|state accept a surrender of liberty and become the subject in other word the slave of former fellow citizen if this be true and will scarcely be deny by anyone who have a correct idea of own right as an american citizen the grant to congress of exclusive jurisdiction in the|district|of|columbia can be interpret so far as respect the aggregate people of the|united|state as mean nothing more than to allow to congress the control power necessary to afford a free and safe exercise of the function assign to the|general|government by the constitution in all other respect the legislation of congress should be adapt to peculiar position and want and be conformable with deliberate opinion of own interest have speak of the necessity of keep the respective department of the government as well as all the other authority of country within appropriate orbit this be a matter of difficulty in some case as the power which respectively claim be often not define by any distinct line mischievous however in tendency as collision of this kind may be those which arise between the respective community which for certain purpose compose nation be much more so for no such nation can long exist without the careful culture of those feeling of confidence and affection which be the effective bond to union between free and confederated state strong as be the tie of interest have be often find ineffectual man blind by passion have be know to adopt measure for country in direct opposition to all the suggestion of policy the alternative then be to destroy or keep down a bad passion by create and foster a good one and this seem to be the corner stone upon which american political architect have rear the fabric of government the cement which be to bind and perpetuate existence be the affectionate attachment between all member to insure the continuance of this feeling produce at first by a community of danger of suffering and of interest the advantage of each be make accessible to all no participation in any good possess by any member of extensive confederacy except in domestic government be withhold from the citizen of any other member by aprocess attend with no difficulty no delay no expense but that of removal the citizen of one may become the citizen of any other and successively of the whole the line too separate power to be exercise by the citizen of state from those of another seem to be so distinctly draw as to leave no room for misunderstanding the citizen of each state unite in person all the privilege which that character confer and all that may claim as citizen of the|united|state but in no case can the same person at the same time act as the citizen of separate states and be therefore positively precluded from any interference with the reserve power of any state but that of which be for the time be a citizen may indeed offer to the citizen of other states advice as to management and the form in which be tender be leave to own discretion and sense of propriety may be observe however that organize association of citizen require compliance with wish too much resemble the recommendation of athens to ally support by an armed and powerful fleet be indeed to the ambition of the lead states of greece to control the domestic concern of the other that the destruction of that celebrate confederacy and subsequently of all member be mainly to be attribute and be owe to the absence of that spirit that the|helvetic|confederacy have for so|many|year be preserve never have there be see in the institution of the separate member of any confederacy more element of discord in the principle and form of government and religion as well as in the circumstance of the several cantons so mark a discrepancy be observable as to promise anything but harmony in intercourse or permanency in alliance and yet for age neither have be interrupt content with the positive benefit which union produce with the independence and safety from foreign aggression which secure these sagacious people respect the institution of each other however repugnant to own principle and prejudice confederacy fellow citizen can only be preserve by the same forbearance citizen must be content with the exercise of the power with which the constitution clothe the attempt of those of state to control the domestic institution of another can only result in feeling of distrust and jealousy the certain harbinger of disunion violence and civil war and the ultimate destruction of free institution confederacy be perfectly illustrate by the term and principle govern a common copartnership there be a fund of power to be exercise under the direction of the joint council of the ally member but that which have be reserve by the individual member be intangible by the common government or the individual member compose to attempt find no support in the principle of constitution should be constant and earnest endeavor mutually to cultivate a spirit of concord and harmony among the various part of confederacy experience have abundantly teach that the agitation by citizen of part of the|union|of|a|subject not confide to the|general|government but exclusively under the guardianship of the local authority be productive of no other consequence than bitterness alienation discord and injury to the very cause which be intend to be advanced of all the great interest which appertain to country that of union cordial confide fraternal union be by far the most important since be the only true and sure guaranty of all other in consequence of the embarrassed state of business and the currency some of the states may meet with difficulty in financial concern however deeply may regret anything imprudent or excessive in the engagement into which state have enter for purpose of own do not become to disparage the states government nor to discourage from make proper effort for own relief on the contrary be duty to encourage to the extent of constitutional authority to apply good mean and cheerfully to make all necessary sacrifice and submit to all necessary burden to fulfill engagement and maintain credit for the character and credit of the several states form a part of the character and credit of the whole country the resource of the country be abundant the enterprise and activity of people proverbial and may well hope that wise legislation and prudent administration by the respective government each act within own sphere will restore former prosperity unpleasant and even dangerous as collision may sometimes be between the constitute authority of the citizen of country in relation to the line which separate respective jurisdiction the result can be of no vital injury to institution if that ardent patriotism that devote attachment to liberty that spirit of moderation and forbearance for which countryman be once distinguished continue to be cherish if this continue to be the rule passion of soul the weak feeling of the mistaken enthusiast will be correct the utopian dream of the scheming politician dissipate and the complicated intrigue of the demagogue render harmless the spirit of liberty be the sovereign balm for every injury which institution may receive on the contrary no care that can be use in the construction of government no division of power no distribution of check in several department will prove effectual to keep a free people if this spirit be suffer to decay and decay will without constant nurture to the neglect of this duty the good historian agree in attribute the ruin of all the republic with whose existence and fall writing have make acquaint the same cause will ever produce the same effect and as long as the love of power be a dominant passion of the human bosom and as long as the understanding of man can be warp and affection change by operation upon passion and prejudice so long will the liberty of a people depend on own constant attention to preservation the danger to all well establish free government arise from the unwillingness of the people to believe in existence or from the influence of design man divert attention from the|quarter whence approach to a source from which can never come this be the old trick of those who would usurp the government of country in the name of democracy speak warn the people against the influence of wealth and the danger of aristocracy history ancient and modern be full of such example caesar become the master of the roman people and the senate under the pretense of support the democratic claim of the former against the aristocracy of the latter cromwell in the character of protector of the liberty of the people become the dictator of england and bolivar possess of unlimited power with the title of country 's liberator there be on the contrary no instance on record of an extensive and well- establish republic be change into an aristocracy the tendency of all such government in decline be to monarchy and the antagonist principle to liberty there be the spirit of faction a spirit which assume the character and in time of great excitement impose upon the people as the genuine spirit of freedom and like the false christs whose come be foretell by the savior seek to and be possible would impose upon the true and most faithful disciple of liberty be in period like this that behoove the people to be most watchful of those to whom have intrust power and although there be at time much difficulty in distinguish the false from the true spirit a calm and dispassionate investigation will detect the counterfeit as well by the character of operation as the result that be produce the true spirit of liberty although devoted persevere bold and uncompromise in principle that secure be mild and tolerant and scrupulous as to the mean employ whilst the spirit of party assume to be that of liberty be harsh vindictive and intolerant and totally reckless as to the character of the ally which bring to the aid of cause when the genuine spirit of liberty animate the body of a people to a thorough examination of affair lead to the excision of every excrescence which may have fasten upon any of the department of the government and restore the system to pristine health and beauty but the reign of an intolerant spirit of party amongst a free people seldom fail to result in a dangerous accession to the executive power introduce and establish amidst unusual profession of devotion to democracy the forego remark relate almost exclusively to matter connect with domestic concern may be proper however that should give some indication to fellow citizen of propose course of conduct in the management of foreign relation assure therefore that be intention to use every mean in power to preserve the friendly intercourse which now so happily subsist with every foreign nation and that although of course not well inform as to the state of pende negotiation with any of see in the personal character of the sovereign as well as in the mutual interest of own and of the government with which relation be most intimate a pleasing guaranty that the harmony so important to the interest of subject as well as of citizen will not be interrupt by the advancement of any claim or pretension upon part to which honor would not permit to yield long the defender of country 's right in the field trust that fellow citizen will not see in earnest desire to preserve peace with foreign power any indication that right will ever be sacrifice or the honor of the nation tarnish by any admission on the part of chief magistrate unworthy of former glory in intercourse with aboriginal neighbor the same liberality and justice which mark the course prescribe to by of illustrious predecessor when act under direction in the discharge of the duty of superintendent and commissioner shall be strictly observe can conceive of no more sublime spectacle none more likely to propitiate an impartial and common creator than a rigid adherence to the principle of justice on the part of a powerful nation in transaction with aweaker and uncivilized people whom circumstance have place at disposal before conclude fellow citizen must say something to on the subject of the party at this time exist in country to appear perfectly clear that the interest of that country require that the violence of the spirit by which those party be at this time govern must be greatly mitigate if not entirely extinguish or consequence will ensue which be appal to be think of if party in a republic be necessary to secure a degree of vigilance sufficient to keep the public functionary within the bound of law and duty at that point usefulness end beyond that become destructive of public virtue the parent of a spirit antagonist to that of liberty and eventually inevitable conqueror have example of republic where the love of country and of liberty at time be the dominant passion of the whole mass of citizen and yet with the continuance of the name and form of free government not a vestige of these quality remain in the bosom of any of citizen be the beautiful remark of a distinguished english writer that in the roman senate octavius have a party and anthony a party but the commonwealth have none yet the senate continue to meet in the temple of liberty to talk of the sacredness and beauty of the commonwealth and gaze at the statue of the eld brutus and of the curtii and decii and the people assemble in the forum not as in the day of camillus and the scipios to cast free vote for annual magistrate or pass upon the act of the senate but to receive from the hand of the leader of the respective party share of the spoil and to shout for or the other as those collect in gaul or egypt and the less asia would furnish the large dividend the spirit of liberty have flee and avoid the abode of civilized man have seek protection in the wild of scythia or scandinavia and so under the operation of the same cause and influence will fly from capitol and forum a calamity so awful not only to country but to the world must be deprecate by every patriot and every tendency to a state of

line thence to be presume that the work will be conclude in the|present|season the present sound condition of finance and the success with which embarrassment in regard to at time apparently insurmountable have be overcome be matter upon which the people and government of the|united|state may well congratulate an overflow treasury however may be regard as an evidence of public prosperity be seldom conducive to the permanent welfare of any people and experience have demonstrate incompatibility with the salutary action of political institution like those of the|united|state safe reliance for financial efficiency and independence have on the contrary be find to consist in ample resource unencumbered with debt and in this respect the federal government occupy a singularly fortunate and truly enviable position when enter upon the discharge of official duty in march,|1837 the act for the distribution of the surplus revenue be in a course of rapid execution nearly|$28,000,000 of the public money be in pursuance of provision deposit with the state in the|months|of|january,|april and july|of|that|year in may there occur a general suspension of specie payment by the bank include with very few exception those in which the public money be deposit and upon whose fidelity the government have unfortunately make dependent for the revenue which have be collect from the people and be indispensable to the public service this suspension and the excess in banking and commerce out of which arise and which be greatly aggravate by occurrence make to a great extent unavailable the principal part of the public money then on hand suspend the collection of many million accrue on merchant ' bond and greatly reduce the revenue arise from custom and the public land these effect have continue to operate in various degree to the present period and in addition to the decrease in the revenue thus produce two|and|a|half|million of duty have be relinquish by biennial reduction under the act of and probably as much more upon the importation of iron for railroad by special legislation whilst such have be condition for the|last|four|years in relation to revenue have during the same period be subject to an unavoidable continuance of large extraordinary expense necessarily grow out of past transaction and which could not be immediately arrest without great prejudice to the public interest of these the charge upon the treasurer in consequence of the cherokee treaty alone without advert to other arise out of indian treaty have already exceed that for the prosecution of measure for the removal of the|seminole|indian which be find in progress have be nearly|14|million and the public building have require the unusual sum of nearly|three|millions afford however great pleasure to be able to say that from the commencement of this period to the present day every demand upon the government at home or abroad have be promptly meet this have be do not only without create a permanent debt or a resort to additional taxation in any form but in the midst of a steadily progressive reduction of exist burden upon the people leave still a considerable balance of available fund which will remain in the treasury at the|end|of|the|year the small amount of treasury note not exceed still outstanding and less by 23|million than the|united|state have in deposit with the state be compose of such only as be not yet due or have not be present for payment may be redeem out of the accrue revenue if the expenditure do not exceed the amount within which may be think be keep without prejudice to the public interest and the revenue shall prove to be as large as may justly be anticipate among the reflection arise from the contemplation of these circumstance not the least gratifying be the consciousness that the government have the resolution and the ability to adhere in every emergency to the sacred obligation of law to execute all contract accord to the requirement of the constitution and thus to present when most need a rallying point by which the business of the whole country may be bring back to a safe and unvarying standard a result vitally important as well to the interest as to the moral of the people there can surely now be no difference of opinion in regard to the incalculable evil that would have arise if the government at that critical moment have suffer to be deter from uphold the only true standard of value either by the pressure of adverse circumstance or the violence of unmerited denunciation the manner in which the people sustain the performance of this duty be highly honorable to fortitude and patriotism can not fail to stimulate agent to adhere under all circumstance to the line of duty and to satisfy of the safety with which a course really right and demand by a financial crisis may in a community like be pursue however apparently severe immediate operation the policy of the federal government in extinguish as rapidly as possible the national debt and subsequently in resist every temptation to create a new one deserve to be regard in the same favorable light among the many objection to a national debt the certain tendency of public security to concentrate ultimately in the coffer of foreign stockholder be which be every|day gathering strength already have the resource of many of the state and the future industry of citizen be indefinitely mortgage to the subject of european government to the amount of annually to pay the constantly accrue interest on borrow money a sum exceed half the ordinary revenue of the whole united|stat the pretext which this relation afford to foreigner to scrutinize the management of domestic affair if not actually to intermeddle with present a subject for earnest attention not to say of serious alarm fortunately the federal government with the exception of an obligation enter into in behalf of the|district|of|columbia which must soon be discharge be wholly exempt from any such embarrassment be also as be believe the only government which have fully and faithfully pay all creditor have also relieve entirely from debt to maintain a distinction so desirable and so honorable to national character should be an object of earnest solicitude never should a free people if be possible to avoid expose to the necessity of have to treat of the peace the honor or the safety of the republic with the government of foreign creditor who however well disposed may be to cultivate with in general friendly relation be nevertheless by the law of own condition make hostile to the success and permanency of political institution like our most humiliating may be the embarrassment consequent upon such a condition another objection scarcely less formidable to the commencement of a new debt be inevitable tendency to increase in magnitude and to foster national extravagance have be an unprofitable observer of event who need at this|day to be admonish of the difficulty which a government habitually dependent on loan to sustain ordinary expenditure have to encounter in resist the influence constantly exert in favor of additional loan by capitalist who enrich by government security for amount much exceed the money actually advance a prolific source of individual aggrandizement in all borrow country by stockholder who seek gain in the rise and fall of public stock and by the selfish importunity of applicant for appropriation for work avowedly for the accommodation of the public but the real object of which be too frequently the advancement of private interest the known necessity which so many of the state will be under to impose taxis for the payment of the interest on debt furnish an additional and very cogent reason why the federal government should refrain from create a national debt by which the people would be expose to double taxation for a similar object possess within ample resource for every emergency and may be quite sure that citizen in no future exigency will be unwilling to supply the government with all the mean ask for the defense of the country in time of peace there can at all event be no justification for the creation of a permanent debt by the federal government limited range of constitutional duty may certainly under such circumstance be perform without such a resort have be see be avoid during four|year of great fiscal difficulty than have exist in a similar period since the adoption of the constitution and one also remarkable for the occurrence of extraordinary cause of expenditure but to accomplish so desirable an object thing be indispensable first that the action of the federal government be keep within the boundary prescribe by founder and secondly that all appropriation for object admit to be constitutional and the expenditure of also be subject to a standard of rigid but well consider and practical economy the first depend chiefly on the people — the opinion form of the true construction of the constitution and the confidence repose in the political sentiment of those select as representative in the federal legislature the second rest upon the fidelity with which more immediate representative and other public functionary discharge the trust commit to the duty of economize the expense of the public service be admit on all hand yet there be few subject upon which there exist a wide difference of opinion than be constantly manifest in regard to the fidelity with which that duty be discharge neither diversity of sentiment nor even mutual recrimination upon a point in respect to which the public mind be so justly sensitive can well be entirely avoid and least so at period of great political excitement an intelligent people however seldom fail to arrive in the end at correct conclusion in such a matter practical economy in the management of public affair can have no adverse influence to contend with more powerful than a large surplus revenue and the unusually large appropriation for may without doubt independently of the extraordinary requisition for the public service grow out of the state of indian relation be in no inconsiderable degree trace to this source the sudden and rapid distribution of the large surplus then in the treasury and the equally sudden and unprecedentedly severe revulsion in the commerce and business of the country point with unerre certainty to a great and protracted reduction of the revenue strengthen the propriety of the early practicable reduction of the public expenditure but to change a system operate upon so large a surface and applicable to such numerous and diversified interest and object be more than the work of a|day the attention of every department of the government be immediately and in good faith direct to that end and have be so continue to the present moment the estimate and appropriation for the|year|1838 the first over which have any control be somewhat diminish the expenditure of be reduce those of exclusive of disbursement for public debt and trust claim will probably not exceed 22|1/2|million be between|two|and|three|million less than those of the|preceding|year and nine|or|10|million less than those of nor have be find necessary in order to produce this result to resort to the power confer by congress of postpone certain class of the public work except by defer expenditure for a short period upon a limited portion of and which postponement terminate some time since at the moment by further receipt from the indebte bank become fully assure of ability to meet without prejudice to the public service in other respect cause be in operation which will be believe justify a still further reduction without injury to any important national interest the expense of sustain the troop employ in florida have be gradually and greatly reduce through the persevere effort of the|war|department and a reasonable hope may be entertain that the necessity for military operation in that|quarter will soon cease the removal of the indians from within settle border be nearly complete the pension list of the heavy charge upon the treasury be rapidly diminish by death the most costly of public building be either finish or nearly so and may think safely promise a continued exemption from border difficulty the available balance in the treasury on the|1st|of|january next be estimate at this sum with the expect receipt from all source during the|next|year will be believe be sufficient to enable the government to meet every engagement and have a suitable balance in the treasury at the|end|of|the|year if the remedial measure connect with the custom and the public land heretofore recommend be adopt and the new appropriation by congress shall not carry the expenditure beyond the official estimate the new system establish by congress for the safe keeping of the public money prescribe the kind of currency to be receive for the public revenue and provide additional guard and security against loss have now be several mouth in operation although may be premature upon an experience of such limited duration to form a definite opinion in regard to the extent of influence in correct many evil under which the federal government and the country have hitherto suffer especially those that have grow out of banking expansion a depreciated currency and official defalcation yet be but right to say that nothing have occur in the practical operation of the system to weaken in the slight degree but much to strengthen the confident anticipation of friend the ground of these have be heretofore so fully explain as to require no recapitulation in respect to the facility and convenience afford in conduct the public service and the ability of the government to discharge through agency every duty attendant on the collection transfer and disbursement of the public money with promptitude and success can say with confidence tha the apprehension of those who feel to be duty to oppose adoption have prove to be unfounded on the contrary this branch of the fiscal affair of the government have be and be believe may always be thus carry on with every desirable facility and security a few change and improvement in the detail of the system without affect any principle involve in will be submit to by the secretary of the treasury and will be sure receive at hand that attention to which may on examination be find to be entitle have deem this brief summary of fiscal affair necessary to the due performance of a duty specially enjoin upon by the constitution will serve also to illustrate more fully the principle by which have be guide in reference to contest point in public policy which be early in development and have be more important in consequence than any that have arise under complicated and difficult yet admirable system of government allude to a national debt and a national bank be in these that the political contest by which the country have be agitate ever since the adoption of the constitution in a great measure originate and there be too much reason to apprehend that the conflict interest and oppose principle thus marshal will continue as heretofore to produce similar if not aggravate consequence come into office the declare enemy of both have earnestly endeavor to prevent a resort to either the consideration that a large public debt afford an apology and produce in some degree a necessity also for resort to a system and extent of taxation which be not only oppressive throughout but be likewise so apt to lead in the end to the commission of that most odious of all offense against the principle of republican government the prostitution of political power confer for the general benefit to the aggrandizement of particular class and the gratification of individual cupidity be alone sufficient independently of the weighty objection which have already be urge to render creation and existence the source of bitter and unappeasable discord if add to this inevitable tendency to produce and foster extravagant expenditure of the public money by which a necessity be create for new loan and new burden on the people and finally refer to the example of every government which have exist for proof how seldom be that the system when once adopt and implant in the policy of a country have fail to expand until public credit be exhaust and the people be no longer able to endure increase weight seem impossible to resist the conclusion that no benefit result from career no extent of conquest no accession of wealth to particular class nor any nor all combined advantage can counterbalance ultimate but certain result a splendid government and an impoverished people if a national bank be as be undeniable repudiate by the framer of the constitution as incompatible with the right of the state and the liberty of the people if from the beginning have be regard by large portion of citizen as come in direct collision with that great and vital amendment of the constitution which declare that all power not confer by that instrument on the general government be reserve to the state and to the people if have be view by as the first great step in the march of latitudinous construction which unchecke would render that sacred instrument of as little value as an unwritten constitution dependent as would alone be for meaning on the interested interpretation of a dominant party and afford no security to the right of the minority if such be undeniably the case what rational ground could have be conceive for anticipate aught but determine opposition to such an institution at the|present|day could a different result have be expect when the consequence which have flow from creation and particularly from struggle to perpetuate existence have confirm in so strike a manner the apprehension of early opponent when have be so clearly demonstrate that a concentrated money power wield so vast a capital and combine such incalculable mean of influence may in those peculiar conjuncture to which this government be unavoidably expose prove an overmatch for the political power of the people when the true character of capacity to regulate accord to will and interest and the interest of favorite the value and production of the labor and property of every man in this extended country have be so fully and fearfully develop when be notorious that all class of this great community have by mean of the power and influence thus possess be infect to madness with a spirit of heedless speculation when have be see that secure in the support of the combination of influence by which be surround could violate charter and set the law at defiance with impunity and when too have become most apparent that to believe that such an accumulation of power can ever be grant without the certainty of be abuse be to indulge in a fatal delusion to avoid the necessity of a permanent debt and inevitable consequence have advocate and endeavor to carry into effect the policy of confine the appropriation for the public service to such object only as be clearly within the constitutional authority of the federal government of exclude from expense those improvident and unauthorized grant of public money for work of internal improvement which be so wisely arrest by the constitutional interposition of predecessor and which if have not be so check would long before this time have involve the finance of the general government in embarrassment far great than those which be now experience by any of the state of limit all expenditure to that simple unostentatious and economical administration of public affair which be alone consistent with the character of institution of collect annually from the custom and the sale of public land a revenue fully adequate to defray all the expense thus incur but under no pretense whatsoever to impose taxis upon the people to a great amount than be actually necessary to the public service conduct upon the principle have state in lieu of a national bank or a dependence upon bank of any description for the management of fiscal affair recommend the adoption of the system which be now in successful operation that system afford every requisite facility for the transaction of the pecuniary concern of the government will be confidently anticipate produce in other respect many of the benefit which have be from time to time expect from the creation of a national bank but which have never be realize avoid the manifold evil inseparable from such an institution diminish to a great extent than could be accomplish by any other measure of reform the patronage of the federal government a wise policy in all government but more especially so in like our which work well only in proportion as be make to rely for support upon the unbiased and unadulterated opinion of constituent do away forever all dependence on corporate body either in the raising collect safekeeping or disburse the public revenue and place the government equally above the temptation of foster a dangerous and unconstitutional institution at home or the necessity of adapt policy to the view and interest of a still more formidable money power abroad be by adopt and carry out these principle under circumstance the most arduous and discourage that the attempt have be make thus far successfully to demonstrate to the people of the|united|state that a national bank at all time and a national debt except be incur at a period when the honor and safety of the nation demand the temporary sacrifice of a policy which should only be abandon in such exigency be not merely unnecessary but in direct and deadly hostility to the principle of government and to own permanent welfare the progress make in the development of these position appear in the precede sketch of the past history and present state of the financial concern of the federal government the fact there state fully authorize the assertion that all the purpose for which this government be institute have be accomplish during four|year of great pecuniary embarrassment than be ever before experience in time of peace and in the face of opposition as formidable as any that be ever before array against the policy of an administration that this have be do when the ordinary revenue of the government be generally decrease as well from the operation of the law as the condition of the country without the creation of a permanent public debt or incur any liability other than such as the ordinary resource of the government will speedily discharge and without the agency of a national bank if this view of the proceeding of the government for the period embrace be warrant by the fact as be know to exist if the army and navy have be sustain to the full extent authorize by law and which congress deem sufficient for the defense of the country and the protection of right and honor if civil and diplomatic service have be equally sustain if ample provision have be make for the administration of justice and the execution of the law if the claim upon public gratitude in behalf of the soldier of the revolution have be promptly meet and faithfully discharge if there have be no failure in defray the very large expenditure grow out of that long continue and salutary policy of peacefully remove the indians to region of comparative safety and prosperity if the public faith have at all time and everywhere be most scrupulously maintain by a prompt discharge of the numerous extend and diversify claim on the treasury if all these great and permanent object with many other that may be state have for a|series|of|years mark by peculiar obstacle and difficulty be successfully accomplish without a resort to a permanent debt or the aid of a national bank have not a right to expect that a policy the object of which have be to sustain the public service independently of either of these fruitful source of discord will receive the final sanction of a people whose unbiased and fairly elicit judgment upon public affair be never ultimately wrong that embarrassment in the pecuniary concern of individual of unexampled extent and duration have recently exist in this as in other commercial nation be undoubtedly true to suppose necessary now to trace these revers to source would be a reflection on the intelligence of fellow citizen whatever may have be the obscurity in which the subject be involve during the early stage of the revulsion there can not now be many by whom the whole question be not fully understand not deem within the constitutional power of the general government to repair private loss sustain by revers in business have no connection with the public service either by direct appropriation from the treasury or by special legislation design to secure exclusive privilege and immunity to individual or class in preference to or at the expense of the great majority necessarily debar from any participation in no attempt to do so have be either make recommend or encourage by the present executive be believe however that the great purpose for the attainment of which the federal government be institute have not be lose sight of intrust only with certain limited power cautiously enumerate distinctly specify and define with a precision and clearness which would seem to defy misconstruction have be constant aim to confine within the limit so clearly mark out and so carefully guard have always be of opinion that the good preservative of the union of the state be to be find in a total abstinence from the exercise of all doubtful power on the part of the federal government rather than in attempt to assume by a loose construction of the constitution or an ingenious perversion of word have endeavor to avoid recommend any measure which have reason to apprehend would in the opinion even of a considerable minority of fellow citizen be regard as trenching on the right of the state or the provision of the hallowed instrument of union view the aggregate power of the federal government as a voluntary concession of the state seem to that such only should be exercise as be at the time intend to be give have be strengthen too in the propriety of this course by the conviction that all effort to go beyond this tend only to produce dissatisfaction and distrust to excite jealousy and to provoke resistance instead of add strength to the federal government even when successful must ever prove a source of incurable weakness by alienate a portion of those whose adhesion be indispensable to the great aggregate of united strength and whose voluntary attachment be in estimation far more essential to the efficiency of a government strong in the good of all possible strength the confidence and attachment of all those who make up constituent element thus believe have be purpose to secure to the whole people and to every member of the confederacy by general salutary and equal law alone the benefit of those republican institution which be the end and aim of the constitution to establish and the impartial influence of which be in judgment indispensable to preservation can not bring to believe that the lasting happiness of the people the prosperity of the state or the permanency of union can be maintain by give preference or priority to any class of citizen in the distribution of benefit or privilege or by the adoption of measure which enrich portion of the union at the expense of another nor can see in the interference of the federal government with the local legislation and reserve right of the state a remedy for present or a security against future danger the first and assuredly not the least important step toward relieve the country from the condition into which have be plunge by excess in trade banking and credit of all kind be to place the business transaction of the government on a solid basis give and receive in all case value for value and neither countenance nor encourage in other that delusive system of credit from which have be find so difficult to escape and which have leave nothing behind but the wreck that mark fatal career that the financial affair of the government be now and have be during the whole period of these wide spread difficulty conduct with a strict and invariable regard to this great fundamental principle and that by the assumption and maintenance of the stand thus take on the very threshold of the approach crisis more than by any other cause or cause whatever the community at large have be shield from the incalculable evil of a general and indefinite suspension of specie payment and a consequent annihilation for the whole period may have last of a just and invariable standard of value will be believe at this period scarcely be question a steady adherence on the part of the government to the policy which have produce such salutary result aid by judicious state legislation and what be not less .important by the industry enterprise perseverance and economy of the american people can not fail to raise the whole country at an early period to a state of solid and endure prosperity not subject to be again overthrow by the suspension of bank or the explosion of a bloated credit system be for the people and representative to decide whether or not the permanent welfare of the country which all good citizen equally desire however widely may differ as to the mean of accomplishment shall be in this way secure or whether the management of the pecuniary concern of the government and by consequence to a great extent those of individual also shall be carry back to a condition of thing which foster those contraction and expansion of the currency and those reckless abuse of credit from the baleful effect of which the country have so deeply suffer a return that can promise in the end no well result than to reproduce the embarrassment the government have experience and to remove from the shoulder of the present to those of fresh victim the bitter fruit of that spirit of speculative enterprise to which countryman be so liable and upon which the lesson of experience be so unavailing the choice be an important one and sincerely hope that may be wisely make a report from the secretary of war present a detailed view of the affair of that department accompany this communication the desultory duty connect with the removal of the indians in which the army have be constantly engage on the northern and western frontier and in florida have render impracticable to carry into full effect the plan recommend by the secretary for improve discipline in every instance where the regiment have be concentrate have

cause beyond the control of the government experienced general have have the command of the troop officer and soldier have alike distinguish for activity patience and endure courage the army have be constantly furnish with supply of every description and must look for the cause which have so long procrastinate the issue of the contest in the vast extent of the theater of hostility the almost insurmountable obstacle present by the nature of the country the climate and the wily character of the savage the site for marine hospital on the river and lake which be authorize to select and cause to be purchase have all be designate but the appropriation not prove sufficient conditional arrangement only have be make for acquisition be for congress to decide whether these conditional purchase shall be sanction and the humane intention of the law carry into full effect the navy as will appear from the accompanying report of the secretary have be usefully and honorably employ in the

which be first see in latitude south longitude ' east and afterwards in latitude south longitude east by lieutenants|wilkes and hudson for an extent of but on which be prevent from land by vast body of ice which encompass be of the honorable result of the enterprise lieutenant wilkes bear testimony to the zeal and good conduct of officer and man and be but justice to that officer to state that appear to have perform the duty assign with an ardor ability and perseverance which give every assurance of an honorable issue to the undertaking the report of the postmaster general herewith transmit will exhibit the service of that department the|past|year and present condition the transportation have be maintain during the|year to the full extent authorize by the exist law some improvement have be effect which the public interest seem urgently to demand but not involve any material additional expenditure the contractor have generally perform engagement with fidelity the postmaster with few exception have render account and pay quarterly balance with promptitude and the whole service of the department have maintain the efficiency for which have for several|year be distinguish the act of congress establish new mail route and require more expensive service on other and the increase want of the country have for three|year past carry the expenditure something beyond the accrue revenue the excess have be meet until the|past|year by the surplus which have previously accumulate that surplus have be exhaust and the anticipate increase in the revenue not have be realize owe to the depression in the commercial business of the country the finance of the department exhibit a small deficiency at the close of the|last|fiscal|year resource however be ample and the reduce rate of compensation for the transportation service which may be expect on the future letting from the general reduction of price with the increase of revenue that may reasonably be anticipate from the revival of commercial activity must soon place the finance of the department in a prosperous condition consider the unfavorable circumstance which have exist during the|past|year be a gratifying result that the revenue have not decline as compare with the|preceding|year but on the contrary exhibit a small increase the circumstance refer to have have no other effect than to check the expected income will be see that the|postmaster|general suggest certain improvement in the establishment design to reduce the weight of the mail cheapen the transportation insure great regularity in the service and secure a considerable reduction in the rate of letter postage an object highly desirable the subject be of general interest to the community and be respectfully recommend to consideration the suppression of the african slave trade have receive the continued attention of the government the brig dolphin and schoon grampus have be employ during the|last|season on the coast of africa for the purpose of prevent such portion of that trade as be say to be prosecute under the american flag after cruise off those part of the coast most usually resort to by slaver until the commencement of the rainy season these vessel return to the|united|states for supply and have since be dispatch on a similar service from the report of the command officer appear that the trade be now principally carry on under portuguese color and express the opinion that the apprehension of presence on the slave coast have in a great degree arrest the prostitution of the american flag to this inhuman purpose be hope that by continue to maintain this force in that|quarter and by the exertion of the officer in command much will be do to put a stop to whatever portion of this traffic may have be carry on under the american flag and to prevent use in a trade which while violate the law be equally an outrage on the right of other and the feeling of humanity the effort of the several government who be anxiously seek to suppress this traffic must however be direct against the facility afford by what be now recognize as legitimate commercial pursuit before that object can be fully accomplish supply of provision water cask merchandise and article connect with the prosecution of the slave trade be be understand freely carry by vessel of different nation to the slave factory and the effect of the factor be transport openly from slave station to another without interruption or punishment by either of the nation to which belong engage in the commerce of that region submit to judgment whether this government have be the first to prohibit by adequate penalty the slave trade the first to declare piracy should not be the first also to forbid to citizen all trade with the slave factory on the coast of africa give an example to all nation in this respect which if fairly follow can not fail to produce the most effective result in break up those den of iniquity transcript fellow citizens of the senate and house|of|representatif regret that can not on this occasion congratulate that the|past|year have be of unalloyed prosperity the ravage of fire and disease have painfully afflict otherwise flourish portion of country and serious embarrassment yet derange the trade of many of city but notwithstanding these adverse circumstance that general prosperity which have be heretofore so bountifully bestow upon by the|author|of|all|good still continue to call for warm gratitude especially have reason to rejoice in the exuberant harvest which have lavishly recompense well direct industry and give to that sure reward which be vainly seek in visionary speculation can not indeed view without peculiar satisfaction the evidence afford by the|past|season of the benefit that spring from the steady devotion of the husbandman to honorable pursuit no mean of individual comfort be more certain and no source of national prosperity be so sure nothing can compensate a people for a dependence upon other for the bread eat and that cheerful abundance on which the happiness of everyone so much depend be to be look for nowhere with such sure reliance as in the industry of the agriculturist and the bounty of the earth with foreign country relation exhibit the same favorable aspect which be present in last annual message and afford continue proof of the wisdom of the pacific just and forbear policy adopt by the|first|administration|of|the|federal|government and pursue by successor the extraordinary power vest in by an act of congress for the defense of the country in an emergency consider so far probable as to require that the executive should possess ample mean to meet have not be exert have therefore be attend with no other result than to increase by the confidence thus repose in obligation to maintain with religious exactness the cardinal principle that govern intercourse with other nation happily in pende question with great|britain out of which this unusual grant of authority arise nothing have occur to require exertion and as be about to return to the legislature trust that no future necessity may call for exercise by or delegation to another|department|of|the|government for the settlement of northeastern boundary the proposition promise by great|britain for a commission of exploration and survey have be receive and a counter project include also a provision for the certain and final adjustment of the limit in dispute be now before the|british|government for consideration a just regard to the delicate state of this question and a proper respect for the natural impatience of the|state|of|maine not less than a conviction that the negotiation have be already protract longer than be prudent on the part of either government have lead to believe that the present favorable moment should on no account be suffer to pass without put the question forever at rest feel confident that the|government|of|her|britannic|majesty will take the same view of this subject as be persuade be govern by desire equally strong and sincere for the amicable termination of the controversy to the intrinsic difficulty of question of boundary line especially those describe in region unoccupied and but partially know be to be add in country the embarrassment necessarily arise out of constitution by which the|general|government be make the organ of negotiate and decide upon the particular interest of the states on whose frontier these line be to be trace to avoid another controversy in which a state government may rightfully claim to have wish consult previously to the conclusion of conventional arrangement concern right of jurisdiction or territory have think necessary to call the attention of the|government|of|great|britain to another portion of conterminous dominion of which the division still remain to be adjust refer to the line from the entrance of lake|superior to the most northwestern point of the|lake|of|the|wood stipulation for the settlement of which be to be find in the seventh article of the treaty of ghent the commissioner appoint under that article by the government have differ in opinion make separate report accord to stipulation upon the point of disagreement and these difference be now to be submit to the arbitration of some friendly sovereign or state the dispute point should be settle and the line designate before the territorial government of which be of the boundary take place in the union as a state and rely upon the cordial cooperation of the|british|government to effect that object there be every reason to believe that disturbance like those which lately agitate the neighboring british|province will not again prove the source of border contention or interpose obstacle to the continuance of that good understanding which be the mutual interest of great|britain and the|united|stat to preserve and maintain within the provinces tranquillity be restore and on frontier that misguide sympathy in favor of what be presume to be a general effort in behalf of popular right and which in some instance mislead a few of more inexperienced citizen have subside into a rational conviction strongly oppose to all intermeddle with the internal affair of neighbor the people of the|united|state feel as be hope always will a warm solicitude for the success of all who be sincerely endeavor to improve the political condition of mankind this generous feeling cherish toward the most distant nation and be natural therefore that should be awaken with more than common warmth in behalf of immediate neighbor but do not belong to character as a community to seek the gratification of those feeling in act which violate duty as citizen endanger the peace of country and tend to bring upon the stain of a violate faith toward foreign nation if zealous to confer benefit on other appear for a moment to lose sight of the permanent obligation impose upon as citizen be seldom long mislead from all the information receive confirm to some extent by personal observation be satisfied that no one can now hope to engage in such enterprise without encounter public indignation in addition to the severest penalty of the law recent information also lead to hope that the emigrant from majesty 's province who have seek refuge within boundary be dispose to become peaceable resident and to abstain from all attempt to endanger the peace of that country which have afford an asylum on a review of the occurrence on both side of the line be satisfactory to reflect that in almost every complaint against country the offense may be trace to emigrant from the province who have seek refuge here in the few instance in which be aid by citizen of the|united|state the act of these misguided man be not only in direct contravention of the law and well know wish of own government but meet with the decided disapprobation of the people of the|united|state regret to state the appearance of a different spirit among majesty 's subject in the canadas the sentiment of hostility to people and institution which have be so frequently express there and the disregard of right which have be manifest on some occasion have be sorry to say be applaud and encourage by the people and even by some of the subordinate local authority of the provinces the chief officer in canada fortunately have not entertain the same feeling and have probably prevent excess that must have be fatal to the peace of the country look forward anxiously to a period when all the transaction which have grow out of this condition of affair and which have be make the subject of complaint and remonstrance by the government respectively shall be fully examine and the proper satisfaction give where be due from either side nothing have occur to disturb the harmony of intercourse with austria belgium denmark france naples portugal prussia russia or sweden the internal state of spain have sensibly improve and a well ground hope exist that the return of peace will restore to the people of that country former prosperity and enable the government to fulfill all obligation at home and abroad the|government|of|portugal have the satisfaction to state have pay in full the eleventh and last installment due to citizen for the claim embrace in the settlement make with on the|3d|of march lay before treaty of commerce negotiate with the king of sardinia and of the netherlands the ratification of which have be exchange since the adjournment of congress the liberal principle of these treaty will recommend to approbation that with sardinia be the first treaty of commerce form by that kingdom and will trust answer the expectation of the present sovereign by aid the development of the resource of country and stimulate the enterprise of people that with the netherlands happily terminate a long exist subject of dispute and remove from future commercial intercourse all apprehension of embarrassment the|king|of|the|netherland have also in further illustration of character for justice and of desire to remove every cause of dissatisfaction make compensation for an american vessel capture in by a french privateer and carry into curacoa where the proceed be appropriate to the use of the colony then and for a short time after under the dominion of holland the death of the late sultan have produce no alteration in relation with turkey newly appoint minister resident have reach constantinople and have receive assurance from the present ruler that the obligation of treaty and those of friendship will be fulfil by in the same spirit that actuate illustrious father regret to be oblige to inform that no convention for the settlement of the claim of citizen upon mexico have yet be ratify by the government of that country the first convention form for that purpose be not present by the president of mexico for the approbation of congress from a belief that the|king|of|prussia the arbitrator in case of disagreement in the joint commission to be appoint by the|united|state and mexico would not consent to take upon that friendly office although not entirely satisfied with the course pursue by mexico feel no hesitation in receive in the most conciliatory spirit the explanation offer and also cheerfully consent to a new convention in order to arrange the payment propose to be make to citizen in a manner which while equally just to be deem less onerous and inconvenient to the|mexican|government rely confidently upon the intention of that government mr. ellis be direct to repair to mexico and diplomatic intercourse have be resume between the country the new convention have inform be recently submit by the president of that republic to congress under circumstance which promise a speedy ratification a result which can not allow to doubt instruction have be give to the commissioner of the|united|state under convention with texas for the demarcation of the line which separate from that republic the commissioner of both government meet in new|orleans in august last the joint commission be organize and adjourn to convene at the same place on the|12th|of|october be presume to be now in the performance of duty the new government|of|texas have show desire to cultivate friendly relation with by a prompt reparation for injury complain of in the case of vessel of the|united|state with central|america a convention have be conclude for the renewal of former treaty with the|united|state this be not ratify before the departure of late charge d'affaires from that country and the copy of bring by be not receive before the adjournment of the senate at the last session in the meanwhile the period limit for the exchange of ratification have expire deem expedient in consequence of the death of the charge d'affaires to send a special agent to central|america to close the affair of mission there and to arrange with the government an extension of the time for the exchange of ratification the commission create by the states which formerly compose the|republic|of|colombia for adjust the claim against that government have by a very unexpected construction of the treaty under which act decide that no provision be make for those claim of citizen of the|united|state which arise from capture by colombian privateer and be adjudge against the claimant in the judicial tribunal this decision will compel the|united|state to apply to the several government formerly unite for redress with all these new|granada venezuela and ecuador a perfectly good understanding exist treaty with venezuela be faithfully carry into execution and that country in the enjoyment of tranquillity be gradually advance in prosperity under the guidance of present distinguish president general paez with ecuador a liberal commercial convention have lately be conclude which will be transmit to the senate at an|early|day with the great american|empire|of|brazil relation continue unchanged as do friendly intercourse with the other government of south america the|argentine|republic and the|republics|of|uruguay chili peru and bolivia the dissolution of the|peru bolivian|confederation may occasion some temporary inconvenience to citizen in that|quarter but the obligation on the new government which have arise out of that confederation to observe treaty stipulation will no doubt be soon understand and be presume that no indisposition will exist to fulfill those which contract with the|united|state the financial operation of the government during the|present|year have be happy to say be very successful the difficulty under which the|treasury|department have labor from know defect in the exist law relative to the safe keeping of the public money aggravate by the suspension of specie payment by several of the bank hold public deposit or indebte to public officer for note receive in payment of public due have be surmount to a very gratifying extent the large current expenditure have be punctually meet and the faith of the government in all pecuniary concern have be scrupulously maintain the million of treasury note authorize by the act of congress of and the modification thereof with a view to the indulgence of merchant on duty bond and of the deposit bank in the payment of public money hold by have be so punctually redeem as to leave less than the original ten|million outstanding at any time and the whole amount unredeeme now fall short of three|million of these the chief portion be not due till next|year and the whole would have be already extinguish could the treasury have realize the payment due to from the bank if those due from during the|next|year shall be punctually make and if congress shall keep the appropriation within the estimate there be every reason to believe that all the outstanding treasury note can be redeem and the ordinary expense defray without impose on the people any additional burden either of loan or increase taxis to avoid this and to keep the expenditure within reasonable bound be a duty second only in importance to the preservation of national character and the protection of citizen in civil and political right the creation in time of peace of a debt likely to become permanent be an evil for which there be no equivalent the rapidity with which many of the states be apparently approach to this condition admonish of own duty in a manner too impressive to be disregard not the least important be to keep the|federal|government always in a condition to discharge with ease and vigor high function should exercise be require by any sudden conjuncture of public affair a condition to which be always expose and which may occur when be least expect to this end be indispensable that finance should be untrammele and resource as far as practicable unencumbered no circumstance could present great obstacle to the accomplishment of these vitally important object than the creation of an onerous national debt own experience and also that of other nation have demonstrate the unavoidable and fearful rapidity with which a public debt be increase when the government have once surrender to the ruinous practice of supply suppose necessity by new loan the struggle therefore on part to be successful must be make at the threshold to make effort effective severe economy be necessary this be the sure provision for the national welfare and be at the same time the good preservative of the principle on which institution rest simplicity and economy in the affair of state have never fail to chasten and invigorate republican principle while these have be as surely subvert by national prodigality under whatever specious pretext may have be introduce or foster these consideration can not be lose upon a people who have never be inattentive to the effect of policy upon the institution have create for but at the present moment force be augment by the necessity which a decrease revenue must impose the check lately give to importation of article subject to duty the derangement in the operation of internal trade and especially the reduction gradually take place in tariff of duty all tend materially to lessen receipt indeed be probable that the diminution result from the last cause alone will not fall short of in the|year|1842 as the final reduction of all duty to then take effect the whole revenue then accrue from the custom and from the sale of public land if not more will undoubtedly be want to defray the necessary expense of the government under the most prudent administration of affair these be circumstance that impose the necessity of rigid economy and require prompt and constant exercise with the legislature rest the power and duty of so adjust the public expenditure as to promote this end by the provision of the constitution be only in consequence of appropriation make by law that money can be draw from the treasury no instance have occur since the establishment of the government in which the executive though a component part of the legislative power have interpose an objection to an appropriation bill on the sole ground of extravagance duty in this respect have be consider fulfil by request such appropriation only as the public service may be reasonably expect to require in the present earnest direction of the public mind toward this subject both the executive and the legislature have evidence of the strict responsibility to which will be hold and while be conscious of own anxious effort to perform with fidelity this portion of public function be a satisfaction to to be able to count on a cordial cooperation from at the time enter upon present duty ordinary disbursement without include those on account of the public debt the|post office and the trust fund in charge of the government have be largely increase by appropriation for the removal of the indians for repel indian hostility and for other less urgent expense which grow out of an overflowing treasury independent of the redemption of the public debt and trust the gross expenditure of seventeen|and|eighteen|millions|in and have by these cause swell to nine|million in and the appropriation for make previously to the 4th of march cause the expenditure to rise to the very large amount of three|million be enable during the|year|1838 notwithstanding the continuance of indian embarrassment somewhat to reduce this amount and that for the|present|year|(1839 will not in all probability exceed six|million or six|million less than be last|year with a determination so far as depend on to continue this reduction have direct the estimate for to be subject to the severest scrutiny and to be limit to the absolute requirement of the public service will be find less than the expenditure of by over|$5,000,000 the precautionary measure which will be recommend by the secretary of the treasury to protect faithfully the public credit under the fluctuation and contingency to which receipt and expenditure be expose and especially in a commercial crisis like the present be commend to early attention on a former occasion attention be invite to various consideration in support of a preemption law in behalf of the settler on the public land and also of a law graduate the price for such land as have long be in the market unsold in consequence of inferior quality the execution of the act which be pass on the first subject have be attend with the happy consequence in quiet title and secure improvement to the industrious and have also to a very gratifying extent be exempt from the fraud which be practice under previous preemption law have at the same time as be anticipate contribute liberally during the|present|year to the receipt of the treasury the passage of a graduation law with the guard before recommend would also be persuade add considerably to the revenue for several|year and prove in other respect just and beneficial early consideration of the subject be therefore once more earnestly request the present condition of the defense of principal seaport and navy yard as represent by the accompanying report of the secretary of war call for the early and serious attention of congress and as connect intimately with this subject can not recommend too strongly to consideration the plan submit by that officer for the organization of the militia of the|united|state in conformity with the express wish of congress an attempt be make in the|spre to terminate the florida war by negotiation be to be regret that these humane intention should have be frustrate and that the effort to bring these unhappy difficulty to a satisfactory conclusion should have fail but after enter into solemn engagement with the commanding general the indians without any provocation recommence act of treachery and murder the renewal of hostility in that territory render necessary that should recommend to favorable consideration the plan which will be submit to by the secretary of war in order to enable that department to conduct to a successful issue have have an opportunity of personally inspect a portion of the troop during the|last|summer give pleasure to bear testimony to the success of the effort to improve discipline by keep together in as large body as the nature of service will permit recommend therefore that commodious and permanent barrack be construct at the several post designate by the secretary of war notwithstanding the high state of discipline and excellent police the evil result to the service from the deficiency of company officer be very apparent and recommend that the staff officer be permanently separate from the line the navy have be usefully and honorably employ in protect the right and property of citizen wherever the condition of affair seem to require presence with the exception of instance where an outrage accompany by murder be commit on a vessel of the|united|state while engage in a lawful commerce nothing be know to have occur to impede or mol the enterprise of citizen on that element where be so signally display on learn this daring act of piracy commodore|reed proceed immediately to the spot and receive no satisfaction either in the surrender of the murderer or the restoration of the plunder property inflict severe and merit chastisement on the barbarian will be see by the report of the secretary of the navy respect the disposition of ship of war that have be deem necessary to station a competent force on the coast of africa to prevent a fraudulent use of flag by foreigner recent experience have show that the provision in exist law which relate to the sale and transfer of american vessel while abroad be extremely defective advantage have be take of these defect to give to vessel wholly belong to foreigner and navigate the ocean an apparent american ownership this character have be so well simulate as to afford comparative security in prosecute the slave trade a traffic emphatically denounce in statute regard with abhorrence by citizen and of which the effectual suppression be nowhere more sincerely desire than in the|united|state these circumstance make proper to recommend to early attention a careful revision of these law so that without impede the freedom and facility of navigation or impair an important branch of industry connect with the integrity and honor of flag may be carefully preserve information derive from consul at havana show the necessity of this be communicate to a committee of the senate near the close of the last session but too late as appear to be act upon will be bring to notice by the proper department with additional communication from other source the late account from the explore expedition represent as proceed successfully in object and promising result no less useful to trade and navigation than to science the extent of post - road cover by mail service on the|1st|of|july|last be about|133,999|miles and the rate of annual transportation upon the number of post - office on that|day be and on the 30th ultimo the revenue of the|post office|department for the|year|ending|with|the|30th|of|june|last be exhibit an increase over the|preceding|year of the engagement and liability of the department for the same period be the excess of liability over the revenue for the|last|two|year have be meet out of the surplus which have previously accumulate the cash on hand on the 30th ultimo be about|$206,701.95 and the current income of the department vary very little from the rate of current expenditure most of the service suspend last|year have be restore and most of the new route establish by have be set in operation at an annual cost of notwithstanding the pecuniary difficulty of the country the revenue of the department appear to be increase and unless shall be seriously check by the recent suspension of payment by so many of the bank will be able not only to maintain the present mail service but in a short time to extend be gratify to witness the promptitude and fidelity with which the agent of this department in general perform public duty some difficulty have arise in relation to contract for the transportation of the mail by railroad and steamboat company appear that the maximum of compensation provide by congress for the transportation of the mail upon railroad be not sufficient to induce some of the company to convey at such|hours as be require for the accommodation of the public be of the most important duty of the|general|government to provide and maintain for the use of the people of the states the good practicable mail establishment to arrive at that end be indispensable that the|post office|department shall be enable to control the|hour at which the mail shall be carry over railroad as now do over all other road should serious inconvenience arise from the inadequacy of the compensation now provide by law or from unreasonable demand by any of the railroad company the subject be of such general importance as to require the prompt attention of congress in relation to steamboat line the most efficient remedy be obvious and have be suggest by the|postmaster general the|war|and navy departments already employ steamboat in service and although be by no mean desirable that the government should undertake the transportation of passenger or freight as a business there can be no reasonable objection to run boat temporarily whenever may be necessary to put down attempt at extortion to be discontinue as soon as reasonable contract can be obtain the suggestion of the postmaster general relative to the inadequacy of the legal allowance to witness in case of prosecution for mail depredation merit serious consideration the safety of the mail require that such prosecution shall be efficient and justice to the citizen whose time be require to be give to the public demand not only that expense shall be pay but that shall receive a reasonable compensation the report from the|war navy and post office|departments will accompany this communication and from the|treasury|department will be present to congress in a|few|day for various detail in respect to the matter in charge of these departments would refer to those important document satisfy that will find in many valuable suggestion which will be find well deserve the attention of the legislature from a report make in december|of|last|year by the secretary of state to the senate show the trial docket of each of the circuit court and the number of mile each judge have to travel in the performance of duty a great inequality appear in the amount of labor assign to each judge the number of term to be hold in each of the court compose the ninth circuit the distance between the place at which sit and from thence to the seat of government be represent to be such as to render impossible for the judge of that circuit to perform in a manner correspond with the public exigencie term and circuit duty a revision therefore of the present arrangement of the circuit seem to be call for and be recommend to notice think proper to call attention to the power assume by territorial legislature to authorize the issue of bond by corporate company on the guaranty of the territory congress pass a law in provide that no act of a territorial legislature incorporate bank should have the force of law until approve by congress but act of a very exceptionable character previously pass by the legislature of florida be suffer to remain in force by virtue of which bond may be issue to a very large amount by those institution upon the faith of the territory a resolution intend to be a joint one pass the senate at the same session express the sense of congress that the law in question ought not to be permit to remain in force unless amend in many material respect but fail in the|house|of|representatives for want of time and the desire amendment have not be make the interest involve be of great importance and the subject deserve early and careful attention the continued agitation of the question relative to the good mode of keep and disburse the public money still injuriously affect the business of the country the suspension of specie payment in render the use of deposit bank as prescribe by the act of a source rather of embarrassment than aid and of necessity place the custody of most of the public money afterwards collect in charge of the public officer the new security for safety which this require be a principal cause of convene an extra session of congress but in consequence of a disagreement between the houses neither then nor at any subsequent period have there be any legislation on the subject the effort make at the last session to obtain the authority of congress to punish the use of public money for private purpose as a crime a measure attend under other government with signal advantage be also unsuccessful from diversity of opinion in that body notwithstanding the anxiety doubtless feel by to afford every practicable security the result of this be still to leave the custody of the public money without those safeguard which have be for several|year earnestly desire by the executive and as the remedy be only to be find in the action of the legislature impose on the duty of again submit to the propriety of pass a law provide for the safe keeping of the public money and especially to ask that use for private purpose by any officer intrust with may be declare to be a felony punishable with penalty proportion to the magnitude of the offense these circumstance add to know defect in the exist law and unusual derangement in the general operation of trade have during much increase the difficulty attendant on the collection keep and disbursement of the revenue and call forth corresponding exertion from those have in charge happily these have be successful beyond expectation vast sum have be collect and disburse by the several departments with unexpected cheapness and ease transfer have be readily make to every part of the union however distant and defalcation have be far less than may have be anticipate from the absence of adequate legal restraint since the officer of the treasury and post office|departments be charge with the custody of most of the public money receive by there have be collect and exclude the case of the late collector at new|york the aggregate amount of loss sustain in the collection can not be believe exceed the defalcation of the late collector at that city of the extent and circumstance of which congress have be fully inform run through all the mode of keep the public money that have be hitherto in use and be distinguish by an aggravated disregard of duty that break through the restraint of every system and can not therefore be usefully refer to as a test of the comparative safety of either additional information will also be furnish by the report of the secretary of the treasury in reply to a call make upon that officer by the|house|of|representatives at the last session require detailed information on the subject of default by public officer or agent under each administration from to this document will be submit to in a|few|day the general result independent of the|post office which be keep separately and will be state by so far as bear upon this subject be that the loss which have be and be likely to be sustain by any class of agent have be the great by bank include as require in the resolution depreciated paper receive for public due that the next large have be by disburse officer and the least by collector and receiver if the loss on duty bond be include alone will be threefold those by both collector and receiver whole experience therefore furnish the strong evidence that the desire legislation of congress be alone want to insure in those operation the high degree of security and facility such also appear to have be the experience of other nation from the result of inquiry make by the secretary of the treasury in regard to the practice among be enable to state that in out of foreign government from which undoubted information have be obtain the public money be keep in charge of public officer this concurrence of opinion in favor of that system be perhaps as great as exist on any question of internal administration in the mode of business and official restraint on disburse officer no legal change be produce by the suspension of specie payment the report last refer to will be find to contain also much useful information in relation to this subject have heretofore assign to congress reason for believe that the establishment of an independent national|treasury as contemplate by the constitution be necessary to the safe action of the|federal|government the suspension of specie payment in by the bank have the custody of the public money show in so alarm a degree dependence on those institution for the performance of duty require by law that then recommend the entire dissolution of that connection this recommendation have be subject as desire should be to severe scrutiny and animate discussion and allow to believe that notwithstanding the natural diversity of opinion which may be anticipate on all subject involve such important consideration have secure in favor as general a concurrence of public sentiment as could be expect on of such magnitude recent event have also continue to develop new objection to such a connection seldom be any bank under the exist system and practice able to meet on demand all liability for deposit and note in circulation maintain specie payment and transact a profitable business only by the confidence of the public in solvency and whenever this be destroy the demand of depositor and note holder press more rapidly than can make collection from debtor force to stop payment this loss of confidence with consequence occur in and afford the apology of the bank for suspension the public then acquiesce in the validity of the excuse and while the state legislature do not exact from forfeited charter congress in accordance with the recommendation of the executive allow time to pay over the public money hold although compel to issue treasury note to supply the deficiency thus create now appear that there be other motif than a want of public confidence under which the bank seek to justify in a refusal to meet obligation scarcely be the country and government relieve in a degree from the difficulty occasion by the general suspension of when a partial occur within thirty|month of the former produce new and serious embarrassment though have no palliation in such circumstance as be allege in justification of that which have previously take place there be nothing in the condition of the country to endanger a well manage banking institution commerce be derange by no foreign war every branch of manufacturing industry be crown with rich reward and the more than usual abundance of harvest after supply domestic want have leave granary and storehouse fill with a surplus for exportation be in the midst of this that an irredeemable and depreciated paper currency be entail upon the people by a large portion of the bank be not drive to by the exhibition of a loss of public confidence or of a sudden pressure from depositor or note holder but excuse by allege that the current of business and exchange with foreign country which draw the precious metal from vault would require in order to meet a large curtailment of loan to a comparatively small portion of the community than will be convenient for to bear or perhaps safe for the bank to exact the plea have cease to be of necessity convenience and policy be now deem sufficient to warrant these institution in disregard solemn obligation such conduct be not merely an injury to individual creditor but be a wrong to the whole community from whose liberality hold most valuable privilege whose right violate whose business derange and the value of whose property render unstable and insecure must be evident that this new ground for bank suspension in reference to which action be not only disconnect with but wholly independent of that of the public give a character to suspension more alarming than any which exhibit before and greatly increase the impropriety of rely on the bank in the transaction of the government a large and highly respectable portion of banking institution be afford unfeigned pleasure to state exempt from all blame on account of this second delinquency have to great credit not only continue to meet engagement but have even repudiate the ground of suspension now resort to be only by such a course that the confidence and good will of the community can be preserve and in the sequel the good interest of the institution promote new danger to the bank be also daily disclose from the extension of that system of extravagant credit of which be the pillar formerly foreign commerce be principally round on an exchange of commodity include the precious metal and leave in transaction but little foreign debt such be not now the case aid by the facility afford by the bank mere credit have become too commonly the basis of trade many of the bank not content with largely stimulate this system among other have usurp the business while impair the stability of the mercantile community have become borrower instead of lender establish agency abroad deal largely in stock and merchandise encourage the issue of state security until the foreign market be glut with and unsatisfie with the legitimate use of own capital and the exercise of lawful privilege raise by large loan additional mean for every variety of speculation the disaster attendant on this deviation from the former course of business in this country be now share alike by bank and individual to an extent of which there be perhaps no previous example in the annal of country so long as a willingness of the foreign lender and a sufficient export of production to meet any necessary partial payment leave the flow of credit undisturbed all appear to be prosperous but as soon as be check by any hesitation abroad or by an inability to make payment there in production the evil of the system be disclose the paper currency which may serve for domestic purpose be useless to pay the debt due in europe gold and silver be therefore draw in exchange for note from the bank to keep up supply of coin these institution be oblige to call upon own debtor who pay principally in own note which be as unavailable to as be to the merchant to meet the foreign demand the call of the bank therefore in such emergency of necessity exceed that demand and produce a corresponding curtailment of accommodation and of the currency at the very moment when the state of trade render most inconvenient to be bear the intensity of this pressure on the community be in proportion to the previous liberality of credit and consequent expansion of the currency force sale of property be make at the time when the mean of purchasing be most reduced and the bad calamity to individual be only at last arrest by an open violation of obligation by the bank a refusal to pay specie for note and an imposition upon the community of a fluctuating and depreciated currency these consequence be inherent in the present system be not influence by the bank be large or small create by national or state governments be the result of the irresistible law of trade or credit in the recent event which have so strikingly illustrate the certain effect of these law have see the bank of the large capital in the union establish under a national charter and lately strengthen as be authoritatively inform by exchange that for a state charter with new and unusual privilege in a condition too as be say of entire soundness and great prosperity not merely unable to resist these effect but the first to yield to nor be to be overlook that there exist a chain of necessary dependence among these institution which oblige to a great extent to follow the course of other notwithstanding injustice to own immediate creditor or injury to the particular community in which be place this dependence of a bank which be in proportion to the extent of debt for circulation and deposit be not merely on other in own vicinity but on all those which connect with the center of trade distant bank may fail without seriously affect those in principal commercial city but the failure of the latter be feel at the extremity of the union the suspension at new|york in be everywhere with very few exception follow as soon as be know that recently at philadelphia immediately affect the bank of the south and west in a similar manner this dependence of whole banking system on the institution in a few large city be not find in the law of organization but in those of trade and exchange the bank at that center to which currency flow and where be require in payment for merchandise hold the power of control those in region whence come while the latter possess no means of restrain so that the value of individual property and the prosperity of trade through the whole interior of the country be make to depend on the good or bad management of the banking institution in the great seat of trade on the seaboard but this chain of dependence do not stop here do not terminate at philadelphia or new|york reach across the ocean and end in london the center of the credit system the same law of trade which give to the bank in principal city power over the whole banking system of the|united|state subject the former in turn to the money power in great|britain be not deny that the suspension of the new|york bank in which be follow in quick succession throughout the union be produce by an application of that power and be now allege in extenuation of the present condition of so large a portion of bank that embarrassment have arise from the same cause from this influence can not now entirely escape for have origin in the credit currency of the country be strengthen by the current of trade and exchange which center in london and be render almost irresistible by the large debt contract there by merchant bank and state be thus that an introduction of a new bank into the most distant of village place the business of that village within the influence of the money power in england be thus that every new debt which contract in that country seriously affect own currency and extend over the pursuit of citizen powerful influence can not escape from this by make new bank great or small state or national the same chain which bind those now exist to the center of this system of paper credit must equally fetter every similar institution create be only by the extent to which this system have be push of late that have be make fully aware of irresistible tendency to subject own bank and currency to a vast control power in a foreign lad and add a new argument to those which illustrate precarious situation endanger in the first place by own mismanagement and again by the conduct of every institution which connect with the center of trade in own country be yet subject beyond all this to the effect of whatever measure policy necessity or caprice may induce those who control the credit of england to resort to mean not to comment upon these measure present or past and much less to discourage the prosecution of fair commercial dealing between the country base on reciprocal benefit but have now be make manifest that the power of inflict these and similar injury be by the resistless law of a credit currency and credit trade equally capable of extend consequence through all the ramification of banking system and by that mean indirectly obtain particularly when bank be use as depository of the public money a dangerous political influence in the|united|state have deem duty to bring the subject to notice and ask for serious consideration be an argument require beyond the exposition of these fact to show the impropriety of use banking institution as depository of the public money can venture not only to encounter the risk of individual and mutual mismanagement but at the same time to place foreign and domestic policy entirely under the control of a foreign moneyed interest to do so be to impair the independence of government as the present credit system have already impair the independence of bank be to submit all important operation whether of peace or war to be control or thwart at first by own bank and then by a power abroad great than can not bring to depict the humiliation to which this government and people may be sooner or later reduce if the mean for defend right be to be make dependent upon those who may have the most powerful of motif to impair nor be only in reference to the effect of this state of thing on the independence of government or of bank that the subject present for consideration be to be view also in relation to the general trade of country the time be not long pass when a deficiency of foreign crop be think to afford a profitable market for the surplus of industry but now await with feverish anxiety the news of the english harvest not so much from motif of commendable sympathy but fearful lest anticipated failure should narrow the field of credit there do not this speak volume to the patriot can a system be beneficent wise or just which create great anxiety for interest dependent on foreign credit than for the general prosperity of own country and the profitable exportation of the surplus produce of labor the circumstance to which have thus advert appear to to afford weighty reason develop by late event to be add to those which have on former occasion offer when submit to well knowledge and discernment the propriety of separate the custody of the public money from banking institution nor have anything occur to lessen in opinion the force of what have be heretofore urge the only ground on which that custody can be desire by the bank be the profitable use which may make of the money such use would be regard in individual as a breach of trust or a crime of great magnitude and yet may be reasonably doubt whether first and last be not attend with more mischievous consequence when permit to the former than to the latter the practice of permit the public money to be use by keeper as here be believe to be peculiar to this country and to exist scarcely anywhere else to procure here improper influence be appeal to unwise connection be establish between the government and vast number of powerful state institution other motif than the public good be bring to bear both on the executive and legislative department and selfish combination lead to special legislation be form be make the interest of banking institution and stockholder throughout the union to use exertion for the increase of taxation and the accumulation of a surplus revenue and while an excuse be afford the mean be furnish for those excessive issue which lead to extravagant trading and speculation and be the forerunner of a vast debt abroad and a suspension of the bank at home impressed therefore as be with the propriety of the fund of the government be withdraw from the private use of either bank or individual and the public money keep by duly appoint public agent and believe as do that such also be the judgment which discussion reflection and experience have produce on the public mind leave the subject with be at all event essential to the interest of the community and the business of the government that a decision should be make most of the argument that dissuade from employ bank in the custody and disbursement of the public money apply with equal force to the receipt of note for public due the difference be only in form in instance the government be a creditor for deposit and in the other for the note hold afford the same opportunity for use the public money and equally lead to all the evil attendant upon since a bank can as safely extend discount on a deposit of note in the hand of a public officer as on make in own vault on the other hand would give to the government no great security for in case of failure the claim of the note holder would be no well than that of a depositor be aware that the danger of inconvenience to the public and unreasonable pressure upon sound bank have be urge as objection to require the payment of the revenue in gold and silver these objection have be greatly exaggerate from the good estimate may safely fix the amount of specie in the country at and the portion of that which would be employ at any time in the receipt and disbursement of the government even if the propose change be make at once would not be now after full investigation believe exceed four|or|five|million if the change be gradual several|year would elapse before that sum would be require with annual opportunity in the meantime to alter the law should experience prove to be oppressive or inconvenient the portion of the community on whose business the change would immediately operate be comparatively small nor be believe that effect would be in the least unjust or injurious to in the payment of duty which constitute by far the great portion of the revenue a very large proportion be derive from foreign commission house and agent of foreign manufacturer who sell the good consign to generally at auction and after pay the duty out of the avail remit the rest abroad in specie or equivalent that the amount of duty should in such case be also retain in specie can hardly be make a matter of complaint own import merchant by whom the residue of the duty be pay be not only peculiarly interested in maintain a sound currency which the measure in question will especially promote but be from the nature of dealing best able to know when specie will be need and to procure with the least difficulty or sacrifice reside too almost universally in place where the revenue be receive and where the draft use by the government for disbursement must concentrate have every opportunity to obtain and use in place of specie should be for interest or convenience of the number of these draft and the facility may afford as well as of the rapidity with which the public fund be draw and disburse an idea may be form from the fact that of nearly|$20,000,000 pay to collector and receiver during the|present|year the average amount in hand at any time have not exceed a|million|and|a|half and of the fifteen|million receive by the collector of new|york alone during the|present|year the average amount hold by subject to draft during each|week have be less|than|half|a|million the ease and safety of the operation of the treasury in keep the public money be promote by the application of own draft to the public due the objection arise from have too long outstanding may be obviate and yet make to afford to merchant and bank hold an equivalent for specie and in that way greatly lessen the amount actually require still less inconvenience will attend the requirement of specie in purchase of public land such purchase except when make on speculation be in general but single transaction rarely repeat by the same person and be a fact that for during which the note of sound bank have be receive more than a moiety of these payment have be voluntarily make in specie be a large proportion than would have be require in three|years under the graduation propose be moreover a principle than which none be better settle by experience that the supply of the precious metal will always be find adequate to the us for which be require abound in country where no other currency be allow in own states where small note be exclude gold and silver supply place when drive to hiding place by bank suspension a little firmness in the community soon restore in a sufficient quantity for ordinary purpose postage and other public due have be collect in coin without serious inconvenience even in states where a depreciated paper currency have exist for year and this with the aid of treasury note for a part of the time be do without interruption during the suspension of at the present moment the receipt and disbursement of the government be make in legal currency in the large portion of the union no one suggest a departure from this rule and if can now be successfully carry out will be surely attend with even less difficulty when bank note be again redeem in specie indeed can not think that a serious objection would anywhere be raise to the receipt and payment of gold and silver in all public transaction be not from an apprehension that a surplus in the treasury may withdraw a large portion of from circulation and lock up unprofitably in the public vault would not in opinion be difficult to prevent such an inconvenience from occur but the authentic statement which have already submit to in regard to the actual amount in the public treasury at any time during the period embrace in and the little probability of a different state of the treasury for at|least|some|years to come seem to render unnecessary to dwell upon congress moreover as have before observed will in every|year have an opportunity to guard against should the occurrence of any circumstance lead to apprehend injury from this source view the subject in all aspect can not believe that any period will be more auspicious than the present for the adoption of all measure necessary to maintain the sanctity of own engagement and to aid in secure to the community that abundant supply of the precious metal which add so much to prosperity and give such increase stability to all dealing in a country so commercial as ours bank in some form will probably always exist but this serve only to render the more incumbent on notwithstanding the discouragement of the past to strive in respective station to mitigate the evil produce to take from as rapidly as the obligation of public faith and a careful consideration of the immediate interest of the community will permit the unjust character of monopoly to check so far as may be practicable by prudent legislation those temptation of interest and those opportunity for dangerous indulgence which beset on every side and to confine strictly to the performance of paramount duty that of aid the operation of commerce rather than consult own exclusive advantage these and other salutary reform may be believe be accomplish without the violation of any of the great principle of the social compact the observance of which be indispensable to existence or interfere in any way with the useful and profitable employment of real capital institution so frame have exist and still exist elsewhere give to commercial intercourse all necessary facility without inflate or depreciate the currency or stimulate speculation thus accomplish legitimate end have gain the sure guaranty for protection and encouragement in the good will of the community among a people so just as the same result could not fail to attend a similar course the direct supervision of the bank belong from the nature of government to the states who authorize be to legislature that the people must mainly look for action on that subject but as the conduct of the|federal|government in the management of revenue have also a powerful though less immediate influence upon become duty to see that a proper direction be give to while the keeping of the public revenue in a separate and independent treasury and of collect in gold and silver will have a salutary influence on the system of paper credit with which all bank be connect and thus aid those that be sound and well manage will at the same time sensibly check such as be otherwise by at once withhold the mean of extravagance afford by the public fund and restrain from excessive issue of note which would be constantly call upon to redeem be aware have be urge that this control may be best attain and exert by mean of a national bank the constitutional objection which be well known to entertain would prevent in any event from propose or assent to that remedy but in addition to this can not after past experience bring to think that can any longer be extensively regard as effective for such a purpose the history of the late national bank through all mutation show that be not so on the contrary may after a careful consideration of the subject be think safely state that at every period of banking excess take the lead that in and in in and in vast expansion follow by distress contraction lead to those of the state institution swell and madden the tide of the banking system but seldom allay or safely direct at a few period only be a salutary control exercise but an eager desire on the contrary exhibit for profit in the first place and if afterwards measure be severe toward other institution be because own safety compel to adopt do not differ from in principle or in form measure emanate from the same spirit of gain feel the same temptation to overissue suffer from and be totally unable to avert those inevitable law of trade by which be affect equally with and at least on occasion at an|early|day be save only by extraordinary exertion from the same fate that attend the weak institution profess to supervise in fail equally with other in redeem note though the|two|year allow by charter for that purpose have not expire a large amount of which remain to the present time outstanding be true that have so vast a capital and strengthen by the use of all the revenue of the government possess more power but while be by that circumstance free from the control which all bank require paramount object and inducement be leave the same to make the most for stockholder not to regulate the currency of the country nor have as far as be advise be find to be greatly otherwise elsewhere the national character give to the|bank|of|england have not prevent excessive fluctuation in currency and prove unable to keep off a suspension of specie payment which last for nearly|a|quarter|of|a|century and why should expect to be otherwise a national institution though derive charter from a different source than the state bank be yet constitute upon the same principle be conduct by man equally expose to temptation and be liable to the same disaster with the additional disadvantage that magnitude occasion an extent of confusion and distress which the mismanagement of small institution could not produce can scarcely be doubt that the recent suspension of the|united|state|bank|of|pennsylvania of which the effect be feel not in that state alone but over|half the union have origin in a course of business commence while be a national institution and there be no good reason for suppose that the same consequence would not have follow have still derive power from the|general|government be in vain when the influence and impulse be the same to look for a difference in conduct or result by such creation do therefore but increase the mass of paper credit and paper currency without check attendant evil and fluctuation the extent of power and the efficiency of organization which give so far from be beneficial be in practice positively injurious strengthen the chain of dependence throughout the union subject all part more certainly to common disaster and bind every bank more effectually in the first instance to those of commercial city and in the end to a foreign power in a word can not but believe that with the full understanding of the operation of banking system which experience have produce public sentiment be not less opposed to the creation of a national bank for purpose connect with currency and commerce than for those connect with the fiscal operation of the government yet the commerce and currency of the country be suffer evil from the operation of the state bank which can not and ought not to be overlook by mean have be flood with a depreciated paper which be evidently the design of the framer of the constitution to prevent when require congress to coin money and regulate the value of foreign coin and when forbid the states to coin money emit bill of credit make anything but gold and silver a tender in payment of debt or pass any law impair the obligation of contract if do not guard more explicitly against the present state of thing be because could not have anticipate that the few bank then exist be to swell to an extent which would expel to so great a degree the gold and silver for which have provide from the channel of circulation and fill with a currency that defeat the object have in view the remedy for this must chiefly rest with the states from whose legislation have spring no good that may accrue in a particular case front the exercise of power not obviously confer on the|general|government would authorize interference or justify a course that may in the slight degree increase at the expense of the states the power of the federal authority nor do doubt that the states will apply the remedy within the|last|few|year event have appeal to too strongly to be disregard have see that the constitution though theoretically adhere to be subvert in practice that while on the statute book there be no legal tender but gold and silver no law impair the obligation of contract yet that in point of fact the privilege confer on banking corporation have make note the currency of the country that the obligation impose by these note be violate under the impulse of interest or convenience and that the number and power of the person connect with these corporation or place under influence give a fearful weight when interest be in opposition to the spirit of the constitution and law to the people be immaterial whether these result be produce by open violation of the latter or by the working of a system of which the result be the same an inflexible execution even of the exist statute of most of the states would redress many evil now endure would effectually show the bank the danger of mismanagement which impunity encourage to repeat and would teach all corporation the useful lesson that be the subject of the law and the servant of the people what be still want to effect these object must be seek in additional legislation or if that be inadequate in such further constitutional grant or restriction as may bring back into the path from which have so widely wander in the meantime be the duty of the|general|government to cooperate with the states by a wise exercise of constitutional power and the enforcement of exist law the extent to which may do so by further enactment have already advert to and the wisdom of congress may yet enlarge but above all be incumbent upon to hold erect the principle of morality and law constantly execute own contract in accordance with the provision of the constitution and thus serve as a rallying point by which whole country may be bring back to that safe and honor standard people will not long be insensible to the extent of the burden entail upon by the false system that have be operate on sanguine energetic and industrious character nor to the mean necessary to extricate from these embarrassment the weight which press upon a large portion of the people and the states be an enormous debt foreign and domestic the foreign debt of states corporation and man of business can scarcely be require more|than|$10,000,000 a year to pay the interest this sum have to be pay out of the export of the country and must of necessity cut off import to that extent or plunge the country more deeply in debt from year to year be easy to see that the increase of this foreign debt must augment the annual demand on the export to pay the interest and to the same extent diminish the import and in proportion to the enlargement of the foreign debt and the consequent increase of interest must be the decrease of the import trade in lieu of the comfort which now bring may have gigantic banking institution and splendid but in many instance profitless railroad and canal absorb to a great extent in interest upon the capital borrow to construct the surplus fruit of national industry for year to come and secure to posterity no adequate return for the comfort which the labor of hand may otherwise have secure be not by the increase of this debt that relief be to be seek but in diminution upon this point there be be happy to say hope before not so much in the return of confidence abroad which will enable the states to borrow more money as in a change of public feeling at home which prompt people to pause in career and think of the mean by which debt be to be pay before be contract if would escape embarrassment public and private must cease to run in debt except for object of necessity or such as will yield a certain return let the faith of the states corporation and individual already pledge be keep with the most punctilious regard be due to national character as well as to justice that this should on the part of each be a fix principle of conduct but behoove all to be more chary in pledge hereafter by cease to run in debt and apply the surplus of crop and income to the discharge of exist obligation buy less and sell more and manage all affair public and private with strict economy and frugality shall see country soon recover from a temporary depression arise not from natural and permanent cause but from those have enumerate and advance with renew vigor in career of prosperity fortunately for at this moment when the balance of trade be greatly against and the difficulty of meeting enhance by the disturb state of money affair the bounty of providence have come to relieve from the consequence of past error a faithful application of the immense result of the labor of the|last|season will afford partial relief for the present and perseverance in the same course will in due season accomplish the rest have have full experience in time past of the extraordinary result which can in this respect be bring about in a short period by the united and well direct effort of a community like ours surplus profit the energy and industry of population and the wonderful advantage which providence have bestow upon country in climate various production indispensable to other nation will in due time afford abundant mean to perfect the most useful of those object for which the states have be plunge of late in embarrassment and debt without impose on or child such fearful burden but let be indelibly engrave on mind that relief be not to be find in expedient indebtedness can not be lessen by borrow more money or by change the form of the debt the balance of trade be not to be turn in favor by create new demand upon abroad currency can not be improve by the creation of new bank or more issue from those which now exist although these device sometimes appear to give temporary relief almost invariably aggravate the evil in the end be only by retrenchment and reform by curtail public and private expenditure by pay debt and by reform banking system that be to expect effectual relief security for the future and an endure prosperity in shape the institution and policy of the|general|government so as to promote as far as can with limited power these important end may rely on most cordial cooperation that there should have be in the progress of recent event doubt in many|quarter and in some a heated opposition to every change can not surprise doubt be properly attendant on all reform and be peculiarly in the nature of such abuse as be now encounter to seek to perpetuate power by mean of the influence have be permit to acquire be result if not object to gain for the few an ascendency over the many by secure to a monopoly of the currency the medium through which most of the want of mankind be supply to produce throughout society a chain of dependence which lead all class to look to privileged association for the mean of speculation and extravagance to nourish in preference to the manly virtue that give dignity to human nature a crave desire for luxurious enjoyment and sudden wealth which render those who seek dependent on those who supply to substitute for republican simplicity and economical habit a sickly appetite for effeminate indulgence and an imitation of that reckless extravagance which impoverish and enslave the industrious people of foreign land and at last to fix upon instead of those equal political right the acquisition of which be alike the object and suppose reward of revolutionary struggle a system of exclusive privilege confer by partial legislation to remove the influence which have thus gradually grow up among to deprive of deceptive advantage to test by the light of wisdom and truth to oppose the force which concentrate in sup port all this be necessarily the work of time even among a people so enlightened and pure as that of in most other country perhaps could only be accomplish through that series of revolutionary movement which be too often find necessary to effect any great and radical reform but be the crowning merit of institution that create and nourish in the vast majority of people a disposition and a power peaceably to remedy abuse which have elsewhere cause the effusion of river of blood and the sacrifice of thousand of the human race the result thus far be most honorable to the self denial the intelligence and the patriotism of citizen justify the confident hope that will carry through the reform which have be so well begin and that will go still further than have yet go in illustrate the important truth that a people as free and enlighten as our will whenever become necessary show to be indeed capable of self government by voluntarily adopt appropriate remedy for every abuse and submit to temporary sacrifice however great to insure permanent welfare own exertion for the furtherance of these desirable object have be bestow throughout official career with a zeal that be nourish by ardent wish for the welfare of country and by an unlimited reliance on the wisdom that mark ultimate decision on all great and controverted question impress with the solemn obligation impose upon by the constitution desirous also of lay before fellow citizen with whose confidence and support have be so highly honor such measure as appear to conducive to prosperity and anxious to submit to full consideration the ground upon which opinion be form have on this as on precede occasion freely offer view on those point of domestic policy that seem at the present time most prominently to require the action of the government know that will receive from congress that full and able consideration which the importance of the subject merit and can repeat the assurance heretofore make that shall cheerfully and readily cooperate with in every measure that will tend to promote the welfare of the union transcript to the senate and house|of|representatif lie before congress several dispatch from excellency the governor of maine with inclosure communicate certain proceeding of the legislature of that state and a copy of the reply of the secretary of state make by direction together with a note from h.|s.|fox esq envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of great|britain with the answer of the secretary of state to the same will appear from those document that a numerous band of lawless and desperate man chiefly from the adjoin british|provinces but without the authority or sanction of the provincial government have trespass upon that portion of the territory in dispute between the|united|state and great|britain which be water by the river aroostook and claim to belong to the|state|of|maine and that have commit extensive depredation there by cut and destroy a very large quantity of timber will further appear that the governor of maine have be officially apprise of the circumstance have communicate to the legislature with a recommendation of such provision in addition to those already exist by law as would enable to arrest the course of say depredation disperse the trespasser and secure the timber which be about carry away that in compliance with a resolve of the legislature pass in pursuance of recommendation excellency have dispatch the land agent of the state with a force deem adequate to that purpose to the scene of the allege depredation who after accomplish a part of duty be seize by a band of the trespasser at a house claim to be within the jurisdiction of maine whither have repair for the purpose of meeting and consult with the land agent of the|province|of|new|brunswick and convey as a prisoner to frederickton in that province together with other citizen of the state who be assist in the discharge of duty will also appear that the governor and legislature of maine satisfy that the trespasser have act in defiance of the law of both country learn that be in possession of arm and anticipate correctly as the result have prove that person of reckless and desperate character would set at naught the authority of the magistrate without the aid of a strong force have authorize the sheriff and the officer appoint in the place of the land agent to employ at the expense of the state an armed posse who have proceed to the scene of these depredation with a view to the entire dispersion or arrest of the trespasser and the protection of the public property in the correspondence between the governor of maine and sir john|harvey lieutenant governor of the|province|of|new|brunswick which have grow out of these occurrence and be likewise herewith communicate the former be request to recall the armed party advance into the dispute territory for the arrest of trespasser and be inform that a strong body of british troop be to be hold in readiness to support and protect the authority and subject of great|britain in say territory in answer to that request the provincial governor be inform of the determination of the|state|of|maine to support the land agent and party in the performance of duty and the same determination for the execution of which provision be make by a resolve of the state legislature be communicate by the governor to the|general|government the lieutenant governor of new|brunswick in call upon the governor of maine for the recall of the land agent and party from the dispute territory and the british minster in make a similar demand upon the government of the|united|state proceed upon the assumption that an agreement exist between the nation concede to great|britain until the final settlement of the boundary question exclusive possession of and jurisdiction over the territory in dispute the important bearing which such an agreement if exist would have upon the condition and interest of the party and the influence may have upon the adjustment of the dispute be too obvious to allow the error upon which this assumption seem to rest to pass for a moment without correction the answer of the secretary of state to mr. fox 's note will show the ground take by the|government|of|the|united|state upon this point be believe that all the correspondence which have pass between the government upon this subject have already be communicate to congress and be now on file an abstract of however hastily prepare accompany this communication be possible that in thus abridge a voluminous correspondence commence in and continue to a very recent period a portion may have be accidentally overlook but be believe that nothing have take place which would materially change the aspect of the question as therein present instead of sustain the assumption of the british functionary that correspondence disprove the existence of any such agreement show that the government have differ not only in regard to the main question of title to the territory in dispute but with reference also to the right of jurisdiction and the fact of the actual exercise of in different portion thereof always aim at an amicable adjustment of the dispute both party have entertain and repeatedly urge upon each other a desire that each should exercise right whatever consider to be in such a manner as to avoid collision and allay to the great practicable extent the excitement likely to grow out of the controversy be in pursuance of such an understanding that maine and massachusetts upon the remonstrance of great|britain desist from make sale of land and the|general|government from the construction of a project military road in a portion of the territory of which claim to have enjoy the exclusive possession and that great|britain on part in deference to a similar remonstrance from the|united|state suspend the issue of license to cut timber in the territory in controversy and also the survey and location of a railroad through a section of country over which also claim to have exercise exclusive jurisdiction the|state|of|maine have a right to arrest the depredation complain of belong to to judge of the exigency of the occasion call for interference and be presume that have the lieutenant governor of new|brunswick be correctly advise of the nature of the proceeding of the|state|of|maine would not have regard the transaction as require on part any resort to force each party claim a right to the territory and hence to the exclusive jurisdiction over be manifest that to prevent the destruction of the timber by trespasser act against the authority of both and at the same time avoid forcible collision between the contiguous government during the pendency of negotiation concern the title resort must be have to the mutual exercise of jurisdiction in such extreme case or to an amicable and temporary arrangement as to the limit within which should be exercise by each party the understanding suppose to exist between the|united|state and great|britain have be find heretofore sufficient for that purpose and believe will prove so hereafter if the party on the frontier directly interested in the question be respectively govern by a just spirit of conciliation and forbearance if shall be find as there be now reason to apprehend that there be in the mode of construe that understanding by the government a difference not to be reconcile shall not hesitate to propose to britannic majesty 's government a distinct arrangement for the temporary and mutual exercise of jurisdiction by mean of which similar difficulty may in future be prevent but between an effort on the part of maine to preserve the property in dispute from destruction by intruder and a military occupation by that state of the territory with a view to hold by force while the settlement be a subject of negotiation between the government there be an essential difference as well in respect to the position of the state as to the duty of the|general|government in a letter address by the secretary of state to the governor of maine on the|1st|of|march|last give a detailed statement of the step which have be take by the|federal|government to bring the controversy to a termination and design to apprise the governor of that state of the view of the|federal|executive in respect to the future be state that while the obligation of the|federal|government to do all in power to effect the settlement of the boundary question be fully recognize have in the event of be unable to do so specifically by mutual consent no other mean to accomplish that object amicably than by another arbitration or by a commission with an umpire in the nature of an arbitration and that in the event of all other measure fail the president would feel duty to submit another proposition to the|government|of|great|britain to refer the decision of the question to a third power these be still view upon the subject and until this step shall have be take can not think proper to invoke the attention of congress to other than amicable mean for the settlement of the controversy or to cause the military power of the|federal|government to be bring in aid of the|state|of|maine in any attempt to effect that object by a resort to force on the other hand if the authority of new|brunswick should attempt to enforce the claim of exclusive jurisdiction set up by by mean of a military occupation on part of the dispute territory shall feel bind to consider the contingency provide by the constitution as have occur on the happening of which a state have the right to call for the aid of the|federal|government to repel invasion have express to the british minister near this government a confident expectation that the agent of the|state|of|maine who have be arrest under an obvious misapprehension of the object of mission will be promptly release and to the governor of maine that a similar course will be pursue in regard to the agent of the|province|of|new|brunswick have also recommend that any militia that may have be bring together by the|state|of|maine from an apprehension of a collision with the government or people of the|british|province will be voluntarily and peaceably disband can not allow to doubt that the result anticipate from these representation will be seasonably realize the party more immediately interested can not but perceive that an appeal to arm under exist circumstance will not only prove fatal to present interest but would postpone if not defeat the attainment of the main object which have in view the very incident which have recently occur will necessarily awaken the government to the importance of promptly adjust a dispute by which be now make manifest that the peace of the nation be daily and imminently endanger this expectation be further warrant by the general forbearance which have hitherto characterize the conduct of the government and people on both side of the line in the uniform patriotism of maine attachment to the union respect for the wish of the people of sister states of whose interest in welfare can not be unconscious and in the solicitude feel by the country at large for the preservation of peace with neighbor have a strong guaranty that will not disregard the request that have be make of as however the session of congress be about to terminate and the agency of the executive may become necessary during the recess be important that the attention of the legislature should be draw to the consideration of such measure as may be calculate to obviate the necessity of a call for an extra session with that view have think duty to lay the whole matter before and to invite such action thereon as may think the occasion require transcript fellow citizens of the senate and house|of|representatif congratulate on the favorable circumstance in the condition of country under which reassemble for the performance of official duty though the anticipation of an abundant harvest have not everywhere be realize yet on the whole the labor of the husbandman be reward with a bountiful return industry prosper in various channel of

rival sovereignty temptation to interfere in the intestine commotion of neighboring country the dangerous influence that arise in period of excessive prosperity and the antirepublican tendency of associate wealth these with other trial not less formidable have all be encounter and thus far successfully resist be reserve for the|american|union to test the advantage of a government entirely

the great principle from which have spring constant and direct supervision by the people over every public measure strict forbearance on the part of the government from exercise any doubtful or dispute power and a cautious abstinence from all interference with concern which properly belong and be best leave to state regulation and individual enterprise full information of the state of foreign affair have be recently on different occasion submit to congress deem necessary now to bring to notice only such event as have subsequently occur or be of such importance as to require particular attention the most amicable disposition continue to be exhibit by all the nation with whom the government and citizen of the|united|state have an habitual intercourse at the date of last annual message mexico be the only nation which could not be include in so gratify a reference to foreign relation be happy to be now able to inform that an advance have be make toward the adjustment of difference with that republic and the restoration of the customary good feeling between the nation this important change have be effect by conciliatory negotiation that have result in the conclusion of a treaty between the government which when ratified will refer to the arbitrament of a friendly power all the subject of controversy between grow out of injury to individual there be at present also reason to believe that an equitable settlement of all dispute point will be attain without further difficulty or unnecessary delay and thus authorize the free resumption of diplomatic intercourse with sister republic with respect to the northeastern boundary of the|united|state no official correspondence between this government and that of great|britain have pass since that communicate to congress toward the close of last session the offer to negotiate a convention for the appointment of a joint commission of survey and exploration be however assure will be meet by her|majesty's|government in a conciliatory and friendly spirit and instruction to enable the british minister here to conclude such an arrangement will be transmit to without needless delay be hope and expect that these instruction will be of a liberal character and that this negotiation if successful will prove to be an important step toward the satisfactory and final adjustment of the controversy have hope that the respect for the law and regard for the peace and honor of own country which have ever characterize the citizen of the|united|state would have prevent any portion of from use any mean to promote insurrection in the territory of a power with which be at peace and with which the|united|state be desirous of maintain the most friendly relation regret deeply however to be oblige to inform that this have not be the case information have be give to derive from official and other source that many citizen of the|united|state have associate together to make hostile incursion from territory into canada and to aid and abet insurrection there in violation of the obligation and law of the|united|state and in open disregard of own duty as citizen this information have be in part confirm by a hostile invasion actually make by citizen of the|united|state in conjunction with canadians and other and accompany by a forcible seizure of the property of citizen and an application thereof to the prosecution of military operation against the authority and people of canada the result of these criminal assault upon the peace and order of a neighbor country have be as be to be expect fatally destructive to the misguided or delude person engage in and highly injurious to those in whose behalf be profess to have be undertake the authority in canada from intelligence receive of such intended movement among citizen have feel oblige to take precautionary measure against have actually embody the militia and assume an attitude to repel the invasion to which believe the colony be expose from the|united|state a state of feel on both side of the frontier have thus be produce which call for prompt and vigorous interference if an insurrection exist in canada the amicable disposition of the|united|state toward great|britain as well as duty to would lead to maintain a strict neutrality and to restrain citizen from all violation of the law which have be pass for enforcement but this government recognize a still high obligation to repress all attempt on the part of citizen to disturb the peace of a country where order prevail or have be reestablish depredation by citizen upon nation at peace with the|united|state or combination for commit have at all time be regard by the|american|government and people with the great abhorrence military incursion by citizen into country so situated and the commission of act of violence on the member thereof in order to effect a change in government or under any pretext whatever have from the commencement of government be hold equally criminal on the part of those engage in and as much deserving of punishment as would be the disturbance of the public peace by the perpetration of similar act within own territory by no country or person have these invaluable principle of international law principle the strict observance of which be so indispensable to the preservation of social order in the world be more earnestly cherish or sacredly respect than by those great and good man who first declare and finally establish the independence of own country promulgate and maintain at an early and critical period in history be subsequently embody in legislative enactment of a highly penal character the faithful enforcement of which have hitherto be and will trust always continue to be regard as a duty inseparably associate with the maintenance of national honor that the people of the|united|state should feel an interest in the spread of political institution as free as regard own to be be natural nor can a sincere solicitude for the success of all those who be at any time in good faith struggle for acquisition be impute to citizen as a crime with the entire freedom of opinion and an undisguised expression thereof on part the government have neither the right nor trust the disposition to interfere but whether the interest or the honor of the|united|states require that should be make a party to any such struggle and by inevitable consequence to the war which be wag in support be a question which by constitution be wisely leave to congress alone to decide be by the law already make criminal in citizen to embarrass or anticipate that decision by unauthorized military operation on part offense of this character in addition to criminality as violation of the law of country have a direct tendency to draw down upon own citizen at large the multiply evil of a foreign war and expose to injurious imputation the good faith and honor of the country as such deserve to be put down with promptitude and decision can not be mistaken be confident in counting on the cordial and general concurrence of fellow citizen in this sentiment a copy of the proclamation which have feel duty to issue be herewith communicate can not but hope that the good sense and patriotism the regard for the honor and reputation of country the respect for the law which have enact for own government and the love of order for which the mass of people have be so long and so justly distinguished will deter the comparatively few who be engage in from a further prosecution of such desperate enterprise in the meantime the exist law have be and will continue to be faithfully execute and every effort will be make to carry out in full extent whether be sufficient or not to meet the actual state of thing on the canadian frontier be for congress to decide will appear from the correspondence herewith submit that the government|of|russia decline a renewal of the fourth article of the convention of april,|1824 between the|united|state and imperial majesty by the third article of which be agree that hereafter there shall not be form by the citizen of the|united|state or under the authority of the say states any establishment upon the northwest coast of america nor in any of the island adjacent to the north of ' of north latitude and that in the same manner there shall be none form by russian subject or under the authority of russia south of the same parallel and by the fourth article that during a term of ten|year count from the signature of the present convention the ship of both power or which belong to citizen or subject respectively may reciprocally frequent without any hindrance whatever the interior sea gulfs harbor and creek upon the coast mention in the precede article for the purpose of fishing and trading with the native of the country the reason assign for decline to renew the provision of this article be briefly that the only use make by citizen of the privilege secure to have be to supply the indians with spirituous liquor ammunition and firearm that this traffic have be exclude from the russian trade and as the supply furnish from the|united|state be injurious to the russian establishment on the northwest coast and calculate to produce complaint between the government imperial majesty think for the interest of both country not to accede to the proposition make by the|american|government for the renewal of the article last refer to the correspondence herewith communicate will show the ground upon which contend that the citizen of the|united|state have independent of the provision of the convention of a right to trade with the native upon the coast in question at unoccupied place liable however be admit to be at any time extinguish by the creation of russian establishment at such point this right be deny by the|russian|government which assert that by the operation of the|treaty|of|1824 each party agree to waive the general right to land on the vacant coast on the respective side of the degree of latitude refer to and accept in lieu thereof the mutual privilege mention in the fourth article the capital and tonnage employ by citizen in trade with the northwest coast of america will perhaps on advert to the official statement of the commerce and navigation of the|united|state for the|last|few|year be deem too inconsiderable in amount to attract much attention yet the subject may in other respect deserve the careful consideration of congress regret to state that the blockade of the principal port on the eastern coast of mexico which in consequence of difference between that republic and france be institute in may last unfortunately still continue enforce by a competent french naval armament and be necessarily embarrassing to own trade in the gulf in common with that of other nation every disposition however be believe to exist on the part of the|french|government to render this measure as little onerous as practicable to the interest of the citizen of the|united|state and to those of neutral commerce and be to be hope that an early settlement of the difficulty between france and mexico will soon reestablish the harmonious relation formerly subsist between and again open the port of that republic to the vessel of all friendly nation a convention for mark that part of the boundary between the|united|state and the|republic|of|texas which extend from the mouth of the sabine to the|red|river be conclude and sign at this city on the 25th of april last have since be ratify by both government and seasonable measure will be take to carry into effect on the part of the|united|state the application of that republic for admission into this union make in august,|1837 and which be decline for reason already make known to have be formally withdraw as will appear from the accompanying copy of the note of the minister plenipotentiary of texas which be present to the secretary of state on the occasion of the exchange of the ratification of the convention above mention copy of the convention with texas of a commercial treaty conclude with the king of greece and of a similar treaty with the|peru bolivian|confederation the ratification of which have be recently exchange accompany this message for the information of congress and for such legislative enactment as may be find necessary or expedient in relation to either of to watch over and foster the interest of a gradually increase and widely extend commerce to guard the right of american citizen whom business or pleasure or other motif may tempt into distant clime and at the same time to cultivate those sentiment of mutual respect and good will which experience have prove so beneficial in international intercourse have deem expedient from time to time to establish diplomatic connection with different foreign state by the appointment of representative to reside within respective territory be gratify to be enable to announce to that since the close of last session these relation have be open under the happy auspex with austria and the|two|sicilies that new nomination have be make in the respective mission of russia brazil belgium and sweden and norway in this country and that a minister extraordinary have be receive accredit to this government from the|argentine|confederation an exposition of the fiscal affair of the government and of condition for the|past|year will be make to by the secretary of the treasury the available balance in the treasury on the|1st|of|january next be estimate at the receipt of the|year from custom and land will probably amount to these usual source of revenue have be increase by an issue of treasury note of which less|than|$8,000,000 include interest and principal will be outstanding at the|end|of|the|year and by the sale of of the bond of the|bank|of|the|united|state for the aggregate of mean from these and other source with the balance on hand on the|1st|of|january|last have be apply to the payment of appropriation by congress the whole expenditure for the|year on account include the redemption of more|than|eight|million of treasury note constitute an aggregate of about|$40,000,000 and will still leave in the treasury the balance before state nearly|$8,000,000 of treasury note be to be pay during the|coming|year in addition to the ordinary appropriation for the support of government for both these purpose the resource of the treasury will undoubtedly be sufficient if the charge upon be not increase beyond the annual estimate no excess however be likely to exist nor can the postpone installment of the surplus revenue be deposit with the states nor any considerable appropriation beyond the estimate be make without cause a deficiency in the treasury the great caution advisable at all time of limit appropriation to the want of the public service be render necessary at present by the prospective and rapid reduction of the tariff while the vigilant jealousy evidently excite among the people by the occurrence of the|last|few|year assure that expect from representative and will sustain in the exercise of the most rigid economy much can be effect by postpone appropriation not immediately require for the ordinary public service or for any press emergency and much by reduce the expenditure where the entire and immediate accomplishment of the object in view be not indispensable when call to mind the recent and extreme embarrassment produce by excessive issue of bank paper aggravate by the unforeseen withdrawal of much foreign capital and the inevitable derangement arise from the distribution of the surplus revenue among the states as require by congress and consider the heavy expense incur by the removal of indian tribe by the military operation in florida and on account of the unusually large appropriation make at the last annual session of congress for other object have strike evidence in the present efficient state of finance of the abundant resource of the country to fulfill all obligation nor be less gratify to find that the general business of the community deeply affected as have be be revive with additional vigor chasten by the lesson of the past and animate by the hope of the future by the curtailment of paper issue by curb the sanguine and adventurous spirit of speculation and by the honorable application of all available mean to the fulfillment of obligation confidence have be restore both at home and abroad and ease and facility secure to all the operation of trade the agency of the government in produce these result have be as efficient as power and mean permit by withholding from the states the deposit of the fourth installment and leave several|million at long credit with the bank principally in section of the country and more immediately beneficial to and at the same time aid the bank and commercial community in other section by postpone the payment of bond for duty to the amount of between|four|and|five|millions|of|dollar by an issue of treasury note as a means to enable the government to meet the consequence of indulgence but afford at the same time facility for remittance and exchange and by steadily decline to employ as general depository of the public revenue or receive the note of all bank which refuse to redeem with specie by these measure aid by the favorable action of some of the bank and by the support and cooperation of a large portion of the community have witness an early resumption of specie payment in great commercial capital promptly follow in almost every part of the|united|state this result have be alike salutary to the true interest of agriculture commerce and manufacture to public moral respect for the law and that confidence between man and man which be so essential in all social relation the contrast between the suspension of and that of be most striking the short duration of the latter the prompt restoration of business the evident benefit result from an adherence by the government to the constitutional standard of value instead of sanction the suspension by the receipt of irredeemable paper and the advantage derive from the large amount of specie introduce into the country previous to afford a valuable illustration of the true policy of the government in such a crisis nor can the comparison fail to remove the impression that a national bank be necessary in such emergency not only be specie payment resume without aid but exchange have also be more rapidly restore than when exist thereby show that private capital enterprise and prudence be fully adequate to these end on all these point experience seem to have confirm the view heretofore submit to congress have be save the mortification of see the distress of the community for the third time seize on to fasten upon the country so dangerous an institution and may also hope that the business of individual will hereafter be relieve from the injurious effect of a continued agitation of that disturb subject the limited influence of a national bank in avert derangement in the exchange of the country or in compel the resumption of specie payment be now not less apparent than tendency to increase inordinate speculation by sudden expansion and contraction disposition to create panic and embarrassment for the promotion of own design interference with politic and far great power for evil than for good either in regard to the local institution or the operation of government what be in these respect but apprehension or opinion when a national bank be first establish now stand confirm by humiliating experience the scene through which have pass conclusively prove how little commerce agriculture manufacture or finance require such an institution and what danger be attendant on power a power trust never to be confer by the american people upon government and still less upon individual not responsible to for unavoidable abuse conviction of the necessity of further legislative provision for the safe keeping and disbursement of the public money and opinion in regard to the measure best adapt to the accomplishment of those object have be already submit to these have be strengthen by recent event and in the full conviction that time and experience must still further demonstrate propriety feel duty with respectful deference to the conflicting view of other again to invite attention to with the exception of limited sum deposit in the few bank still employ under the act of the amount receive for duty and with very inconsiderable exception those accrue from land also have since the general suspension of specie payment by the deposit bank be keep and disburse by the treasurer under general legal power subject to the superintendence of the secretary of the treasury the propriety of define more specifically and of regulate by law the exercise of this wide scope of executive discretion have be already submit to congress a change in the office of collector at of principal port have bring to light a defalcation of the grave character the particular of which will be lay before in a special report from the secretary of the treasury by report and the accompany document will be see that the weekly return of the default officer apparently exhibit throughout a faithful administration of the affair intrust to management however now appear that commence abstract the public money shortly after appointment and continue to do so progressively increase the amount for the term of more|than|seven|year embrace a portion of the period during which the public money be deposit in the|bank|of|the|united|states the whole of that of the state bank deposit system and conclude only on retirement from office after that system have substantially fail in consequence of the suspension of specie payment the way in which this defalcation be so long conceal and the step take to indemnify the|united|state as far as practicable against loss will also be present to the ease be which imperatively claim the attention of congress and furnish the strong motive for the establishment of a more severe and secure system for the safe keep -and disbursement of the public money than any that have heretofore exist seem proper at all event that by an early enactment similar to that of other country the application of public money by an officer of government to private us should be make a felony and visit with severe and ignominious punishment this be already in effect the law in respect to the mint and have be productive of the most salutary result whatever system be adopt such an enactment would be wise as an independent measure since much of the public money must in collection and ultimate disbursement pass twice through the hand of public officer in whatever manner be intermediately keep the government must be admit have be from commencement comparatively fortunate in this respect but the appoint power can not always be well advise in selection and the experience of every country have show that public officer be not at all time proof against temptation be a duty therefore which the government owe as well to the interest commit to care as to the officer to provide every guard against transgression of this character that be consistent with reason and humanity congress can not be too jealous of the conduct of those who be intrust with the public money and shall at all time be dispose to encourage a watchful discharge of this duty if a more direct cooperation on the part of congress in the supervision of the conduct of the officer intrust with the custody and application of the public money be deem desirable will give pleasure to assist in the establishment of any judicious and constitutional plan by which that object may be accomplish will in wisdom determine upon the propriety of adopt such a plan and upon the measure necessary to effectual execution when the late bank|of|the|united|state be incorporate and make the depository of the public money a right be reserve to congress to inspect at pleasure by a committee of that body the book and the proceeding of the bank in of the states whose banking institution be suppose to rank amongst the first in point of stability be subject to constant examination by commissioner appoint for that purpose and much of the success of banking system be attribute to this watchful supervision the same course have also in view of beneficial operation be adopt by an adjoin state favorably known for the care have always bestow upon whatever relate to financial concern submit to consideration whether a committee of congress may not be profitably employ in inspect at such interval as may be deem proper the affair and account of officer intrust with the custody of the public money the frequent performance of this duty may be make obligatory on the committee in respect to those officer who have large sum in possession and leave discretionary in respect to other may report to the executive such defalcation as be find to exist with a view to a prompt removal from office unless the default be satisfactorily account for and report also to congress at the commencement of each session the result of examination and proceeding do appear to that with a subjection of this class of public officer to the general supervision of the executive to examination by a committee of congress at period of which should have no previous notice and to prosecution and punishment as for felony for every breach of trust the safe keeping of the public money may under the system propose be place on a sure foundation than have ever occupy since the establishment of the government the secretary of the treasury will lay before additional information contain new detail on this interesting subject to these ask early attention that should have give rise to great diversity of opinion can not be a subject of surprise after the collection and custody of the public money have be for so|many|year connect with and make subsidiary to the advancement of private interest a return to the simple self deny ordinance of the constitution could not but be difficult but time and free discussion elicit the sentiment of the people and aid by that conciliatory spirit which have ever characterize course on great emergency be rely upon for a satisfactory settlement of the question already have this anticipation on important point at least the impropriety of divert public money to private purpose be fully realize there be no reason to suppose that legislation upon that branch of the subject would now be embarrass by a difference of opinion or fail to receive the cordial support of a large majority of constituent the connection which formerly exist between the government and bank be in reality injurious to both as well as to the general interest of the community at large aggravate the disaster of trade and the derangement of commercial intercourse and administer new excitement and additional mean to wild and reckless speculation the disappointment of which throw the country into convulsion of panic and all but produce violence and bloodshed the imprudent expansion of bank credit which be the natural result of the command of the revenue of the state furnish the resource for unbounded license in every species of adventure seduce industry from regular and salutary occupation by the hope of abundance without labor and derange the social state by tempt all trade and profession into the vortex of speculation on remote contingency the same wide spread influence impede also the resource of the government curtail useful operation embarrass the fulfillment of obligation and seriously interfere with the execution of the law large appropriation and oppressive taxis be the natural consequence of such a connection since increase the profit of those who be allow to use the public fund and make interest that money should be accumulate and expenditure multiply be thus that a concentrated money power be tempt to become an active agent in political affair and all past experience have show on which side that influence will be array deceive if suppose that will ever be find asserting and support the right of the community at large in opposition to the claim of the few in a government whose distinguish characteristic should be a diffusion and equalization of benefit and burden the advantage of individual will be augment at the expense of the community at large nor be the nature of combination for the acquisition of legislative influence to confine interference to the single object for which be originally form the temptation to extend to other matter be on the contrary not unfrequently too strong to be resist the rightful influence in the direction of public affair of the mass of the people be therefore in no slight danger of be sensibly and injuriously affect by give to a comparatively small but very efficient class a direct and exclusive personal interest in so important a portion of the legislation of congress as that which relate to the custody of the public money if law act upon private interest can not always be avoid should be confine within the narrow limit and leave wherever possible to the legislature of the states when not thus restrict lead to combination of powerful association foster an influence necessarily selfish and turn the fair course of legislation to sinister end rather than to object that advance public liberty and promote the general good the whole subject now rest with and can not but express a hope that some definite measure will be adopt at the present session will not be sure be deem out of place for here to remark that the declaration of view in opposition to the policy of employ bank as depository of the government fund can not justly be construe as indicative of hostility official or personal to those institution or to repeat in this form and in connection with this subject opinion which have uniformly entertain and on all proper occasion express though always oppose to creation in the form of exclusive privilege and as a state magistrate aim by appropriate legislation to secure the community against the consequence of occasional mismanagement have yet ever wish to see protect in the exercise of right confer by law and have never doubt utility when properly manage in promote the interest of trade and through that channel the other interest of the community to present merely as state institution have no necessary connection with legislation or administration like other state establishment may be use or not in conduct the affair of the government as public policy and the general interest of the union may seem to require the only safe or proper principle upon which intercourse with the government can be regulate be that which regulate intercourse with the private citizen the conferring of mutual benefit when the government can accomplish a financial operation better with the aid of the bank than without should be at liberty to seek that aid as would the service of a private banker or other capitalist or agent give the preference to those who will serve on the good term nor can there ever exist an interest in the officer of the|general|government as such induce to embarrass or annoy the state bank any more than to incur the hostility of any other class of state institution or of private citizen be not in the nature of thing that hostility to these institution can spring from this source or any opposition to course of business except when depart from the object of creation and attempt to usurp power not confer upon or to subvert the standard of value establish by the constitution while opposition to regular operation can not exist in this|quarter resistance to any attempt to make the government dependent upon for the successful administration of public affair be a matter of duty as trust ever will be of inclination no matter from what motive or consideration the attempt may originate be no more than just to the bank to say that in the late emergency most of firmly resist the strong temptation to extend paper issue when apparently sustain in a suspension of specie payment by public opinion even though in some case invite by legislative enactment to this honorable course aid by the resistance of the|general|government act in obedience to the constitution and law of the|united|state to the introduction of an irredeemable paper medium may be attribute in a great degree the speedy restoration of currency to a sound state and the business of the country to wonted prosperity the bank have but to continue in the same safe course and be content in appropriate sphere to avoid all interference from the|general|government and to derive from all the protection and benefit which bestow on other state establishment on the people of the states and on the states in this true position can not but secure the confidence and good will of the people and the government which can only lose when leap from legitimate sphere attempt to control the legislation of the country and pervert the operation of the government to own purpose experience under the act pass at the last session to grant preemption right to settler on the public land have as yet be too limited to enable to pronounce with safety upon the efficacy of provision to carry out the wise and liberal policy of the government in that respect there be however the good reason to anticipate favorable result from operation the recommendation formerly submit to in respect to a graduation of the price of the public land remain to be finally act upon have find no reason to change the view then express attention to be again respectfully request every proper exertion have be make and will be continue to carry out the wish of congress in relation to the tobacco trade as indicate in the several resolution of the|house|of|representatives and the legislation of the branch a favorable impression have trust be make in the different foreign country to which particular attention have be direct and although can not hope for an early change in policy as in many of a convenient and large revenue be derive from monopoly in the fabrication and sale of this article yet as these monopoly be really injurious to the people where be establish and the revenue derive from may be less injuriously and with equal facility obtain from another and a liberal system of administration can not doubt that effort will be eventually crown with success if persist in with temperate firmness and sustain by prudent legislation in recommend to congress the adoption of the necessary provision at this session for take the next census or enumeration of the inhabitant of the|united|state the suggestion present whether the scope of the measure may not be usefully extend by cause to embrace authentic statistical return of the great interest specially intrust to or necessarily affect by the legislation of congress the accompanying report of the secretary of war present a satisfactory account of the state of the army and of the several branch of the public service confide to the superintendence of that officer the law increase and organize the military establishment of the|united|state have be nearly carry into effect and the army have be extensively and usefully employ during the|past|season would again call to notice the subject connect with and essential to the military defense of the country which be submit to at the last session but which be not act upon as be suppose for want of time the most important of be the organization of the militia on the maritime and inland frontier this measure be deem important as be believe that will furnish an effective volunteer force in aid of the|regular|army and may form the basis of a general system of organization for the entire militia of the|united|state the erection of a national foundry and gunpowder manufactory and for make small arm the latter to be situate at some point west of the|allegany|mountain all appear to be of sufficient importance to be again urge upon attention the plan propose by the secretary of war for the distribution of the force of the|united|state in time of peace be well calculated to promote regularity and economy in the fiscal administration of the service to preserve the discipline of the troop and to render available for the maintenance of the peace and tranquillity of the country with this view likewise recommend the adoption of the plan present by that officer for the defense of the western frontier the preservation of the life and property of fellow citizen who be settle upon that border country as well as the existence of the indian population which may be tempt by want of preparation to rush on own destruction and attack the white settlement all seem to require that this subject should be act upon without delay and authorize to place that country in a state of complete defense against any assault from the numerous and warlike tribe which be congregate on that border afford sincere pleasure to be able to apprise of the entire removal of the|cherokee|nation|of|indian to new home west of the mississippi the measure authorize by congress at last session with a view to the long stand controversy with have have the happy effect by an agreement conclude with by the commanding general in that country who have perform the duty assign to on the occasion with commendable energy and humanity removal have be principally under the conduct of own chief and have emigrate without any apparent reluctance the successful accomplishment of this important object the removal also of the entire creek|nation with the exception of a small number of fugitive amongst the seminoles in florida the progress already make toward a speedy completion of the removal of the chickasaws the choctaws the pottawatamies the ottawas and the chippewas with the extensive purchase of indian land during the|present|year have render the speedy and successful result of the long establish policy of the government upon the subject of indian affair entirely certain the occasion be therefore deem a proper one to place this policy in such a point of view as will exonerate the government of the|united|state from the undeserved reproach which have be cast upon through several successive administrations that a mixed occupancy of the same territory by the white and red man be incompatible with the safety or happiness of either be a position in respect to which there have long since cease to be room for a difference of opinion reason and experience have alike demonstrate impracticability the bitter fruit of every attempt heretofore to overcome the barrier interpose by nature have only be destruction both physical and moral to the indian dangerous conflict of authority between the|federal|and|state|government and detriment to the individual prosperity of the citizen as well as to the general improvement of the country the remedial policy the principle of which be settle more|than|thirty|years|ago under the administration of mr. jefferson consist in an extinction for a fair consideration of the title to all the land still occupy by the indians within the|state and territories of the|united|state removal to a country west of the mississippi much more extensive and better adapt to condition than that on which then reside the guarantee to by the|united|state of exclusive possession of that country forever exempt from all intrusion by white man with ample provision for security against external violence and internal dissension and the extension to of suitable facility for advancement in civilization this have not be the policy of particular administrations only but of each in succession since the first attempt to carry out under that of mr. monroe all have labor for accomplishment only with different degree of success the manner of execution have be true from time to time give rise to conflict of opinion and unjust imputation but in respect to the wisdom and necessity of the policy there have not from the beginning exist a doubt in the mind of any calm judicious disinterested friend of the indian race accustom to reflection and enlighten by experience occupy the double character of contractor on own account and guardian for the party contract with be hardly to be expect that the dealing of the|federal|government with the indian tribe would escape misrepresentation that there occur ill the early settlement of this country as in all other where the civilized race have succeed to the possession of the savage instance of oppression and fraud on the part of the former there be too much reason to believe no such offense can however be justly charge upon this government since become free to pursue own course dealing with the indian tribe have be just friendly throughout effort for civilization constant and direct by the good feeling of humanity watchfulness in protect from individual fraud unremitting forbearance under the keen provocation the deep injury and the most flagrant outrage may challenge at least a comparison with any nation ancient or modern in similar circumstance and if in future time a powerful civilized and happy nation of indians shall be find to exist within the limit of this northern continent will be owe to the consummation of that policy which have be so unjustly assail only a very brief reference to fact in confirmation of this assertion can in this form be give and be therefore necessarily refer to the report of the secretary of war for further detail to the cherokees whose case have perhaps excite the great share of attention and sympathy the|united|state have grant in fee with a perpetual guaranty of exclusive and peaceable possession of land on the west side of the mississippi eligibly situate in a healthy climate and in all respect better suit to condition than the country have leave in exchange for only|9,492 on the east side of the same river the|united|state have in addition stipulate to pay for interest in and improvement on the land thus relinquish and for subsistence and other beneficial purpose thereby put in power to become of the most wealthy and independent separate community of the same extent in the world by the treaty make and ratify with the miamies the chippewas the sioux the sacs and foxes and the winnebagoes during the|last|year the indian title to have be extinguish these purchase have be much more extensive than those of any|previous|year and have with other indian expense bear very heavily upon the treasury leave however but a small quantity of unbought indian land within the|state and territories and the|legislature|and|executive be equally sensible of the propriety of a final and more speedy extinction of indian title within those limit the treaty which be with a single exception make in pursuance of previous appropriation for defray the expense have subsequently be ratify by the senate and receive the sanction of congress by the appropriation necessary to carry into effect of the term upon which these important negotiation be conclude can speak from direct knowledge and feel no difficulty in affirm that the interest of the indians in the extensive territory embrace by be to be pay for at fair value and that no more favorable term have be grant to the|united|state than would have be reasonably expect in a negotiation with civilized man fully capable of appreciate and protect own right for the indian title to acquire since the|4th|of|march,|1829 the|united|state have pay in permanent annuity land reservation for indians expense of removal and subsistence merchandise mechanical and agricultural establishment and implement when the heavy expense incur by the|united|state and the circumstance that so large a portion of the entire territory will be forever unsalable be consider and this price be compare with that for which the|united|state sell own land no one can doubt that justice have be do to the indians in these purchase also certain be that the transaction of the|federal|government with the indians have be uniformly characterize by a sincere and paramount desire to promote welfare and must be a source of the high gratification to every friend to justice and humanity to learn that not withstand the obstruction from time to time throw in way and the difficulty which have arise from the peculiar and impracticable nature of the indian character the wise humane and undeviate policy of the government in this the most difficult of all relation foreign or domestic have at length be justify to the world in near approach to a happy and certain consummation the condition of the tribe which occupy the country set apart for in the west be highly prosperous and encourage the hope of early civilization have for the most part abandon the hunter state and turn attention to agricultural pursuit all those who have be establish for any length of time in that fertile region maintain by own industry there be among trader of no inconsiderable capital and planter export cotton to some extent but the great number be small agriculturist live in comfort upon the produce of farm the recent emigrant although have in some instance remove reluctantly have readily acquiesce in unavoidable destiny have find at once a recompense for past suffering and an incentive to industrious habit in the abundance and comfort around there be reason to believe that all these tribe be friendly in feeling toward the|united|state and be to be hope that the acquisition of individual wealth the pursuit of agriculture and habit of industry will gradually subdue warlike propensity and incline to maintain peace among to effect this desirable object the attention of congress be solicit to the measure recommend by the secretary of war for future government and protection as well from each other as from the hostility of the warlike tribe around and the intrusion of the white the policy of the government have give a permanent home and guarantee to peaceful and undisturbed possession only remain to give a government and law which will encourage industry and secure to the reward of exertion the importance of some form of government can not be too much insist upon the early effect will be to diminish the cause and occasion for hostility among the tribe to inspire an interest in the observance of law to which will have assent and to multiply the security of property and the motif for self improvement intimately connect with this subject be the establishment of the military defense recommend by the secretary of war which have be already refer to without the government will be powerless to redeem pledge of protection to the emigrate indians against the numerous warlike tribe that surround and to provide for the safety of the frontier settler of the border states the case of the seminoles constitute at present the only exception to the successful effort of the government to remove the indians to the home assign west of the mississippi four|hundre of this tribe emigrate in and in and leave in the country be suppose about|2,000 indians the continued treacherous conduct of these people the savage and unprovoked murder have lately commit butcher whole family of the settler of the territory without distinction of age or sex and make way into the very center and heart of the country so that no part of be free from ravage frequent attack on the light house along that dangerous coast and the barbarity with which have murder the passenger and crew of such vessel as have be wreck upon the reef and key which border the gulf leave the government no alternative but to continue the military operation against until be totally expel from florida there be other motif which would urge the government to pursue this course toward the seminoles the|united|state have fulfil in good faith all treaty stipulation with the indian tribe and have in every other instance insist upon a like performance of obligation to relax from this salutary rule because the seminoles have maintain so long in the territory have relinquish and in defiance of frequent and solemn engagement still continue to wage a ruthless war against the|united|state would not only evince a want of constancy on part but be of evil example in intercourse with other tribe experience have show that but little be to be gain by the march of army through a country so intersect with inaccessible swamp and marsh and which from the fatal character of the climate must be abandon at the|end|of|the|winter recommend therefore to attention the plan submit by the secretary of war in the accompanying report for the permanent occupation of the portion of the territory free from the indians and the more efficient protection of the people of florida from inhuman warfare from the report of the secretary of the navy herewith transmit will appear that a large portion of the disposable naval force be either actively employ or in a state of preparation for the purpose of experience and discipline and the protection of commerce so effectual have be this protection that so far as the information of government extend not a single outrage have be attempt on a vessel carry the flag of the|united|state within the|present|year in any|quarter however distant or expose the explore expedition sail from norfolk on the|19th|of|august last and information have be receive of safe arrival at the island of madeira the good spirit animate the officer and crew and there be every reason to anticipate from effort result beneficial to commerce and honorable to the nation will also be see that no reduction of the force now in commission be contemplate the unsettled state of a portion of render indispensable that commerce should receive protection in that|quarter the vast and increase interest embark in the trade of the indian and china sea in the whale fishery of the|pacific|ocean and in the|gulf|of|mexico require equal attention to safety and a small squadron may be employ to great advantage on atlantic coast in meet sudden demand for the reenforcement of other station in aid merchant vessel in distress in afford active service to an additional number of officer and in visit the different port of the|united|state an accurate knowledge of which be obviously of the high importance the attention of congress be respectfully call to that portion of the report recommend an increase in the number of small vessel and to other suggestion contain in that document the rapid increase and wide expansion of commerce which be every|day seek new avenue of profitable adventure the absolute necessity of a naval force for protection precisely in the degree of extension a due regard to the national right and honor the recollection of former exploit and the anticipation of future triumph whenever opportunity present which may rightfully indulge from the experience of the past all seem to point to the navy as a most efficient arm of national defense and a proper object of legislative encouragement the progress and condition of the|post office|department will be see by reference to the report of the|postmaster general the extent of post - road cover by mail contract be state to be and the annual transportation upon the number of post - office in the|united|state be and rapidly increase the gross revenue for the|year|ending|on|the|30th|day|of|june|last be the accrue expenditure excess of expenditure this have be make up out of the surplus previously on hand the cash on hand on the 1st instant be the revenue for the|year|ending|june|30,|1838 be more than that for the|year|ending|june|30,|1837 the expenditure of the department have be graduate upon the anticipation of a largely increase revenue a moderate curtailment of mail service consequently become necessary and have be effect to shield the department against the danger of embarrassment revenue be now improve and will soon resume onward course in the march of improvement particular attention be request to so much of the|postmaster general report as relate to the transportation of the mail upon railroad the law on that subject do not seem adequate to secure that service now become almost essential to the public interest and at the same time protect the department from combination and unreasonable demand nor can too earnestly request attention to the necessity of provide a more secure building for this department the danger of destruction to which important book and paper be continually expose as well from the highly combustible character of the building occupy as from that of other in the vicinity call loudly for prompt action attention be again earnestly invite to the suggestion and recommendation submit at the last session in respect to the|district|of|columbia feel duty also to bring to notice certain proceeding at law which have recently be prosecute in this district in the name of the|united|state on the relation of messrs. stockton|&|stokes of the|state|of|maryland against the|postmaster general and which have result in the payment of money out of the|national|treasury for the first time since the establishment of the government by judicial compulsion exercise by the common law writ of mandamus issue by the circuit court of this district the fact of the case and the ground of the proceeding will be find fully state in the report of the decision and any additional information which may desire will be supply by the proper department no interference in the particular case be contemplate the money have be pay the claim of the prosecutor have be satisfied and the whole subject so far as be concern be finally dispose of but be on the supposition that the case may be regard as an authoritative exposition of the law as now stand that have think necessary to present to consideration the object of the application to the circuit court be to compel the postmaster general to carry into effect an award make by the solicitor of the treasury under a special act of congress for the settlement of certain claim of the relator on the|post office|department which award the postmaster general decline to execute in full until should receive further legislative direction on the subject if the duty impose on the postmaster general by that law be to be regard as of an official nature belong to office as a branch of the executive then be obvious that the constitutional competency of the judiciary to direct and control in discharge be necessarily draw in question and if the duty so impose on the|postmaster general be to be consider as merely ministerial and not executive yet remain to be show that the circuit court of this district have authority to interfere by mandamus such a power have never before be assert or claim by that court with a view to the settlement of these important question the judgment of the circuit court be carry by a writ of error to the|supreme|court of the|united|state in the opinion of that tribunal the duty impose on the postmaster general be not an official executive duty but of a merely ministerial nature the grave constitutional question which have be discuss be therefore exclude from the decision of the case the court indeed expressly admit that with power and duty properly belong to the executive no other department can inter - fere by the writ of mandamus and the question therefore resolve into this have congress confer upon the circuit court of this district the power to issue such a writ to an officer of the|general|government command to perform a ministerial act a majority of the court have decide that have but have round decision upon a process of reason which in judgment render further legislative provision indispensable to the public interest and the equal administration of justice have long since be decide by the|supreme|court that neither that tribunal nor the circuit court of the|united|state hold within the respective states possess the power in question but be now hold that this power deny to both of these high tribunal to the former by the constitution and to the latter by congress have be by legislation vest in the circuit court of this district no such direct grant of power to the circuit court of this district be claim but have be hold to result by necessary implication from several section of the law establish the court of these section declare that the law of maryland as exist at the time of the cession should be in force in that part of the district cede by that state and by this provision the common law in civil and criminal case as prevail in maryland in be establish in that part of the district in england the court of king 's bench because the sovereign who accord to the theory of the constitution be the fountain of justice originally sit there in person and be still deem to be present in construction of law alone possess the high power of issue the writ of mandamus not only to inferior jurisdiction and corporation but also to magistrate and other command in the king ' s name to do what duty require in case where there be a vested right and no other specific remedy have be hold in the case refer to that as the|supreme|court of the|united|state be by the constitution render incompetent to exercise this power and as the circuit court of this district be a court of general jurisdiction in case at common law and the high court of original jurisdiction in the district the right to issue the writ of mandamus be incident to common law power another ground rely upon to maintain the power in question be that be include by fair construction in the power grant to the circuit court of the|united|state by the act to provide for the more convenient organization of the court of the|united|state pass that the act establish the circuit court of this district pass the|27th|day|of|february,|1801 confer upon that court and the judge thereof the same power as be by law vest in the circuit court of the|united|state and in the judge of the say court that the repeal of the first mention act which take place in the|next|year do not divest the circuit court of this|district|of the authority in dispute but leave still clothe with the power over the subject which be concede be take away from the circuit court of the|united|state by the repeal of admit that the adoption of the law of maryland for a portion of this district confer on the circuit court thereof in that portion the transcendent extrajudicial prerogative power of the court of king 's bench in england or that either of the act of congress by necessary implication authorize the former court to issue a writ of mandamus to an officer of the|united|state to compel to perform a ministerial duty the consequence be in respect the same the result in either case be that the officer of the|united|state station in different part of the|united|state be in respect to the performance of official duty subject to different law and a different supervision those in the states to rule and those in to another and a very different in the district official conduct be subject to a judicial control from which in the states be exempt whatever difference of opinion may exist as to the expediency of vest such a power in the judiciary in a system of government constitute like that of the|united|state all must agree that these disparage discrepancy in the law and in the administration of justice ought not to permit to continue and as congress alone can provide the remedy the subject be unavoidably present to consideration transcript by the president of a proclamation whereas there be too much reason to believe that citizen of the|united|state in disregard to the solemn warning heretofore give to by the proclamation issue by the|executive|of|the|general|government and by some of the governor of the states have combine to disturb the peace of the dominion of a neighboring and friendly nation and whereas information have be give to derive from official and other source that many citizen in different part of the|united|state be associate or associate for the same purpose and whereas disturbance have actually break out anew in different part of the canadas and whereas a hostile invasion have be make by citizen of the|united|state in conjunction with canadians and other who after forcibly seize upon the property of peaceful neighbor for the purpose of effect unlawful design be now in arm against the authority of canada in perfect disregard of obligation as american citizen and of the obligation of the government of country to foreign nation now therefore have think necessary and proper to issue this proclamation call upon every citizen of the|united|state neither to give countenance nor encouragement of any kind to those who have thus forfeit claim to the protection of country upon those misguided or delude person who be engage in to abandon project dangerous to own country fatal to those whom profess a desire to relieve impracticable of execution without foreign aid which can not rationally expect to obtain and give rise to imputation however unfounded upon the honor and good faith of own government upon every officer civil or military and upon every citizen by the veneration due by all freeman to the law which have assist to enact for own government by regard for the honor and reputation of country by love of order and respect for the sacred code of law by which national intercourse be regulate to use every effort in power to arrest for trial and punishment every offender against the law provide for the performance of obligation to the other power of the world and hereby warn all those who have engage in these criminal enterprise if persist in that whatever may be the condition to which may be reduce must not expect the interference of this government in any form on behalf but will be leave reproach by every virtuous fellow citizen to be deal with accord to the policy and justice of that government whose dominion have in defiance of the know wish of own government and without the shadow of justification or excuse nefariously invade give under hand at the city of washington the|21st|day|of|november and the third of the independence of the|united|state m.|van|buren by the president

instruction have be give to the united|states officer on that frontier and application have be make to the governor of the adjoin states to prevent any unlawful interference on the part of citizen in the contest unfortunately commence in the|british|province additional information have just be receive that notwithstanding the proclamation of the governor of the|states|of|new|york and vermont exhort citizen to refrain from any unlawful act within the territory of the|united|state and notwithstanding the presence of the civil officer of the|united|state who by direction have visit the scene of commotion with a view of impress the citizen with a proper sense of duty the excitement instead of be appease be every day increase in degree that arm and munition of war and other supply have be

observe martin|van|buren do most earnestly exhort all citizen of the|united|state who have thus violate duty to return peaceably to respective home and hereby warn that any person who shall compromit the neutrality of this government by interfere in an unlawful manner with the affair of the neighboring british|province will render liable to arrest and punishment under the law of the|united|state

have ever be desire to cultivate of pende question the most important be that which exist with the|government|of|great|britain in respect to northeastern boundary be with unfeigned regret that the people of the|united|state must look back upon the abortive effort make by the executive for a period of more than half a century to determine what no nation should suffer long to remain in dispute the true line which divide possession from those of other power the nature of the settlement on the border of the|united|state and of the neighboring territory be for a season such that this perhaps be not indispensable to a faithful performance of the duty of the|federal|government time have however change this state of thing and have bring about a condition of affair in which the true interest

apparently as far from adjustment as be at the time of sign the treaty of peace in the sole result of long pende negotiation and a perplex arbitration appear to be a conviction on part that a conventional line must be adopt from the impossibility of ascertain the true one accord to the description contain in that treaty without coincide in this opinion which be not think to be well round predecessor give the strong proof of the earnest desire of the|united|state to terminate satisfactorily this dispute by propose the substitution of a conventional line if the consent of the states

the discriminate duty upon the produce of portugal import into this country in portuguese vessel be pass upon the application of that government through representative here under the belief that no similar discrimination exist in portugal to the prejudice of the|united|state regret to state that such duty be now exact in that country upon the cargo of american vessel and as the act refer to vest no discretion in the executive be for congress to determine upon the expediency of further legislation on the subject against these discrimination affect the vessel of this country and cargo seasonable remonstrance be make and notice be give to the|portuguese|government that unless should be discontinue the adoption of countervail measure on the part of the|united|state would become necessary but the reply of that government receive at the|department|of|state through charge d'affaire at lisbon in afford no ground to hope for the abandonment of a system so little in harmony with the treatment show to the vessel of portugal and cargo in the port of this country and so contrary to the expectation have a right to entertain with holland sweden denmark naples and belgium a

congratulate on the prospect of considerable commercial benefit and have besides receive from the sultan of muscat prompt evidence of desire to cultivate the most friendly feeling by liberal act toward of vessel bestow in a manner so striking as to require on part a grateful acknowledgment commerce with the island of cuba and porto|rico still labor under heavy restriction the continuance of

continent have ever since emerge from the colonial state experience severe trial in progress to the permanent establishment of liberal political institution unsettled condition not only interrupt own advance to prosperity but have often seriously injure the other power of the world the claim of citizen upon peru chili brazil the government form out of the|republics|of|colombia and mexico be still pende although many of have be present for examination more|than|twenty|year new|granada venezuela and ecuador have recently form a convention for the purpose of ascertaining and adjust claim upon the|republic|of|colombia from which be earnestly hope citizen will ere long receive full compensation for the injury inflict upon and for the delay in afford an advantageous treaty of commerce have be conclude by the|united|state with the|peru bolivian|confederation which want only the ratification of that government the progress of a subsequent negotiation for the settlement of claim upon peru have be unfavorably affect by the war between that power and chili and the|argentine|republic and the same event be also likely to produce delay in the settlement of out demand on those power the aggravate circumstance connect with claim upon mexico and a variety of event touch the honor and integrity of government lead predecessor to make at the second session of the last congress a special recommendation of the course to be pursue to obtain a speedy and final satisfaction of the injury complain of by this government and by citizen recommend a final demand of redress with a contingent authority to the executive to make reprisal if that demand should be make in vain from the proceeding of congress on that recommendation appear that the opinion of both branch of the legislature coincide with that of the executive that any mode of redress know to the law of nation may justifiably be use be obvious too that congress believe with the president that another demand should be make in order to give undeniable and satisfactory proof of desire to avoid extremity with a neighboring power but that there be an indisposition to vest a discretionary authority in the executive to take redress should unfortunately be either deny or unreasonably delay by the|mexican|government so soon as the necessary document be prepare after enter upon the duty of office a special messenger be send to mexico to make a final demand of redress with the document require by the provision of treaty the demand be make on the|20th|of|july last the reply which bear date the 29th of the|same|month contain assurance of a desire on the part of that government to give a prompt and explicit answer respect each of the complaint but that the examination of would necessarily be deliberate that in this examination would be guide by the principle of public law and the obligation of treaty that nothing should be leave undone that may lead to the most speedy and equitable adjustment of demand and that determination in respect to each case should be communicate through the mexican minister here since that time an envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary have be accredit to this government by that of bring with assurance of a sincere desire that the pende difference between the government should be terminate in a manner satisfactory to both be receive with reciprocal assurance and a hope be entertain that mission would lead to a speedy satisfactory and final adjustment of all exist subject of complaint a sincere believer in the wisdom of the pacific policy by which the|united|state have always be govern in intercourse with foreign nation be particular desire from the proximity of and well know occurrence on frontier to be instrumental in obviate all exist difficulty with that government and in restore to the intercourse between the republics that liberal and friendly character by which should always be distinguish regret therefore the more deeply to have find in the recent communication of that government so little reason to hope that any future effort of for the accomplishment of those desirable object would be successful although the large number and many of aggravate case of personal wrong have be now for year before the|mexican|government and some of the cause of national complaint and those of the most offensive character admit of immediate simple and satisfactory reply be only within a|few|day past that any specific communication in answer to last demand make have be receive from the mexican minister by the report of the secretary of state herewith present and the accompany document will be see that for not of public complaint have satisfaction be give or offer that but of the case of personal wrong have be favorably consider and that but case of both description out of all those formally present and earnestly press have as yet be decide upon by the|mexican|government not perceive in what manner any of the power give to the executive alone could be further usefully employ in bring this unfortunate controversy to a satisfactory termination the subject be by predecessor refer to congress as call for interposition in accordance with the clearly understand wish of the legislature another and formal demand for satisfaction have be make upon the|mexican|government with what success the document now communicate will show on a careful and deliberate examination of content and consider the spirit manifest by the|mexican|government have become painful duty to return the subject as now stand to congress to whom belong to decide upon the time the mode and the measure of redress whatever may be decision shall be faithfully execute confident that will be characterize by that moderation and justice which will trust under all circumstance govern the council of country the balance in the treasury on be the receipt during the|present|year from all source include the amount of treasury note issue be estimate at constitute an aggregate of of this amount about|$35,281,361 will have be expend at the|end|of|the|year on appropriation make by congress and the residue amount to will be the nominal balance in the treasury on the|1st|of|january next but of that sum only|$1,085,498 be consider as immediately available for and applicable to public purpose those portion of which will be for some time unavailable consist chiefly of sum deposit with the states and due from the former deposit bank the detail upon this subject will be find in the annual report of the secretary of the treasury the amount of treasury note which will be necessary to issue during the|year on account of those fund be unavailable will be suppose not exceed four|and|a|half|million seem proper in the condition of the country to have the estimate on all subject make as low as practicable without prejudice to any great public measure the departments be therefore desire to prepare estimate accordingly and be happy to find that have be able to graduate on so economical a scale in the great and often unexpected fluctuation to which the revenue be subject be not possible to compute the receipt beforehand with great certainty but should not differ essentially from present anticipation and should the appropriation not much exceed the estimate no difficulty seem likely to happen in defray the current expense with promptitude and fidelity notwithstanding the great embarrassment which have recently occur in commercial affair and the liberal indulgence which in consequence of these embarrassment have be extend to both the merchant and the bank be gratify to be able to anticipate that the treasury note which have be issue during the|present|year will be redeem and that the resource of the treasury without any resort to loan or increase taxis will prove ample for defray all charge impose on during the report of the secretary of the treasury will afford a more minute exposition of all matter connect with the administration of the finance during the|current|year a period which for the amount of public money disburse and deposit with the states as well as the financial difficulty encounter and overcome have few parallel in history attention be at the last session invite to the necessity of additional legislative provision in respect to the collection safe keeping and transfer of the public money no law have be then mature and not understand the proceeding of congress as intend to be final become duty again to bring the subject to notice on that occasion mode of perform this branch of the public service be present for consideration these be the creation of a national bank the revival with modification of the deposit system establish by the act of the|23d|of|june,|1836 permit the use of the public money by the bank and the discontinuance of the use of such institution for the purpose refer to with suitable provision for accomplishment through the agency of public officer consider the opinion of both houses|of|congress on the first proposition as express in the negative in which entirely concur be unnecessary for again in to recur to in respect to the last have have an opportunity since adjournment not only to test still further the expediency of the measure by the continue practical operation of such part of as be now in force but also to discover what should ever be seek for and regard with the utmost deference the opinion and wish of the people the national will be the supreme law of the republic and on all subject within the limit of constitutional power should be faithfully obey by the public servant since the measure in question be submit to consideration most of have enjoy the advantage of personal communication with constituent for state only have an election be hold for the|federal|government but the|early|day at which take place deprive the measure under consideration of much of the support may otherwise have derive from the result local election for state officer have however be hold in several of the|state at which the expediency of the plan propose by the executive have be more or less discuss will be confident yield to result the respect due to every expression of the public voice desiring however to arrive at truth and a just view of the subject in all bearing will at the same time remember that question of far deep and more immediate local interest than the fiscal plan of the|national|treasury be involve in those election above all can not overlook the striking fact that there be at the time in those states more|than|one|hundred|and|sixty|millions of bank capital of which large portion be subject to actual forfeiture other large portion uphold only by special and limited legislative indulgence and most of if not all to a great or less extent dependent for a continuance of corporate existence upon the will of the state legislature to be then choose apprise of this circumstance will judge whether be not most probable that the peculiar condition of that vast interest in these respect the extent to which have be spread through all the ramification of society direct connection with the then pende election and the feeling be calculate to infuse into the canvass have exercise a far great influence over the result than any which could possibly have be produce by a conflict of opinion in respect to a question in the administration of the|general|government more remote and far less important in bearing upon that interest have find no reason to change own opinion as to the expediency of adopt the system propose be perfectly satisfied that there will be neither stability nor safety either in the fiscal affair of the government or in the pecuniary transaction of individual and corporation so long as a connection exist between which like the past offer such strong inducement to make the subject of political agitation indeed be more than ever convince of the danger to which the free and unbiased exercise of political opinion the only sure foundation and safeguard of republican government would be expose by any further increase of the already overgrow influence of corporate authority can not therefore consistently with view of duty advise a renewal of a connection which circumstance have dissolve the discontinuance of the use of state bank for fiscal purpose ought not to be regard as a measure of hostility toward those institution bank properly establish and conduct be highly useful to the business of the country and will doubtless continue to exist in the states so long as conform to law and be find to be safe and beneficial how should be create what privilege should enjoy under what responsibility should act and to what restriction should be subject be question which as observe on a previous occasion belong to the states to decide upon right or the exercise of can have no motive to encroach duty toward be well perform when refrain from legislate for special benefit because such legislation would violate the spirit of the constitution and be unjust to other interest when take no step to impair usefulness but so manage own affair as to make the interest of those institution to strengthen and improve condition for the security and welfare of the community at large have no right to insist on a connection with the|federal|government nor on the use of the public money for own benefit the object of the measure under consideration be to avoid for the future a compulsory connection of this kind propose to place the|general|government in regard to the essential point of the collection safe keeping and transfer of the public money in a situation which shall relieve from all dependence on the will of irresponsible individual or corporation to withdraw those money from the us of private trade and confide to agent constitutionally select and control by law to abstain from improper interference with the industry of the people and withhold inducement to improvident dealing on the part of individual to give stability to the concern of the treasury to preserve the measure of the government from the unavoidable reproach that flow from such a connection and the bank from the injurious effect of a suppose participation in the political conflict of the|day from which will otherwise find difficult to escape these be view upon this important subject form after careful reflection and with no desire but to arrive at what be most likely to promote the public interest be now as be before submit with unfeigned deference for the opinion of other be hardly to be hope that change so important on a subject so interesting could be make without produce a serious diversity of opinion but so long as those conflicting view be keep above the influence of individual or local interest so long as pursue only the general good and be discuss with moderation and candor such diversity be a benefit not an injury if a majority of congress see the public welfare in a different light and more especially if should be satisfied that the measure propose would not be acceptable to the people shall look to wisdom to substitute such as may be more conducive to the and more satisfactory to the other in any event may confidently rely on hearty cooperation to the full extent to which view of the constitution and sense of duty will permit be obviously important to this branch of the public service and to the business and quiet of the country that the whole subject should in some way be settle and regulate by law and if possible at present session besides the plan above refer to be not aware that any one have be suggest except that of keep the public money in the state bank in special deposit this plan be to some extent in accordance with the practice of the government and with the present arrangement of the|treasury|department which except perhaps during the operation of the late deposit act have always be allow even during the existence of a national bank to make a temporary use of the state bank in particular place for the safe keeping of portion of the revenue this discretionary power may be continue if congress deem desirable whatever general system be adopt so long as the connection be voluntary need perhaps anticipate few of those difficulty and little of that dependence on the bank which must attend every such connection when compulsory in nature and when so arrange as to make the bank a fix part of the machinery of government be undoubtedly in the power of congress so to regulate and guard as to prevent the public money from be apply to the use or intermingle with the affair of individual thus arrange although would not give to the government that entire control over own fund which desire to secure to by the plan have propose would must be admit in a great degree accomplish of the object which have recommend that plan to judgment the separation of the fiscal concern of the government from those of individual or corporation with these observation recommend the whole matter to dispassionate reflection confidently hope that some conclusion may be reach by deliberation which on the hand shall give safety and stability to the fiscal operation of the government and be consistent on the other with the genius of institution and with the interest and wish of the great mass of constituent be hope that nothing would occur to make necessary on this occasion any allusion to the late national bank there be circumstance however connect with the present state of affair that bear so directly on the character of the government and the welfare of the citizen that should not feel excuse in neglect to notice the charter which terminate banking privilege on the|4th|of|march,|1836 continue corporate power two|year more for the sole purpose of close affair with authority to use the corporate name style and capacity for the purpose of suit for a final settlement and liquidation of the affair and act of the corporation and for the sale and disposition of estate real personal and mixed but for no other purpose or in any other manner whatsoever just before the banking privilege cease effect be transfer by the bank to a new state institution then recently incorporate in trust for the discharge of debt and the settlement of affair with this trustee by authority of congress an adjustment be subsequently make of the large interest which the government have in the stock of the institution the manner in which a trust unexpectedly create upon the act grant the charter and involve such great public interest have be execute would under any circumstance be a fit subject of inquiry but much more do deserve attention when embrace the redemption of obligation to which the authority and credit of the|united|state have give value the|two|year allow be now nearly at an end be well understand that the trustee have not redeem and cancel the outstanding note of the bank but have reissue and be actually reissue since the|3d|of|march,|1836 the note which have be receive by to a vast amount accord to own official statement so late as the after- the banking privilege give by the charter have expire have under control uncanceled note of the late bank|of|the|united|state to the amount of of which be in actual circulation at state bank agency and in transitu thus show that upward of of the note of the old bank be then still keep outstanding the impropriety of this procedure be obvious be the duty of the trustee to cancel and not to put forth the note of an institution whose concern have undertake to wind up if the trustee have a right to reissue these note now can see no reason why may not continue to do so after the expiration of the|two|year as no one could have anticipate a course so extraordinary the prohibitory clause of the charter above quote be not accompany by any penalty or other special provision for enforce nor have any general law for the prevention of similar act in future but be not in this view of the subject alone that interposition be require the|united|state in settle with the trustee for stock have withdraw fund from former direct liability to the creditor of the old bank yet note of the institution continue to be send forth in name and apparently upon the authority of the|united|state the transaction connect with the employment of the bill of the old bank be of vast extent and should result unfortunately the interest of individual may be deeply compromise without undertake to decide how far or in what form if any the trustee could be make liable for note which contain no obligation on part or the old bank for such as be put in circulation after the expiration of charter and without authority or the government for indemnity in case of loss the question still press upon consideration whether be consistent with duty and good faith on the part of the government to witness this proceeding without a single effort to arrest the report of the commissioner of the|general|land|office which will be lay before by the secretary of the treasury will show how the affair of that office have be conduct for the|past|year the disposition of the public land be of the most important trust confide to congress the practicability of retain the title and control of such extensive domain in the|general|government and at the same time admit the territories embrace into the|federal|union as coequal with the original states be seriously doubt by many of wise statesman all fear that would become a source of discord and many carry apprehension so far as to see in the seed of a future dissolution of the confederacy but happily experience have already be sufficient to quiet in a great degree all such apprehension the position at time assume that the admission of new states into the union on the same footing with the original states be incompatible with a right of soil in the|united|state and operate as a surrender thereof notwithstanding the term of the compact by which admission be design to be regulate have be wisely abandon whether in the new or the old states all now agree that the right of soil to the public land remain in the|federal|government and that these land constitute a common property to be dispose of for the common benefit of all the states old and new acquiescence in this just principle by the people of the new states have naturally promote a disposition to adopt the most liberal policy in the sale of the public land a policy which should be limit to the mere object of sell the land for the great possible sum of money without regard to high consideration find but few advocate on the contrary be generally concede that whilst the mode of disposition adopt by the government should always be a prudent one yet lead object ought to be the early settlement and cultivation of the land sell and that should discountenance if can not prevent the accumulation of large tract in the same hand which must necessarily retard the growth of the new states or entail upon a dependent tenantry and attendant evil a question embrace such important interest and so well calculated to enlist the feeling of the people in every quarter of the union have very naturally give rise to numerous plan for the improvement of the exist system the distinctive feature of the policy that have hitherto prevail be to dispose of the public land at moderate price thus enable a great number to enter into competition for purchase and accomplish a double object of promote rapid settlement by the purchaser and at the same time increase the receipt of the treasury to sell for cash thereby prevent the disturbing influence of a large mass of private citizen indebte to the government which have a voice in control to bring into market no faster than good land be suppose to be want for improvement thereby prevent the accumulation of large tract in few hand and to apply the proceed of the sale to the general purpose of the government thus diminish the amount to be raise from the people of the states by taxation and give each state portion of the benefit to be derive from this common fund in a manner the most quiet and at the same time perhaps the most equitable that can be devise these provision with occasional enactment in behalf of special interest deem entitle to the favor of the government have in execution produce result as beneficial upon the whole as could reasonably be expect in a matter so vast so complicated and so exciting upward of have be sell the great part of which be believe to have be purchase for actual settlement the population of the new states and territories create out of the public domain increase between|1800|and|1830 from less|than|60,000 to upward of soul constitute at the latter period about|one fifth of the whole people of the|united|state the increase since can not be accurately know but the whole may now be safely estimate at over three|and|a|half|million of soul compose nine|states the representative of which constitute above|one third of the senate and over|one sixth of the|house|of|representatives of the|united|state thus have be form a body of free and independent landholder with a rapidity unequale in the history of mankind and this great result have be produce without leave anything for future adjustment between the government and citizen the system under which so much have be accomplish can not be intrinsically bad and with occasional modification to correct abuse and adapt to change of circumstance may think be safely trust for the future there be in the management of such extensive interest much virtue in stability and although great and obvious improvement should not be decline change should never be make without the full examination and the clear demonstration of practical utility in the history of the past have an assurance that this safe rule of action will not be depart from in relation to the public land nor be believe that any necessity exist for interfere with the fundamental principle of the system or that the public mind even in the new states be desirous of any radical alteration on the contrary the general disposition appear to be to make such modification and addition only as will the more effectually carry out the original policy of fill new states and territories with an industrious and independent population the modification most perseveringly press upon congress which have occupy so much of time for year past and will probably do so for a long time to come if not sooner satisfactorily adjust be a reduction in the cost of such portion of the public land as be ascertain to be unsalable at the rate now establish by law and a graduation accord to relative value of the price at which may hereafter be sell be worthy of consideration whether justice may not be do to every interest in this matter and a vexed question set at rest perhaps forever by a reasonable compromise of conflict opinion hitherto after be offer at public sale land have be dispose of at uniform price whatever difference there may be in intrinsic value the lead consideration urge in favor of the measure refer to be that in almost all the land district and particularly in those in which the land have be long survey and expose to sale there be still remain numerous and large tract of every gradation of value from the government price downward that these land will not be purchase at the government price so long as well can be conveniently obtain for the same amount that there be large tract which even the improvement of the adjacent land will never raise to that price and that the present uniform price combine with irregular value operate to prevent a desirable compactness of settlement in the new states and to retard the full development of that wise policy on which land system be found to the injury not only of the several states where the land lie but of the|united|state as a whole the remedy propose have be a reduction of the price accord to the length of time the land have be in market without reference to any other circumstance the certainty that the efflux of time would not always in such case and perhaps not even generally furnish a true criterion of value and the probability that person reside in the vicinity as the period for the reduction of price approach would postpone purchase would otherwise make for the purpose of avail of the low price with other consideration of a similar character have hitherto be successfully urge to defeat the graduation upon time may not all reasonable desire upon this subject be satisfied without encounter any of these objection all will concede the abstract principle that the price of the public land should be proportion to relative value so far as can be accomplish without depart from the rule heretofore observe require fix price in case of private entry the difficulty of the subject seem to lie in the mode of ascertain what that value be would not the safe plan be that which have be adopt by many of the states as the basis of taxation an actual valuation of land and classification of into different rate would not be practicable and expedient to cause the relative value of the public land in the old district which have be for a certain length of time in market to be appraise and class into or more rate below the present minimum price by the officer now employ in this branch of the public service or in any other mode deem preferable and to make those price permanent if upon the come in of the report shall prove satisfactory to congress could not all the object of graduation be accomplish in this way and the objection which have hitherto be urge against avoid would seem to that such a step with a restriction of the sale to limited quantity and for actual improvement would be free from all just exception by the full exposition of the value of the land thus furnished and extensively promulgated person live at a distance would be inform of true condition and enable to enter into competition with those reside in the vicinity the mean of acquire an independent home would be bring within the reach of many who be unable to purchase at present price the population of the new states would be make more compact and large tract would be sell which would otherwise remain on hand not only would the land be bring within the mean of a large number of purchaser but many person possess of great mean would be content to settle on a large quantity of the poor land rather than emigrate farther west in pursuit of a small quantity of well land such a measure would also seem to be more consistent with the policy of the exist law that of convert the public domain into cultivate farm own by occupant that policy be not best promote by send emigration up the almost interminable stream of the west to occupy in group the good spot of land leave immense waste behind and enlarge the frontier beyond the mean of the government to afford adequate protection but in encourage to occupy with reasonable denseness the territory over which advance and find good defense in the compact front which present to the indian tribe many of will bring to the consideration of the subject the advantage of local knowledge and great experience and all will be desirous of make an early and final disposition of every disturbing question in regard to this important interest if these suggestion shall in any degree contribute to the accomplishment of so important a result will afford sincere satisfaction in some section of the country most of the public land have be sell and the register and receiver have very little to do be a subject worthy of inquiry whether in many case or more district may not be consolidate and the number of person employ in this business considerably reduce indeed the time will come when will be the true policy of the|general|government as to some of the states to transfer to for a reasonable equivalent all the refuse and unsold land and to withdraw the machinery of the federal land office altogether all who take a comprehensive view of federal system and believe that of great excellency consist in interfere as little as possible with the internal concern of the states look forward with great interest to this result a modification of the exist law in respect to the price of the public land may also have a favorable influence on the legislation of congress in relation to another branch of the subject many who have not the ability to buy at present price settle on those land with the hope of acquire from cultivation the mean of purchase under preemption law from time to time pass by congress for this encroachment on the right of the|united|state excuse under the plea of own necessity the fact that dispossess nobody and only enter upon the waste domain that give additional value to the public land in vicinity and intention ultimately to pay the government price so much weight have from time to time be attach to these consideration that congress have pass law give actual settler on the public land a right of preemption to the tract occupy by at the minimum price these law have in all instance be retrospective in operation but in a|few|year after passage crowd of new settler have be find on the public land for similar reason and under like expectation who have be indulge with the same privilege this course of legislation tend to impair public respect for the law of the country either the law to prevent intrusion upon the public land should be execute or if that should be impracticable or inexpedient should be modify or repeal if the public land be to be consider as open to be occupy by any should by law be throw open to all that which be intend in all instance to be legalize should at once be make legal that those who be dispose to conform to the law may enjoy at least equal privilege with those who be not but be not believe to be the disposition of congress to open the public land to occupancy without regular entry and payment of the government price as such a course must tend to bad evil than the credit system which be find necessary to abolish would seem therefore to be the part of wisdom and sound policy to remove as far as practicable the cause which produce intrusion upon the public land and then take efficient step to prevent in future would any single measure be so effective in remove all plausible ground for these intrusion as the graduation of price already suggest a short period of industry and economy in any part of country would enable the poor citizen to accumulate the mean to buy a home at the low price and leave without apology for settle on land not own if do not under such circumstance would enlist no sympathy in favor and the law would be readily execute without do violence to public opinion a large portion of citizen have seat on the public land without authority since the passage of the last preemption law and now ask the enactment of another to enable to retain the land occupy upon payment of the minimum government price ask that which have be repeatedly grant before if the future may be judge of by the past little harm can be do to the interest of the treasury by yield to request upon a critical examination be find that the land sell at the public sale since the introduction of cash payment in have produce on an average the net revenue of only|6|cent an acre more than the minimum government price there be no reason to suppose that future sale will be more productive the government therefore have no adequate pecuniary interest to induce to drive these people from the land occupy for the purpose of sell to other entertain these view recommend the passage of a preemption law for benefit in connection with the preparatory step toward the graduation of the price of the public land and further and more effectual provision to prevent intrusion hereafter indulgence to those who have settle on these land with expectation that past legislation would be make a rule for the future and at the same time remove the most plausible ground on which intrusion be excuse and adopt more efficient mean to prevent hereafter appear to the most judicious disposition which can be make of this difficult subject the limitation and restriction to guard against abuse in the execution of a preemption law will necessarily attract the careful attention of congress but under no circumstance be consider expedient to authorize float claim in any shape have be heretofore and doubtless would be hereafter most prolific source of fraud and oppression and instead of operate to confer the favor of the government on industrious settler be often use only to minister to a spirit of cupidity at the expense of the most meritorious of that class the accompanying report of the secretary of war will bring to view the state of the army and all the various subject confide to the superintendence of that officer the principal part of the army have be concentrate in florida with a view and in the expectation of bring the war in that territory to a speedy close the necessity of strip the post on the maritime and inland frontier of entire garrison for the purpose of assemble in the field an army of less|than|4,000 man would seem to indicate the necessity of increase regular force and the superior efficiency as well as greatly diminish expense of that description of troop recommend this measure as of economy as well as of expediency refer to the report for the reason which have induce the secretary of war to urge the reorganization and enlargement of the staff of the army and of the|ordnance|corps in which fully concur be not however compatible with the interest of the people to maintain in time of peace a regular force adequate to the defense of extensive frontier in period of danger and alarm must rely principally upon a well organize militia and some general arrangement that will render this description of force more efficient have long be a subject of anxious solicitude be recommend to the|first|congress by general|washington and have be since frequently bring to notice and recently importance strongly urge by immediate predecessor the provision in the constitution that render necessary to adopt a uniform system of organization for the militia throughout the|united|state present an insurmountable obstacle to an efficient arrangement by the classification heretofore propose and invite attention to the plan which will be submit by the secretary of war for the organization of volunteer corp and the instruction of militia officer as more simple and practicable if not equally advantageous as a general arrangement of the whole militia of the|united|state a moderate increase of the corps both of military and topographical engineer have be more than once recommend by predecessor and conviction of the propriety not to say necessity of the measure in order to enable to perform the various and important duty impose upon induce to repeat the recommendation the|military|academy continue to answer all the purpose of establishment and not only furnish well educate officer to the army but serve to diffuse throughout the mass of citizen individual possess of military knowledge and the scientific attainment of civil and military engineering at present the cadet be bind with consent of parent or guardian to remain in service five|year from the period of enlistment unless sooner discharge thus exact only|one|year 's service in the army after education be complete this do not appear to sufficient government ought to command for a long period the service of those who be educate at the public expense and recommend that the time of enlistment be extend to seven|year and the term of the engagement strictly enforce the creation of a national foundry for cannon to be common to the service of the army and navy of the|united|state have be heretofore recommend and appear to be require in order to place ordnance on an equal footing with that of other country and to enable that branch of the service to control the price of those article and graduate the supply to the want of the government as well as to regulate quality and insure uniformity the same reason induce to recommend the erection of a manufactory of gunpowder to be under the direction of the|ordnance|office the establishment of a manufactory of small arm west of upon the plan propose by the secretary of|war will contribute to extend throughout that country the improvement which exist in establishment of a similar description in the|atlantic|state and tend to a much more economical distribution of the armament require in the western portion of union the system of remove the indians west of the mississippi commence by mr. jefferson in have be steadily persevere in by every succeed president and may be consider the settle policy of the country unconnecte at first with any well define system for improvement the inducement hold out to the indians be confine to the great abundance of game to be find in the west but when the beneficial effect of removal be make apparent a more philanthropic and enlighten policy be adopt in purchase land east of the mississippi liberal price be give and provision insert in all the treaty with for the application of the fund receive in exchange to such purpose as be best calculate to promote present welfare and advance future civilization these measure have be attend thus far with the happy result will be see by refer to the report of the commissioner of indian|affairs that the most sanguine expectation of the friend and promoter of this system have be realize the choctaws cherokees and other tribe that first emigrate beyond the mississippi have for the most part abandon the hunter state and become cultivator of the soil the improvement in condition have be rapid and be believe that be now fit to enjoy the advantage of a simple form of government which have be submit to and receive sanction and can not too strongly urge this subject upon the attention of congress stipulation have be make with all the indian tribe to remove beyond the mississippi except with the band of the wyandots the|six|nations in new|york the and stockbridges in wisconsin and miamies in indiana with all but the menomonees be expect that arrangement for emigration will be complete the|present|year the resistance which have be oppose to removal by some of the tribe even after treaty have be make with to that effect have arise from various cause operate differently on each of in most instance have be instigate to resistance by person to whom the trade with and the acquisition of annuity be important and in some by the personal influence of interested chief these obstacle must be overcome for the government can not relinquish the execution of this policy without sacrifice important interest and abandon the tribe remain east of the mississippi to certain destruction the decrease in number of the tribe within the limit of the states and territories have be most rapid if be remove can be protect from those association and evil practice which exert so pernicious and destructive an influence over destiny can be induce to labor and to acquire property and acquisition will inspire with a feeling of independence mind can be cultivate and can be teach the value of salutary and uniform law and be make sensible of the blessing of free government and capable of enjoy advantage in the possession of property knowledge and a good government free to give what direction please to labor and sharer in the legislation by which person and the profit of industry be to be protect and secure will have an ever present conviction ot the importance of union and peace among and of the preservation of amicable relation with the interest of the|united|state would also be greatly promote by free the relation between the general and state governments from what have prove a most embarrassing incumbrance by a satisfactory adjustment of conflict title to land cause by the occupation of the indians and by cause the resource of the whole country to be develop by the power of the state and general|governments and improve by the enterprise of a white population intimately connect with this subject be the obligation of the government to fulfill treaty stipulation and to protect the indians thus assemble at new residence from all interruption and disturbance from any other tribe or nation of indians or from any other person or person whatsoever and the equally solemn obligation to guard from indian hostility own border settlement stretch along a line of more|than|1,000|mile to enable the government to redeem this pledge to the indians and to afford adequate protection to own citizen will require the continual presence of a considerable regular force on the frontier and the establishment of a chain of permanent post examination of the country be now make with a view to decide on the most suitable point for the erection of fortress and other work of defense the result of which will be present to by the secretary of war at an|early|day together with a plan for the effectual protection of the friendly indians and the permanent defense of the frontier states by the report of the secretary of the navy herewith communicate appear that unremitted exertion have be make at the different navy yard to carry into effect all authorize measure for the extension and employment of naval force the launching and preparation of the ship of the line pennsylvania and the complete repair of the ship of the line ohio delaware and columbus may be notice as form a respectable addition to this important arm of national defense commerce and navigation have receive increase aid and protection during the|present|year squadron in the pacific and on the brazilian station have be much increase and that in the mediterranean although small be adequate to the present want of commerce in that sea addition have be make to squadron on the west|india station where the large force under commodore dallas have be most actively and efficiently employ in protect commerce in prevent the importation of slave and in cooperate with the officer of the army in carry on the war in florida the satisfactory condition of naval force abroad leave at disposal the mean of conveniently provide for a home squadron for the protection of commerce upon extensive coast the amount of appropriation require for such a squadron will be find in the general estimate for the naval service for the|year|1838 the naval officer engage upon coast survey have render important service to navigation the discovery of a new channel into the harbor of new|york through which large ship may pass without danger must afford important commercial advantage to that harbor and add greatly to value as a naval station the accurate survey of georges|shoal off the coast of massachusetts lately complete will render comparatively safe a navigation hitherto consider dangerous considerable addition have be make to the number of captain commander lieutenant surgeon and assistant surgeon in the navy these addition be render necessary by the increase number of vessel put in commission to answer the exigency of grow commerce attention be respectfully invite to the various suggestion of the secretary for the improvement of the naval service the report of the postmaster general exhibit the progress and condition of the mail service the operation of the|post office|department constitute of the most active element of national prosperity and be gratify to observe with what vigor be conduct the mail route of the|united|state cover an extent of about|142,877|mile have be increase about|37,103|mile within the|last|two|year the annual mail transportation on these route be have be increase within the same period the number of post - office have also be increase from to very few of which receive the mail less than once a week and a large portion of daily contractor and postmaster in general be represent as attend to duty with most commendable zeal and fidelity the revenue of the department within the|year|ending|on|the|30th|of|june|last be and liability accrue within the same time be the increase of revenue over that of the|preceding|year be for many interesting detail refer to the report of the|postmaster general with the accompany paper particular attention be invite to the necessity of provide a more safe and convenient building for the accommodation of that department lie before congress copy of report submit in pursuance of a call make by upon the head of departments for such suggestion as experience may enable to make as to what further legislative provision may be advantageously adopt to secure the faithful application of public money to the object for which be appropriate to prevent misapplication or embezzlement by those intrust with the expenditure of and generally to increase the security of the government against loss in disbursement be needless to dilate on the importance of provide such new safeguard as be within the power of legislation to promote these end and have little to add to the recommendation submit in the accompany paper by law the term of service of most important collecting and disburse officer in the civil department be limit to four|years and when reappointe bond be require to be renew the safety of the public be much increase by this feature of the law and there can be no doubt that application to all officer intrust with the collection or disbursement of the public money whatever may be the tenure of office would be equally beneficial therefore recommend in addition to such of the suggestion present by the head of departments as may think useful a general provision that all officer of the army or navy or in the civil department intrust with the receipt or payment of public money and whose term of service be either unlimited or for a long time than four|years be require to give new bond with good and sufficient surety at the expiration of every such period a change in the period of terminate the|fiscal|year from the|1st|of|october|to|the|1st|of|april have be frequently recommend and appear to be desirable the distress casualty in steamboat which have so frequently happen during the|year seem to evince the necessity of attempt to prevent by mean of severe provision connect with customhouse paper this subject be submit to the attention of congress by the secretary of the treasury in last annual report and will be again notice at the present session with additional detail will doubtless receive that early and careful consideration which press importance appear to require attention have heretofore be frequently call to the affair of the|district|of|columbia and should not again ask do not entire dependence on congress give a constant claim upon notice separate by the constitution from the rest of the union limit in extent and aid by no legislature of own would seem to be a spot where a wise and uniform system of local government may have be easily adopt this district have however unfortunately be leave to linger behind the rest of the union code civil and criminal be not only very defective but full of obsolete or inconvenient provision be form of portion of states discrepancy in the law prevail in different part of the territory small as be and although be select as the seat of the|general|government the site of public edifice the depository of archive and the residence of officer intrust with large amount of public property and the management of public business yet have never be subject to or receive that special and comprehensive legislation which these circumstance peculiarly demand be well aware of the various subject of great magnitude and immediate interest that press on the consideration of congress but believe there be not that appeal more directly to justice than a liberal and even generous attention to the interest of the|district|of|columbia and a thorough and careful revision of local government transcript fellow citizens of the senate and house|of|representatif the act of the|23d|of|june,|1836 regulate the deposit of the public money and direct the employment of state district and territorial bank for that purpose make the duty of the secretary of the treasury to discontinue the use of such of as should at any time refuse to redeem note in specie and to substitute other bank provide a sufficient number could be obtain to receive the public deposit upon the term and condition therein prescribe the general and almost simultaneous suspension of specie payment by the bank in may last render the performance of this duty imperative in respect to those which have be select under the act and make at the same time impracticable to employ the requisite number of other upon the prescribed condition the specific regulation establish by congress for the deposit and safe keeping of the public money have thus unexpectedly become inoperative feel to be duty to afford an early opportunity for the exercise of supervisory power over the subject be also lead to apprehend that the suspension of specie payment increase the embarrassment before exist in the pecuniary affair of the country would so far diminish the public revenue that the accrue receipt into the treasury would not with the reserve five|million be sufficient to defray the unavoidable expense of the government until the usual period for the meeting of congress whilst the authority to call upon the states for a portion of the sum deposit with be too restrict to enable the department to realize a sufficient amount from that source these apprehension have be justify by subsequent result which render certain that this deficiency will occur if additional mean be not provide by congress the difficulty experience by the mercantile interest in meet engagement induce to apply to previously to the actual suspension of specie payment for indulgence upon bond for duty and all the relief authorize by law be promptly and cheerfully grant the dependence of the treasury upon the avail of these bond to enable to make the deposit with the states require by law lead in the outset to limit this indulgence to the|1st|of|september but have since be extend to the|1st|of|october that the matter may be submit to further direction question be also expect to arise in the recess in respect to the october installment of those deposit require the interposition of congress a provision of another act pass about the same time and intend to secure a faithful compliance with the obligation of the|united|state to satisfy all demand upon in specie or equivalent prohibit the offer of any bank note not convertible on the spot into gold or silver at the will of the holder and the ability of the government with million on deposit to meet engagement in the manner thus require by law be render very doubtful by the event to which have refer sensible that adequate provision for these unexpected exigency could only be make by congress convince that some of would be indispensably necessary to the public service before the regular period of meeting and desirous also to enable to exercise at the early moment full constitutional power for the relief of the country could not with propriety avoid subject to the inconvenience of assemble at as|early|a|day as the state of the popular representation would permit be sure that have do but justice to feeling in believe that this inconvenience will be cheerfully encounter in the hope of render meeting conducive to the good of the country during the early stage of the revulsion through which have just pass much acrimonious discussion arise and great diversity of opinion exist as to real cause this be not surprising the operation of credit be so diversified and the influence which affect so numerous and often so subtle that even impartial and well inform person be seldom find to agree in respect to to inherent difficulty be also add other tendency which be by no mean favorable to the discovery of truth be hardly to be expect that those who disapprove the policy of the government in relation to the currency would in the excited state of public feeling produce by the occasion fail to attribute to that policy any extensive embarrassment in the monetary affair of the country the matter thus become connected with the passion and conflict of party opinion be more or less affect by political consideration and difference be prolong which may otherwise have be determine by an appeal to fact by the exercise of reason or by mutual concession be however a cheer reflection that circumstance of this nature can not prevent a community so intelligent as ours from ultimately arrive at correct conclusion encourage by the firm belief of this truth proceed to state view so far as may be necessary to a clear understanding of the remedy feel duty to propose and of the reason by which have be lead to recommend the history of trade in the|united|state for the|last|three|or|four|years afford the most convincing evidence that present condition be chiefly to be attribute to overaction in all the department of business an over action deriving perhaps first impulse from antecedent cause but stimulate to destructive consequence by excessive issue of bank paper and by other facility for the acquisition and enlargement of credit at the commencement of the|year|1834 the banking capital of the|united|state include that of the national bank then exist amount to about|$200,000,000 the bank note then in circulation to about million and the loan and discount of the bank to four|millions between that time and the|1st|of|january,|1836 be the late period to which accurate account have be receive banking capital be increase to more|than|two|hundred|and|fifty one|million paper circulation to more|than|one|hundred|and|forty|million and the loan and discount to more|than|four|hundred|and|fifty seven|millions to this vast increase be to be add the|many|million of credit acquire by mean of foreign loan contract by the states and state institution and above all by the lavish accommodation extend by foreign dealer to merchant the consequence of this redundancy of credit and of the spirit of reckless speculation engender by be a foreign debt contract by citizen estimate in march last at more|than|$30,000,000 the extension to trader in the interior of country of credit for supply greatly beyond the want of the people the investment of in unproductive public land in the|years|1835|and whilst in the|preceding|year the sale amount to only|four|and|a|half|millions the creation of debt to an almost countless amount for real estate in exist or anticipate city and village equally unproductive and at price now see to have be greatly disproportionate to real value the expenditure of immense sum in improvement which in many case have be find to be ruinously improvident the diversion to other pursuit of much of the labor that should have be apply to agriculture thereby contribute to the expenditure of large sum in the importation of grain from europe an expenditure which amount in to about|$250,000 be in the|first|two|quarters|of|the|present|year increase to more|than|$2,000,000 and finally without enumerate other injurious result the rapid growth among all class and especially in great commercial town of luxurious habit found too often on merely fancied wealth and detrimental alike to the industry the resource and the moral of people be so impossible that such a state of thing could long continue that the prospect of revulsion be present to the mind of considerate man before actually come none however have correctly anticipate severity a concurrence of circumstance inadequate of to produce such widespread and calamitous embarrassment tend so greatly to aggravate that can not be overlook in consider history among these may be mention as most prominent the great loss of capital sustain by commercial emporium in the fire of december loss the effect of which be underrated at the time because postpone for a season by the great facility of credit then exist the disturbing effect in commercial city of the transfer of the public money require by the deposit law of june,|1836 and the measure adopt by the foreign creditor of merchant to reduce debt and to withdraw from the|united|state a large portion of specie however unwilling any of citizen may heretofore have be to assign to these cause the chief instrumentality in produce the present state of thing the development subsequently make and the actual condition of other commercial country must as seem to dispel all remain doubt upon the subject have since appear that evil similar to those suffer by have be experience in great|britain on the continent and indeed throughout the commercial world and that in other country as well as in own have be uniformly precede by an undue enlargement of the boundary of trade prompt as with by unprecedented expansion of the system of credit a reference to the amount of banking capital and the issue of paper credit put in circulation in great|britain by bank and in other way during the|years|1834,|1835 and will show an augmentation of the paper currency there as much disproportione to the real want of trade as in the|united|state with this redundancy of the paper currency there arise in that country also a spirit of adventurous speculation embrace the whole range of human enterprise aid be profusely give to project improvement large investment be make in foreign stock and loan credit for good be grant with unbounded liberality to merchant in foreign country and all the mean of acquire and employ credit be put in active operation and extend in effect to every department of business and to every|quarter of the globe the reaction be proportion in violence to the extraordinary character of the event which precede the commercial community of great|britain be subject to the great difficulty and debtor in this country be not only suddenly deprive of accustomed and expect credit but call upon for payment which in the actual posture of thing here could only be make through a general pressure and at the most ruinous sacrifice in view of these fact would seem impossible for sincere inquirer after truth to resist the conviction that the cause of the revulsion in both country have be substantially the same nation the most commercial in the world enjoy but recently the high degree of apparent prosperity and maintain with each other the close relation be suddenly in a time of profound peace and without any great national disaster arrest in career and plunge into a state of embarrassment and distress in both country have witness the same redundancy of paper money and other facility of credit the same spirit of speculation the same partial success the same difficulty and revers and at length nearly the same overwhelming catastrophe the most material difference between the result in the country have only be that with there have also occur an extensive derangement in the fiscal affair of the|federal|and|state|government occasion by the suspension of specie payment by the bank the history of these cause and effect in great|britain and the|united|state be substantially the history of the revulsion in all other commercial country the present and visible effect of these circumstance on the operation of the government and on the industry of the people point out the object which call for immediate attention be to regulate by law the safe keeping transfer and disbursement of the public money to designate the fund to be receive and pay by the government to enable the treasury to meet promptly every demand upon to prescribe the term of indulgence and the mode of settlement to be adopt as well in collect from individual the revenue that have accrue as in withdraw from former depository and to devise and adopt such further measure within the constitutional competency of congress as will be best calculate to revive the enterprise and to promote the prosperity of the country for the deposit transfer and disbursement of the revenue national and state bank have always with temporary and limited exception be heretofore employ but although advocate of each system be still to be find be apparent that the event of the|last|few|month have greatly augment the desire long exist among the people of the|united|state to separate the fiscal operation of the government from those of individual or corporation again to create a national bank as a fiscal agent would be to disregard the popular will twice solemnly and unequivocally express on no question of domestic policy be there strong evidence that the sentiment of a large majority be deliberately fix and can not concur with those who think see in recent event a proof that these sentiment be or a reason that should be change event similar in origin and character have heretofore frequently occur without produce any such change and the lesson of experience must be forget if suppose that the present overthrow of credit would have be prevent by the existence of a national bank proneness to excessive issue have ever be the vice of the banking system a vice as prominent in national as in state institution this propensity be as subservient to the advancement of private interest in the one as in the other and those who direct both be principally guide by the same view and influence by the same motif will be equally ready to stimulate extravagance of enterprise by improvidence of credit how strikingly be this conclusion sustain by experience the|bank|of|the|united|state with the vast power confer on by congress do not or could not prevent former and similar embarrassment nor have the still great strength have be say to possess under present charter enable in the exist emergency to check other institution or even to save in great|britain where have be see the same cause have be attend with the same effect a national bank possess power far great than be ask for by the warm advocate of such an institution here have also prove unable to prevent an undue expansion of credit and the evil that flow from nor can find any tenable ground for the reestablishment of a national bank in the derangement allege at present to exist in the domestic exchange of the country or in the facility may be capable of afford although advantage of this sort be anticipate when the|first|bank|of|the|united|state be create be regard as an incidental accommodation not which the|federal|government be bind or could be call upon to furnish this accommodation be now indeed after the lapse of not many|year demand from as among first duty and an omission to aid and regulate commercial exchange be treat as a ground of loud and serious complaint such result only serve to exemplify the constant desire among some of citizen to enlarge the power of the government and extend control to subject with which should not interfere can never justify the creation of an institution to promote such object on the contrary justly excite among the community a more diligent inquiry into the character of those operation of trade toward which be desire to extend such peculiar favor the various transaction which bear the name of domestic exchange differ essentially in nature operation and utility class of consist of bill of exchange draw for the purpose of transfer actual capital from part of the country to another or to anticipate the proceed of property actually transmit bill of this description be highly useful in the movement of trade and well deserve all the encouragement which can rightfully be give to another class be make up of bill of exchange not draw to transfer actual capital nor on the credit of property transmit but to create fictitious capital partake at once of the character of note discount in bank and of bank note in circulation and swell the mass of paper credit to a vast extent in the most objectionable manner these bill have form for the|last|few|year a large proportion of what be term the domestic exchange of the country serve as the mean of usurious profit and constitute the most unsafe and precarious paper in circulation this species of traffic instead of be uphold ought to be discountenance by the government and the people in transfer fund from place to place the government be on the same footing with the private citizen and may resort to the same legal mean may do so through the medium of bill draw by or purchase from other and in these operation may in a manner undoubtedly constitutional and legitimate facilitate and assist exchange of individual found on real transaction of trade the extent to which this may be do and the good mean of effect be entitle to the full consideration this have be bestow by the secretary of the treasury and view will be submit to in report but be not design by the constitution that the government should assume the management of domestic or foreign exchange be indeed authorize to regulate by law the commerce between the states and to provide a general standard of value or medium of exchange in gold and silver but be not province to aid individual in the transfer of fund otherwise than through the facility afford by the|post office|department as justly may be call on to provide for the transportation of merchandise these be operation of trade ought to be conduct by those who be interested in in the same manner that the incidental difficulty of other pursuit be encounter by other class of citizen such aid have not be deem necessary in other country throughout europe the domestic as well as the foreign exchange be carry on by private house often if not generally without the assistance of bank yet extend throughout distinct sovereignty and far exceed in amount the real exchange of the|united|state there be no reason why own may not be conduct in the same manner with equal cheapness and safety certainly this may be accomplish if be favor by those most deeply interested and few can doubt that own interest as well as the general welfare of the country would be promote by leave such a subject in the hand of those to whom properly belong a system found on private interest enterprise and competition without the aid of legislative grant or regulation by law would rapidly prosper would be free from the influence of political agitation and extend the same exemption to trade and would put an end to those complaint of neglect partiality injustice and oppression which be the unavoidable result of interference by the government in the proper concern of individual all former attempt on the part of the government to carry legislation in this respect further than be design by the constitution have in the end prove injurious and have serve only to convince the great body of the people more and more of the certain danger of blend private interest with the operation of public business and there be no reason to suppose that a repetition of now would be more successful can not be conceal that there exist in community opinion and feeling on this subject in direct opposition to each other a large portion of combine great intelligence activity and influence be no doubt sincere in belief that the operation of trade ought to be assist by such a connection regard a national bank as necessary for this purpose and be disinclined to every measure that do not tend sooner or later to the establishment of such an institution on the other hand a majority of the people be believe to be irreconcilably oppose to that measure consider such a concentration of power dangerous to liberty and many of regard as a violation of the constitution this collision of opinion have doubtless cause much of the embarrassment to which the commercial transaction of the country have lately be expose banking have become a political topic of the high interest and trade have suffer in the conflict of party a speedy termination of this state of thing however desirable be scarcely to be expect have see for nearly|half|a|century that those who advocate a national bank by whatever motive may be influence constitute a portion of community too numerous to allow to hope for an early abandonment of favorite plan on the other hand must indeed form an erroneous estimate of the intelligence and temper of the american people who suppose that have continue on slight or insufficient ground persevere opposition to such an institution or that can be induce by pecuniary pressure or by any other combination of circumstance to surrender principle have so long and so inflexibly maintain own view of the subject be unchanged have be repeatedly and unreservedly announce to fellow citizen who with full knowledge of confer upon the high office of the government on the last of these occasion feel due to the people to apprise distinctly that in the event of election would not be able to cooperate in the reestablishment of a national bank to these sentiment have now only to add the expression of an increase conviction that the reestablishment of such a bank in any form whilst would not accomplish the beneficial purpose promise by advocate would impair the rightful supremacy of the popular will injure the character and diminish the influence of political system and bring once more into existence a concentrated moneyed power hostile to the spirit and threaten the permanency of republican institution local bank have be employ for the deposit and distribution of the revenue at all time partially and on different occasion exclusively first anterior to the establishment of the|first|bank|of|the|united|state secondly in the interval between the termination of that institution and the charter of successor and thirdly during the limited period which have now so abruptly close the connection thus repeatedly attempt prove unsatisfactory on each successive occasion notwithstanding the various measure which be adopt to facilitate or insure success on the last occasion in the|year|1833 the employment of the state bank be guard especially in every way which experience and caution could suggest personal security be require for the safe keep and prompt payment of the money to be receive and full return of condition be from time to time to be make by the depository in the first stage the measure be eminently successful notwithstanding the violent opposition of the|bank|of|the|united|state and the unceasing effort make to overthrow the select bank perform with fidelity and without any embarrassment to or to the community engagement to the government and the system promise to be permanently useful but when become necessary under the act of june,|1836 to withdraw from the public money for the purpose of place in additional institution or of transfer to the states find in many case inconvenient to comply with the demand of the treasury and numerous and press application be make for indulgence or relief as the installment under the deposit law become payable own embarrassment and the necessity under which lie of curtail discount and call in debt increase the general distress and contribute with other cause to hasten the revulsion in which at length in common with the other bank be fatally involve under these circumstance become solemn duty to inquire whether there be not in any connection between the government and bank of issue evil of great magnitude inherent in very nature and against which no precaution can effectually guard unforeseen in the organization of the government and force on the treasury by early necessity the practice of employ bank be in truth from the beginning more a measure of emergency than of sound policy when start into existence as a nation in addition to the burden of the new government assume all the large but honorable load of debt which be the price of liberty but hesitate to weigh down the infant industry of the country by resort to adequate taxation for the necessary revenue the facility of bank in return for the privilege acquire be promptly offer and perhaps too readily receive by an embarrassed treasury during the long continuance of a national debt and the intervene difficulty of a foreign war the connection be continue from motif of convenience but these cause have long since pass away have no emergency that make bank necessary to aid the want of the treasury have no load of national debt to provide for and have on actual deposit a large surplus no public interest therefore now require the renewal of a connection that circumstance have dissolve the complete organization of government the abundance of resource the general harmony which prevail between the different states and with foreign power all enable now to select the system most consistent with the constitution and most conducive to the public welfare should then connect the treasury for a fourth time with the local bank can only be under a conviction that past failure have arise from accidental not inherent defect a danger difficult if not impossible to be avoid in such an arrangement be make strikingly evident in the very event by which have now be defeat a sudden act of the bank intrust with the fund of the people deprive the treasury without fault or agency of the government of the ability to pay creditor in the currency have by law a right to demand this circumstance no fluctuation of commerce could have produce if the public revenue have be collect in the legal currency and keep in that form by the officer of the treasury the citizen whose money be in bank receive back since the suspension at a sacrifice in amount whilst who keep in the legal currency of the country and in own possession pursue without loss the current of business the government place in the situation of the former be involve in embarrassment could not have suffer have pursue the course of the latter these embarrassment be moreover augment by those salutary and just law which forbid to use a depreciated currency and by so do take from the government the ability which individual have of accommodate transaction to such a catastrophe a system which can in a time of profound peace when there be a large revenue lay by thus suddenly prevent the application and the use of the money of the people in the manner and for the object have direct can not be wise but who can think without painful reflection that under the same unforeseen event may have befall in the midst of a war and take from at the moment when most want the use of those very mean which be treasure up to promote the national welfare and guard national right to such embarrassment and to such danger will this government be always expose whilst take the money raise for and necessary to the public service out of the hand of own officer and convert into a mere right of action against corporation intrust with the possession of nor can such result be effectually guard against in such a system without invest the executive with a control over the bank whether state or national that may with reason be object to be probably the only government in the world that be liable in the management of fiscal concern to occurrence like these but this imminent risk be not the only danger attendant on the surrender of the public money to the custody and control of local corporation though the object be aid to the treasury effect may be to introduce into the operation of the government influence the most subtle found on interest the most selfish the use by the bank for own benefit of the money deposit with have receive the sanction of the government from the commencement of this connection the money receive from the people instead of be keep till be need for use be in consequence of this authority a fund on which discount be make for the profit of those who happen to be owner of stock in the bank select as depository the supposed and often exaggerated advantage of such a boon will always cause to be seek for with avidity will not stop to consider on whom the patronage incident to be to be confer whether the selection and control be trust to congress or to the executive either will be subject to appeal make in every form which the sagacity of interest can suggest the bank under such a system be stimulate to make the most of fortunate acquisition the deposit be treat as an increase of capital loan and circulation be rashly augment and when the public exigency require a return be attend with embarrassment not provide for nor foreseen thus bank that think most fortunate when the public fund be receive find most embarrassed when the season of payment suddenly arrive unfortunately too the evil of the system be not limit to the bank stimulate a general rashness of enterprise and aggravate the fluctuation of commerce and the currency this result be strikingly exhibit during the operation of the late deposit system and especially in the purchase of public land the order which ultimately direct the payment of gold and silver in such purchase greatly check but could not altogether prevent the evil specie be indeed more difficult to be procure than the note which the bank could create at pleasure but still be obtain from as a loan and return as a deposit which be again at liberty to use only pass round the circle with diminished speed this operation could not have be perform have the fund of the government go into the treasury to be regularly disburse and not into bank to be loan out for own profit while be permit to substitute for a credit in account in express these sentiment desire not to undervalue the benefit of a salutary credit to any branch of enterprise the credit bestow on probity and industry be the just reward of merit and an honorable incentive to further acquisition none oppose who love country and understand welfare but when be unduly encouraged when be make to inflame the public mind with the temptation of sudden and unsubstantial wealth when turn industry into path that lead sooner or later to disappointment and distress become liable to censure and need correction far from help probity and industry the ruin to which lead fall most severely on the great laboring class who be throw suddenly out of employment and by the failure of magnificent scheme never intend to enrich be deprive in a moment of only resource abuse of credit and excess in speculation will happen in despite of the most salutary law no government perhaps can altogether prevent but surely every government can refrain from contribute the stimulus that call into life since therefore experience have show that to lend the public money to the local bank be hazardous to the operation of the government at least of doubtful benefit to the institution and productive of disastrous derangement in the business and currency of the country be the part of wisdom again to renew the connection be true that such an agency be in many respect convenient to the treasury but be not indispensable a limitation of the expense of the government to actual want and of the revenue to those expense with convenient mean for prompt application to the purpose for which be raise be the object which should seek to accomplish the collection safe keeping transfer and disbursement of the public money can be believe be well manage by officer of the government collection and to a great extent disbursement also have indeed be hitherto conduct solely by neither national nor state bank when employ be require to do more than keep safely while in custody and transfer and pay in such portion and at such time as the treasury shall direct surely bank be not more able than the government to secure the money in possession against accident violence or fraud the assertion that be so must assume that a vault in a bank be strong than a vault in the treasury and that director cashier and clerk not select by the government nor under control be more worthy of confidence than officer select from the people and responsible to the government officer bind by official oath and bond for a faithful performance of duty and constantly subject to the supervision of congress the difficulty of transfer and the aid heretofore render by bank have be less than be usually suppose the actual account show that by far the large portion of payment be make within short or convenient distance from the place of collection and the whole number of warrant issue at the treasury in the yea the result of which will be believe afford a safe test for the future fall short of or an average of less|than|1 daily for each state in the city of new|york do not average more|than a day and at the city of washington the difficulty heretofore exist be moreover daily lessen by an increase in the cheapness and facility of communication and may be assert with confidence that the necessary transfer as well as the safe keeping and disbursement of the public money can be with safety and convenience accomplish through the agency of treasury officer this opinion have be in some degree confirm by actual experience since the discontinuance of the bank as fiscal agent in may last a period which from the embarrassment in commercial intercourse present obstacle as great as any that may be hereafter apprehend the manner of keep the public money since that period be fully state in the report of the secretary of the treasury that officer also suggest the propriety of assign by law certain additional duty to exist establishment and officer which with the modification and safeguard refer to by will think enable the department to continue to perform this branch of the public service without any material addition either to number or to the present expense the extent of the business to be transact have already be state and in respect to the amount of money with which the officer employ would be intrust at any time appear that assume a balance of five|million to be at all time keep in the treasury and the whole of leave in the hand of the collector and receiver the proportion of each would not exceed an average of but that deduct one|million for the use of the mint and assume the remain four|million to be in the hand of half of the present number of officer a supposition deem more likely to correspond with the fact the sum in the hand of each would still be less than the amount of most of the bond now take from the receiver of public money every apprehension however on the subject either in respect to the safety of the money or the faithful discharge of these fiscal transaction may appear to be effectually remove by add to the present mean of the treasury the establishment by law at a few important point of office for the deposit and disbursement of such portion of the public revenue as can not with obvious safety and convenience be leave in the possession of the collect officer until pay over by to the public creditor neither the amount retain in hand nor those deposit in the office would in an ordinary condition of the revenue be large in most case than those often under the control of disburse officer of the army and navy and may be make entirely safe by require such security and exercise such control supervision as congress may by law prescribe the principal officer whose appointment would become necessary under this plan take the large number suggest by the secretary of the treasury would not exceed nor the additional expense at the same estimate a year there can be no doubt of the obligation of those who be intrust with the affair of government to conduct with as little cost to the nation as be consistent with the public interest and be for congress and ultimately for the people to decide whether the benefit to be derive from keep fiscal concern apart and sever the connection which have hitherto exist between the government and bank offer sufficient advantage to justify the necessary expense if the object to be accomplish be deem important to the future welfare of the country can not allow to believe that the addition to the public expenditure of comparatively so small an amount as will be necessary to effect will be object to by the people will be see by the report of the postmaster general herewith communicate that the fiscal affair of that department have be successfully conduct since may last upon the principle of deal only in the legal currency of the|united|state and that need no legislation to maintain credit and facilitate the management of concern the exist law be in the opinion of that officer ample for those object difficulty will doubtless be encounter for a|season and increase service require from the public functionary such be usually incident to the commencement of every system but will be greatly lessen in the progress of operation the power and influence suppose to be connect with the custody and disbursement of the public money be topic on which the public mind be naturally and with great propriety peculiarly sensitive much have be say on in reference to the propose separation of the government from the banking institution and surely no one can object to any appeal or animadversion on the subject which be consistent with fact and evince a proper respect for the intelligence of the people if a chief magistrate may be allow to speak for on such a point can truly say that to nothing would be more acceptable than the withdrawal from the executive to the great practicable extent of all concern in the custody and disbursement of the public revenue not that would shrink from any responsibility cast upon by the duty of office but because be firm belief that capacity for usefulness be in no degree promote by the possession of any patronage not actually necessary to the performance of those duty but under present form of government the intervention of the executive officer in the custody and disbursement of the public money seem to be unavoidable and before can be admit that the influence and power of the executive would be increase by dispense with the agency of bank the nature of that intervention in such an agency must be carefully regard and a comparison must be institute between extent in the case the revenue can only be collect by officer appoint by the president with the advice and consent of the senate the public money in the first instance must therefore in all case pass through hand select by the executive other officer appoint in the same way or as in some case by the president alone must also be intrust with when draw for the purpose of disbursement be thus see that even when bank be employ the public fund must twice pass through the hand of executive officer besides this the head of the|treasury|department who also hold office at the pleasure of the president and some other officer of the same department must necessarily be invest with more or less power in the selection continuance and supervision of the bank that may be employ the question be then narrow to the single point whether in the intermediate stage between the collection and disbursement of the public money the agency of bank be necessary to avoid a dangerous extension of the patronage and influence of the executive but be clear that the connection of the executive with powerful moneyed institution capable of minister to the interest of man in point where be most accessible to corruption be less liable to abuse than constitutional agency in the appointment and control of the few public officer require by the propose plan will the public money when in hand be necessarily expose to any improper interference on the part of the executive may not be hope that a prudent fear of public jealousy and disapprobation in a matter so peculiarly expose to will deter from any such interference even if high motif be find inoperative may not congress so regulate by law the duty of those officer and subject to such supervision and publicity as to prevent the possibility of any serious abuse on the part of the executive and be there equal room for such supervision and publicity in a connection with bank act under the shield of corporate immunity and conduct by person irresponsible to the government and the people be believe that a considerate and candid investigation of these question will result in the conviction that the propose plan be far less liable to objection on the score of executive patronage and control than any bank agency that have be or can be devise with these view leave to congress the measure necessary to regulate in the present emergency the safe keeping and transfer of the public money in the performance of constitutional duty have state to without reserve the result of own reflection the subject be of great importance and on which can scarcely expect to be as united in sentiment as be in interest deserve a full and free discussion and can not fail to be benefit by a dispassionate comparison of opinion well aware of the duty of reciprocal concession among the coordinate branch of the government can promise a reasonable spirit of cooperation so far as can be indulge in without the surrender of constitutional objection which believe to be well found any system that may be adopt should be subject to the full legal provision so as to leave nothing to the executive but what be necessary to the discharge of the duty impose on and whatever plan may be ultimately establish own part shall be so discharge as to give to a fair trial and the good prospect of success the character of the fund to be receive and disburse in the transaction of the government likewise demand most careful consideration there can be no doubt that those who frame and adopt the constitution have in immediate view the depreciated paper of the confederacy of which in paper be at time only equal to in coin intend to prevent the recurrence of similar evil so far at least as relate to the transaction of the new government give to congress express power to coin money and to regulate the value thereof and of foreign coin refuse to give power to establish corporation the agent then as now chiefly employ to create a paper currency prohibit the states from make anything but gold and silver a legal tender in payment of debt and the|first|congress direct by positive law that the revenue should be receive in nothing but gold and silver public exigency at the outset of the government without direct legislative authority lead to the use of bank as fiscal aid to the treasury in admit deviation from the law at the same period and under the same exigency the secretary of the treasury receive note in payment of duty the sole ground on which the practice thus commence be then or have since be justify be the certain immediate and convenient exchange of such note for specie the government do indeed receive the inconvertible note of state bank during the difficulty of war and the community submit without a murmur to the unequal taxation and multiply evil of which such a course be productive with the war this indulgence cease and the bank be oblige again to redeem note in gold and silver the treasury in accordance with previous practice continue to dispense with the currency require by the act of and take the note of bank in full confidence of being pay in specie on demand and congress to guard against the slight violation of this principle have declare by law that if note be pay in the transaction of the government must be under such circumstance as to enable the holder to convert into specie without depreciation or delay of own duty under the exist law when the bank suspend specie payment could not doubt direction be immediately give to prevent the reception into the treasury of anything but gold and silver or equivalent and every practicable arrangement be make to preserve the public faith by similar or equivalent payment to the public creditor the revenue from land have be for some time substantially so collected under the order issue by direction of predecessor the effect of that order have be so salutary and forecast in regard to the increase insecurity of bank paper have become so apparent that even before the catastrophe have resolve not to interfere with operation congress be now to decide whether the revenue shall continue to be so collected or not the receipt into the treasury of bank note not redeem in specie on demand will not presume be sanction would destroy without the excuse of war or public distress that equality of impost and identity of commercial regulation which lie at the foundation of confederacy and would offer to each state a direct temptation to increase foreign trade by depreciate the currency receive for duty in port such a proceeding would also in a great degree frustrate the policy so highly cherished of infuse into circulation a large proportion of the precious metal a policy the wisdom of which none can doubt though there may be different opinion as to the extent to which should be carry result have be already too auspicious and success be too closely interwoven with the future prosperity of the country to permit for a moment to contemplate abandonment have see under influence specie augment beyond eighty|millions coinage increase so as to make that of gold amount and december,|1836 to exceed the whole coinage at the mint during the|thirty one|previous|year the prospect of further improvement continue without abatement until the moment of the suspension of specie payment this policy have now indeed be suddenly check but be still far from be overthrow amidst all conflicting theory position be undeniable the precious metal will invariably disappear when there cease to be a necessity for use as a circulate medium be in strict accordance with this truth that whilst in the|month|of|may last be everywhere see and be current for all ordinary purpose disappear from circulation the moment the payment of specie be refuse by the bank and the community tacitly agree to dispense with employment place be supply by a currency exclusively of paper and in many case of the bad description already be the bank note now in circulation greatly depreciate and fluctuate in value between place and another thus diminish and make uncertain the worth of property and the price of labor and fail to subserve except at a heavy loss the purpose of business with each succeed day the metallic currency decrease by some be hoard in the natural fear that once part with can not be replace while by other be divert from more legitimate us for the sake of gain should congress sanction this condition of thing by make irredeemable paper money receivable in payment of public due a temporary check to a wise and salutary policy will in all probability be convert into absolute destruction be true that bank note actually convertible into specie may be receive in payment of the revenue without be liable to all these objection and that such a course may to some extent promote individual convenience an object always to be consider where do not conflict with the principle of government or the general welfare of the country if such note only be receive and always under circumstance allow early presentation for payment and if at short and fix period be convert into specie to be keep by the officer of the treasury some of the most serious obstacle to reception would perhaps be remove to retain the note in the treasury would be to renew under another form the loan of public money to the bank and the evil consequent thereon be however a mistaken impression that any large amount of specie be require for public payment of the or eighty|million now estimate to be in the country ten|million would be abundantly sufficient for that purpose provide an accumulation of a large amount of revenue beyond the necessary want of the government be hereafter prevent if to these consideration be add the facility which will arise from enable the treasury to satisfy the public creditor by draft or note receivable in payment of the public due may be safely assume that no motive of convenience to the citizen require the reception of bank paper to say that the refusal of paper money by the government introduce an unjust discrimination between the currency receive by and that use by individual in ordinary affair be in judgment to view in a very erroneous light the constitution prohibit the states from make anything but gold and silver a tender in the payment of debt and thus secure to every citizen a right to demand payment in the legal currency to provide by law that the government will only receive due in gold and silver be not to confer on any peculiar privilege but merely to place on an equality with the citizen by reserve to a right secure to by the constitution be doubtless for this reason that the principle have be sanction by successive law from the time of the first congress under the constitution down to the last such precedent never object to and proceed from such source afford a decisive answer to the imputation of inequality or injustice but in fact the measure be of restriction not of favor to forbid the public agent to receive in payment any other than a certain kind of money be to refuse a discretion possess by every citizen may be leave to those who have the management of own transaction to make own term but no such discretion should be give to who act merely as an agent of the people who be to collect what the law require and to pay the appropriation make when bank note be redeem on demand there be then no discrimination in reality for the individual who receive may at option substitute the specie for take from convenience or choice when be not so redeem will scarcely be contend that receipt and payment by a public officer should be permit though none deny that right to an individual if be the effect would be most injurious to the public since officer could make none of those arrangement to meet or guard against the depreciation which an individual be at liberty to do nor can inconvenience to the community be allege as an objection to such a regulation object and motive be convenience and welfare if at a moment of simultaneous and unexpected suspension by the bank add something to the many embarrassment of that proceeding yet these be far overbalance by direct tendency to produce a wide circulation of gold and silver to increase the safety of bank paper to improve the general currency and thus to prevent altogether such occurrence and the other and far great evil that attend may indeed be question whether be not for the interest of the bank that the government should not receive paper would be conduct with more caution and on sounder principle by use specie only in transaction the government would create a demand for which would to a great extent prevent exportation and by keep in circulation maintain a broad and safe basis for the paper currency that the bank would thus be render more sound and the community more safe can not admit of a doubt the forego view seem to do but fairly carry out the provision of the|federal|constitution in relation to the currency as far as relate to the public revenue at the time that instrument be frame there be but bank in the|united|state and have the extension of the banking system and the evil grow out of be foresee would probably have be specially guard against the same policy which lead to the prohibition of bill of credit by the states would doubtless in that event have also interdict issue as a currency in any other form the constitution however contain no such prohibition and since the states have exercise for nearly|half|a|century the power to regulate the business of banking be not to be expect that will be abandon the whole matter be now under discussion before the proper tribunal the people of the states never before have the public mind be so thoroughly awaken to a proper sense of importance never have the subject in all bearing be submit to so search an inquiry would be distrust the intelligence and virtue of the people to doubt the speedy and efficient adoption of such measure of reform as the public good demand all that can rightfully be do by the|federal|government to promote the accomplishment of that important object will without doubt be perform in the meantime be duty to provide all the remedy against a depreciated paper currency which the constitution enable to afford the|treasury|department on several former occasion have suggest the propriety and importance of a uniform law concern bankruptcy of corporation and other banker through the instrumentality of such a law a salutary check may doubtless be impose on the issue of paper money and an effectual remedy give to the citizen in a way at once equal in all part of the union and fully authorize by the constitution the indulgence grant by executive authority in the payment of bond for duty have be already mention see that the immediate enforcement of these obligation would subject a large and highly respectable portion of citizen to great sacrifice and believe that a temporary postponement could be make without detriment to other interest and with increase certainty of ultimate payment do not hesitate to comply with the request that be make of the term allow be to the full extent as liberal as any that be to be find in the practice of the executive department remain for congress to decide whether a further postponement may not with propriety be allow and if so legislation upon the subject be respectfully invite the report of the secretary of the treasury will exhibit the condition of these debt the extent and effect of the present indulgence the probable result of further extension on the state of the treasury and every other fact necessary to a full consideration of the subject similar information be communicate in regard to such depository of the public money as be indebte to the government in order that congress may also adopt the proper measure in regard to the receipt and expenditure for the|first|half|of|the|year and an estimate of those for the residue will be lay before by the secretary of the treasury in report of december last be estimate that the current receipt would fall short of the expenditure by about|$3,000,000 will be see that the difference will be much great this be to be attribute not only to the occurrence of great pecuniary embarrassment in the business of the country than those which be then predict and consequently a great diminution in the revenue but also to the fact that the appropriation exceed by nearly|six|million the amount which be ask for in the estimate then submit the sum necessary for the service of the|year beyond the probable receipt and the amount which be intend should be reserve in the treasury at the commencement of the|year will be about|six|million if the whole of the reserve balance be not at once apply to the current expenditure but four|million be still keep in the treasury as seem most expedient for the us of the mint and to meet contingency the sum need will be ten|million in make this estimate the receipt be calculate on the supposition of some further extension of the indulgence grant in the payment of bond for duty which will affect the amount of the revenue for the|present|year to the extent of be not propose to procure the require amount by loan or increase taxation there be now in the treasury direct by the act of the|23d|of|june,|1836 to be deposit with the states in october next this sum if so deposited will be subject under the law to be recall if need to defray exist appropriation and as be now evident that the whole or the principal part of will be want for that purpose appear most proper that the deposit should be withhold until the amount can be collect from the bank treasury note may be temporarily issue to be gradually redeem as be receive be aware that this course may be productive of inconvenience to many of the states rely upon the act of congress which hold out to the strong probability if not the certainty of receive this installment have in some instance adopt measure with which retention may seriously interfere that such a condition of thing should have occur be much to be regret be not the least among the unfortunate result of the disaster of the time and be for congress to devise a fit remedy if there be the money be indispensable to the want of the treasury be difficult to conceive upon what principle of justice or expediency application to that object can be avoid to recall any portion of the sum already deposit with the states would be more inconvenient and less efficient to burden the country with increase taxation when there be in fact a large surplus revenue would be unjust and unwise to raise money by loan under such circumstance and thus to commence a new national debt would scarcely be sanction by the american people the plan propose will be adequate to all fiscal operation during the remainder of the|year should be adopt the treasury aid by the ample resource of the country will be able to discharge punctually every pecuniary obligation for the future all that be need will be that caution and forbearance in appropriation which the diminution of the revenue require and which the complete accomplishment or great forwardness of many expensive national undertakings render equally consistent with prudence and patriotic liberality the precede suggestion and recommendation be submit in the belief that adoption by congress will enable the executive department to conduct fiscal concern with success so far as management have be commit to whilst the object and the mean propose to attain be within constitutional power and appropriate duty will at the same time be hope by necessary operation afford essential aid in the transaction of individual concern and thus yield relief to the people at large in a form adapt to the nature of government those who look to the action of this government for specific aid to the citizen to relieve embarrassment arise from loss by revulsion in commerce and credit lose sight of the end for which be create and the power with which be clothe be establish to give security to all in lawful and honorable pursuit under the lasting safeguard of republican institution be not intend to confer special favor on individual or on any class of to create system of agriculture manufacture or trade or to engage in either separately or in connection with individual citizen or organize association if operation be to be direct for the benefit of any class equivalent favor must in justice be extend to the rest and the attempt to bestow such favor with an equal hand or even to select those who should most deserve would never be successful all community be apt to look to government for too much even in own country where power and duty be so strictly limited be prone to do so especially at period of sudden embarrassment and distress but this ought not to be the framer of excellent constitution and the people who approve with calm and sagacious deliberation act at the time on a sounder principle wisely judge that the less government interfere with private pursuit the well for the general prosperity be not legitimate object to make man rich or to repair by direct grant of money or legislation in favor of particular pursuit loss not incur in the public service this would be substantially to use the property of some for the benefit of other but real duty that duty the performance of which make a good government the most precious of human blessing be to enact and enforce a system of general law commensurate with but not exceed the object of establishment and to leave every citizen and every interest to reap under benign protection the reward of virtue industry and prudence can not doubt that on this as on all similar occasion will find agency most conducive to the security and happiness of the people when limit to the exercise of concede power in never assume even for a well mean object such power as be not design to be confer upon shall in reality do most for the general welfare to avoid every unnecessary intereference with the pursuit of the citizen will result in more benefit than to adopt measure which could only assist limited interest and be eagerly but perhaps naturally seek for under the pressure of temporary circumstance if therefore refrain from suggest to congress any specific plan for regulate the exchange of the country relieve mercantile embarrassment or interfere with the ordinary operation of foreign or domestic commerce be from a conviction that such measure be not within the constitutional province of the|general|government and that adoption would not promote the real and permanent welfare of those may be design to aid the difficulty and distress of the time though unquestionably great be limit in extent and can not be regard as affect the permanent prosperity of the nation arise in a great degree from the transaction of foreign and domestic commerce be upon that have chiefly fall the great agricultural interest have in many part of the country suffer comparatively little and as if providence intend to display the munifence of goodness at the moment of great need and in direct contrast to the evil occasion by the waywardness of man have be bless throughout extended territory with a season of general health and of uncommon fruitfulness the proceed of great staple will soon furnish the mean of liquidate debt at home and abroad and contribute equally to the revival of commercial activity and the restoration of commercial credit the bank establish avowedly for support derive profit from and rest under obligation to which can not be overlook will feel at once the necessity and justice of unite energy with those of the mercantile interest the suspension of specie payment at such a time and under such circumstance as have lately witness could not be other than a temporary measure and can scarcely err in believe that the period must soon arrive when all that be solvent will redeem issue in gold and silver dealing abroad naturally depend on resource and prosperity at home if the debt of merchant have accumulate or credit be impair these be fluctuation always incident to extensive or extravagant mercantile transaction but the ultimate security of such obligation do not admit of question be guarantee by the resource of a country the fruit of whose indutry afford abundant mean of ample liquidation and by the evident interest of every merchant to sustain a credit hitherto high by promptly apply these mean for preservation deeply regret that event have occur which require to ask consideration of such serious topic could have wish that in make first communication to the assemble representative of country have nothing to dwell upon but the history of unalloyed prosperity since be otherwise can only feel more deeply the responsibility of the respective trust that have be confide to and under the pressure of difficulty unite in invoke the guidance and aid of the|supreme|ruler|of|nation and in labor with zealous resolution to overcome the difficulty by which be environ be under such circumstance a high gratification to know by long experience that act for a people to whom the truth however unpromising can always be speak with safety for the trial of whose patriotism no emergency be too severe and who be sure never to desert a public functionary honestly labor for the public good seem just that should receive without delay any aid in embarrassment which deliberation can afford come directly from the midst of and know the course of event in every section of country from may best be learn as well the extent and nature of these embarrassment as the most desirable measure of relief be aware however that be not proper to detain at present longer than may be demand by the special object for which be convene to therefore have confine communication and believe will not be own wish now to extend deliberation beyond reserve till the usual period of annual meeting that general information on the state of the union which the constitution require to give m.|van|buren transcript fellow citizens be about to retire finally from public

that have generally be meet in a corresponding temper difficulty of old standing have be surmount by friendly discussion and the mutual desire to be just and the claim of citizen which have be long withhold have at length be acknowledge and adjust and satisfactory arrangement make for final payment and with a limited and trust a temporary exception relation with every foreign power be now of the most friendly character commerce continually expand and flag respect in every quarter of the world these cheer and grateful prospect and these multiply favor owe under providence to the adoption of the|federal|constitution be no longer a question whether this great country can remain happily united and flourish under present form of government experience the unerring test of all human undertaking have show the wisdom and foresight of those who form and have prove that in the union of these states there be a sure foundation for the bright hope of freedom and for the happiness of the people at every hazard and by every sacrifice this union must be preserve the necessity of watch with jealous anxiety for the preservation of the union be earnestly press upon fellow citizen by the|father|of|his country in farewell|address have there tell that while experience shall not have demonstrate impracticability there will always be reason to distrust the patriotism of those who in any|quarter may endeavor to weaken band and have caution in the strong term against the formation of party on geographical discrimination as of the mean which may disturb union and to which design man would be likely to resort the lesson contain in this invaluable legacy of washington to countryman should be cherish in the heart of every citizen to the late generation and perhaps at no period of time could be more usefully remember than at the present moment for when look upon the scene that be pass around and dwell upon the page of parting address paternal counsel would seem to be not merely the offspring of wisdom and foresight but the voice of prophecy foretell event and warn of the evil to come forty|year have pass since this imperishable document be give to countryman the|federal|constitution be then regard by as an experiment and so speak of in address but an experiment upon the success of which the good hope of country depend and all know that be prepared to lay down life if necessary to secure to a full and a fair trial the trial have be make have succeed beyond the proud hope of those who frame every quarter of this widely extend nation have feel blessing and share in the general prosperity produce by adoption but amid this general prosperity and splendid success the danger of which warn be become every day more evident and the sign of evil be sufficiently apparent to awaken the deep anxiety in the bosom of the patriot behold systematic effort publicly make to sow the seed of discord between different part of the|united|state and to place party division directly upon geographical distinction to excite the south against the north and the north against the south and to force into the controversy the most delicate and exciting topic topic upon which be impossible that a large portion of the union can ever speak without strong emotion appeal too be constantly make to sectional interest in order to influence the election of the|chief|magistrate as if be desire that should favor a particular quarter of the country instead of fulfil the duty of station with impartial justice to all and the possible dissolution of the union have at length become an ordinary and familiar subject of discussion have the warning voice of washington be forget or have design already be form to sever the union let not be suppose that impute to all of those who have take an active part in these unwise and unprofitable discussion a want of patriotism or of public virtue the honorable feeling of state pride and local attachment find a place in the bosom of the most enlightened and pure but while such man be conscious of own integrity and honesty of purpose ought never to forget that the citizen of other states be political brother and that however mistake may be in view the great body of be equally honest and upright with mutual suspicion and reproach may in time create mutual hostility and artful and design man will always be find who be ready to foment these fatal division and to inflame the natural jealousy of different section of the country the history of the world be full of such example and especially the history of republic what have to gain by division and dissension delude not yourself with the belief that a breach once make may be afterwards repair if the union be once sever the line of separation will grow wide and wider and the controversy which be now debate and settle in the hall of legislation will then be try in field of battle and determine by the sword neither should deceive yourself with the hope that the first line of separation would be the permanent one and that nothing but harmony and concord would be find in the new association form upon the dissolution of this union local interest would still be find there and unchastened ambition and if the recollection of common danger in which the people of these|united|states stand side by side against the common foe the memory of victory win by united valor the prosperity and happiness have enjoy under the present constitution the proud name bear as citizen of this great republic if all these recollection and proof of common interest be not strong enough to bind together as people what tie will hold unite the new division of empire when these bond have be break and this union dissever the first line of separation would not last for a single generation new fragment would be tear off new leader would spring up and this great and glorious republic would soon be break into a multitude of petty states without commerce without credit jealous of one another armed for mutual aggression load with taxis to pay army and leader seek aid against each other from foreign power insult and trample upon by the nation of europe until harass with conflict and humble and debase in spirit would be ready to submit to the absolute dominion of any military adventurer and to surrender liberty for the sake of repose be impossible to look on the consequence that would inevitably follow the destruction of this government and not feel indignant when hear cold calculation about the value of the union and have so constantly before a line of conduct so well calculate to weaken tie there be too much at stake to allow pride or passion to influence decision never for a moment believe that the great body of the citizen of any state or states can deliberately intend to do wrong may under the influence of temporary excitement or misguided opinion commit mistake may be mislead for a time by the suggestion of self interest but in a community so enlightened and patriotic as the people of the|united|state argument will soon make sensible of error and when convinced will be ready to repair if have no high or well motif to govern will at least perceive that own interest require to be just to other as hope to receive justice at hand but in order to maintain the union unimpaire be absolutely necessary that the law pass by the constitute authority should be faithfully execute in every part of the country and that every good citizen should at all time stand ready to put down with the combine force of the nation every attempt at unlawful resistance under whatever pretext may be make or whatever shape may assume unconstitutional or oppressive law may no doubt be pass by congress either from erroneous view or the want of due consideration if be within the reach of judicial authority the remedy be easy and peaceful and if from the character of the law be an abuse of power not within the control of the judiciary then free discussion and calm appeal to reason and to the justice of the people will not fail to redress the wrong but until the law shall be declare void by the court or repeal by congress no individual or combination of individual can be justify in forcibly resist execution be impossible that any government can continue to exist upon any other principle would cease to be a government and be unworthy of the name if have not the power to enforce the execution of own law within own sphere of action be true that case may be imagine disclose such a settled purpose of usurpation and oppression on the part of the government as would justify an appeal to arm these however be extreme case which have no reason to apprehend in a government where the power be in the hand of a patriotic people and no citizen who love country would in any case whatever resort to forcible resistance unless clearly see that the time have come when a freeman should prefer death to submission for if such a struggle be once begin and the citizen of section of the country array in arm against those of another in doubtful conflict let the battle result as may there will be an end of the union and with an end to the hope of freedom the victory of the injure would not secure to the blessing of liberty would avenge wrong but would share in the common ruin but the constitution can not be maintain nor the union preserve in opposition to public feeling by the mere exertion of the coercive power confide to the|general|government the foundation must be lay in the affection of the people in the security give to life liberty character and property in every quarter of the country and in the fraternal attachment which the citizen of the several states bear to one another as member of political family mutually contribute to promote the happiness of each other hence the citizen of every state should studiously avoid everything calculate to wound the sensibility or offend the just pride of the people of other states and should frown upon any proceeding within own border likely to disturb the tranquillity of political brother in other portion of the union in a country so extensive as the|united|state and with pursuit so varied the internal regulation of the several states must frequently differ from another in important particular and this difference be unavoidably increase by the vary principle upon which the american colony be originally plant principle which have take deep root in social relation before the revolution and therefore of necessity influence policy since become free and independent states but each state have the unquestionable right to regulate own internal concern accord to own pleasure and while do not interfere with the right of the people of other states or the right of the union every state must be the sole judge of the measure proper to secure the safety of citizen and promote happiness and all effort on the part of people of other states to cast odium upon institution and all measure calculate to disturb right of property or to put in jeopardy peace and internal tranquillity be in direct opposition to the spirit in which the union be form and must endanger safety motif of philanthropy may be assign for this unwarrantable interference and weak man may persuade for a moment that be labor in the cause of humanity and assert the right of the human race but everyone upon sober reflection will see that nothing but mischief can come from these improper assault upon the feeling and right of other rest assure that the man find busy in this work of discord be not worthy of confidence and deserve strong reprobation in the legislation of congress also and in every measure of the|general|government justice to every portion of the|united|states should be faithfully observe no free government can stand without virtue in the people and a lofty spirit of patriotism and if the sordid feeling of mere selfishness shall usurp the place which ought to be fill by public spirit the legislation of congress will soon be convert into a scramble for personal and sectional advantage under free institution the citizen of every quarter of country be capable of attain a high degree of prosperity and happiness without seek to profit at the expense of other and every such attempt must in the end fail to succeed for the people in every part of the|united|state be too enlighten not to understand own right and interest and to detect and defeat every effort to gain undue advantage over and when such design be discover naturally provoke resentment which can not always be easily allay justice full and ample justice to every portion of the|united|states should be the rule principle of every freeman and should guide the deliberation of every public body whether be state or national be well know that there have always be those amongst who wish to enlarge the power of the general|government and experience would seem to indicate that there be a tendency on the part of this government to overstep the boundary mark out for by the constitution legitimate authority be abundantly sufficient for all the purpose for which be create and power be expressly enumerate there can be no justification for claim anything beyond every attempt to exercise power beyond these limit should be promptly and firmly oppose for evil example will lead to other measure still more mischievous and if the principle of constructive power or suppose advantage or temporary circumstance shall ever be permit to justify the assumption of a power not give by the constitution the|general|government will before long absorb all the power of legislation and will have in effect but consolidated government from the extent of country diversified interest different pursuit and different habit be too obvious for argument that a single consolidated government would be wholly inadequate to watch over and protect interest and every friend of free institution should be always prepared to maintain unimpaired and in full vigor the right and sovereignty of the states and to confine the action of the|general|government strictly to the sphere of appropriate duty there be perhaps no of the power confer on the|federal|government so liable to abuse as the tax power the most productive and convenient source of revenue be necessarily give to that may be able to perform the important duty impose upon and the taxis which lay upon commerce be conceal from the real payer in the price of the article do not so readily attract the attention of the people as small sum demand from directly by the taxgatherer but the tax impose on good enhance by so much the price of the commodity to the consumer and as many of these duty be impose on article of necessity which be daily use by the great body of the people the money raise by these impost be draw from pocket congress have no right under the constitution to take money from the people unless be require to execute some of the specific power intrust to the government and if raise more than be necessary for such purpose be an abuse of the power of taxation and unjust and oppressive may indeed happen that the revenue will sometimes exceed the amount anticipate when the taxis be lay when however this be ascertain be easy to reduce and in such a case be unquestionably the duty of the government to reduce for no circumstance can justify in assume a power not give to by the constitution nor in take away the money of the people when be not need for the legitimate want of the government plain as these principle appear to be will yet find there be a constant effort to induce the|general|government to go beyond the limit of tax power and to impose unnecessary burden upon the people many powerful interest be continually at work to procure heavy duty on commerce and to swell the revenue beyond the real necessity of the public service and the country have already feel the injurious effect of combine influence succeed in obtain a tariff of duty bear most oppressively on the agricultural and laboring class of society and produce a revenue that could not be usefully employ within the range of the power confer upon congress and in order to fasten upon the people this unjust and unequal system of taxation extravagant scheme of internal improvement be get up in various|quarter to squander the money and to purchase support thus unconstitutional measure be intend to be uphold by another and the abuse of the power of taxation be to be maintain by usurp the power of expend the money in internal improvement can not have forget the severe and doubtful struggle through which pass when the executive department of the government by veto endeavor to arrest this prodigal scheme of injustice and to bring back the legislation of congress to the boundary prescribe by the constitution the good sense and practical judgment of the people when the subject be bring before sustain the course of the executive and this plan of unconstitutional expenditure for the purpose of corrupt influence be trust finally overthrow the result of this decision have be feel in the rapid extinguishment of the public debt and the large accumulation of a surplus in the treasury notwithstanding the tariff be reduce and be now very far below the amount originally contemplate by advocate but rely upon the design to collect an extravagant revenue and to burden with taxis beyond the economical want of the government be not yet abandon the various interest which have combine together to impose a heavy tariff and to produce an overflowing treasury be too strong and have too much at stake to surrender the contest the corporation and wealthy individual who be engage in large manufacturing establishment desire a high tariff to increase gain designing politician will support to conciliate favor and to obtain the mean of profuse expenditure for the purpose of purchase influence in other|quarter and since the people have decide that the|federal|government can not be permit to employ income in internal improvement effort will be make to seduce and mislead the citizen of the several states by hold out to the deceitful prospect of benefit to be derive from a surplus revenue collect by the|general|government and annually divide among the states and if encourage by these fallacious hope the states should disregard the principle of economy which ought to characterize every republican government and should indulge in lavish expenditure exceed resource will before long find oppress with debt which be unable to pay and the temptation will become irresistible to support a high tariff in order to obtain a surplus for distribution do not allow yourself fellow citizen to be mislead on this subject the|federal|government can not collect a surplus for such purpose without violate the principle of the constitution and assume power which have not be grant be moreover a system of injustice and if persist in will inevitably lead to corruption and must end in ruin the surplus revenue will be draw from the pocket of the people from the farmer the mechanic and the laboring class of society but who will receive when distribute among the states where be to be dispose of by lead state politician who have friend to favor and political partisan to gratify will certainly not be return to those who pay and who have most need of and be honestly entitle to there be but safe rule and that be to confine the|general|government rigidly within the sphere of appropriate duty have no power to raise a revenue or impose taxis except for the purpose enumerate in the constitution and if income be find to exceed these want should be forthwith reduce and the burden of the people so far lighten in review the conflict which have take place between different interest in the|united|state and the policy pursue since the adoption of present form of government find nothing that have produce such deep seat evil as the course of legislation in relation to the currency the|constitution|of the|united|state unquestionably intend to secure to the people a circulate medium of gold and silver but the establishment of a national bank by congress with the privilege of issue paper money receivable in the payment of the public due and the unfortunate course of legislation in the several states upon the same subject drive from general circulation the constitutional currency and substitute of paper in place be not easy for man engage in the ordinary pursuit of business whose attention have not be particularly draw to the subject to foresee all the consequence of a currency exclusively of paper and ought not on that account to be surprised at the facility with which law be obtain to carry into effect the paper system honest and even enlighten man be sometimes mislead by the specious and plausible statement of the designing but experience have now prove the mischief and danger of a paper currency and rest with to determine whether the proper remedy shall be apply the paper system be found on public confidence and have of no intrinsic value be liable to great and sudden fluctuation thereby render property insecure and the wage of labor unsteady and uncertain the corporation which create the paper money can not be rely upon to keep the circulate medium uniform in amount in time of prosperity when confidence be high be tempt by the prospect of gain or by the influence of those who hope to profit by to extend issue of paper beyond the bound of discretion and the reasonable demand of business and when these issue have be push on until public confidence be at length shake then a reaction take place and immediately withdraw the credit have give suddenly curtail issue and produce an unexpected and ruinous contraction of the circulate medium which be feel by the whole community the bank by this mean save and the mischievous consequence of imprudence or cupidity be visit upon the public nor do the evil stop here these ebb and flow in the currency and these indiscreet extension of credit naturally engender a spirit of speculation injurious to the habit and character of the people have already see effect in the wild spirit of speculation in the public land and various kind of stock which within the|last|year or seize upon such a multitude of citizen and threaten to pervade all class of society and to withdraw attention from the sober pursuit of honest industry be not by encourage this spirit that shall best preserve public virtue and promote the true interest of country but if currency continue as exclusively paper as now be will foster this eager desire to amass wealth without labor will multiply the number of dependent on bank accommodation and bank favor the temptation to obtain money at any sacrifice will become strong and strong and inevitably lead to corruption which will find way into public council and destroy at no distant day the purity of government some of the evil which arise from this system of paper press with peculiar hardship upon the class of society least able to bear a portion of this currency frequently becamedepreciate or worthless and all of be easily counterfeit in such a manner as to require peculiar skill and much experience to distinguish the counterfeit from the genuine note these fraud be most generally perpetrate in the small note which be use in the daily transaction of ordinary business and the loss occasion by be commonly throw upon the laboring class of society whose situation and pursuit put out of power to guard from these imposition and whose daily wage be necessary for subsistence be the duty of every government so to regulate currency as to protect this numerous class as far as practicable from the imposition of avarice and fraud be more especially the duty of the|united|state where the government be emphatically the government of the people and where this respectable portion of citizen be so proudly distinguish from the laboring class of all other nation by independent spirit love of liberty intelligence and high tone of moral character industry in peace be the source of wealth and bravery in war have cover with glory and the|government|of|the|united|state will but ill discharge duty if leave a prey to such dishonest imposition yet be evident that interest can not be effectually protect unless silver and gold be restore to circulation these view alone of the paper currency be sufficient to call for immediate reform but there be another consideration which should still more strongly press upon attention recent event have prove that the paper money system of this country may be use as an engine to undermine free institution and that those who desire to engross all power in the hand of the few and to govern by corruption or force be aware of power and prepare to employ bank now furnish only circulate medium and money be plenty or scarce accord to the quantity of note issue by while have capital not greatly disproportione to each other be competitor in business and no one of can exercise dominion over the rest and although in the present state of the currency these bank may and do operate injuriously upon the habit of business the pecuniary concern and the moral tone of society yet from number and disperse situation can not combine for the purpose of political influence and whatever may be the disposition of some of power of mischief must necessarily be confine to a narrow space and feel only in immediate neighborhood but when the charter for the|bank|of|the|united|state be obtain from congress perfect the scheme of the paper system and give to advocate the position have struggle to obtain from the commencement of the|federal|government to the|present|hour the immense capital and peculiar privilege bestow upon enable to exercise despotic sway over the other bank in every part of the country from superior strength could seriously injure if not destroy the business of any of which may incur resentment and openly claim for the power of regulate the currency throughout the|united|state in other word assert and undoubtedly possess the power to make money plenty or scarce at pleasure at any time and in any quarter of the union by control the issue of other bank and permit an expansion or compel a general contraction of the circulate medium accord to own will the other banking institution be sensible of strength and soon generally become obedient instrument ready at all time to execute mandate and with the bank necessarily go also that numerous class of person in commercial city who depend altogether on bank credit for solvency and mean of business and who be therefore oblige for own safety to propitiate the favor of the money power by distinguished zeal and devotion in service the result of the ill advise legislation which establish this great monopoly be to concentrate the whole moneyed power of the union with boundless mean of corruption and numerous dependent under the direction and command of acknowledge head thus organize this particular interest as body and secure to unity and concert of action throughout the|united|state and enable to bring forward upon any occasion entire and undivided strength to support or defeat any measure of the government in the hand of this formidable power thus perfectly organize be also place unlimited dominion over the amount of the circulate medium give the power to regulate the value of property and the fruit of labor in every quarter of the union and to bestow prosperity or bring ruin upon any city or section of the country as may good comport with own interest or policy be not leave to conjecture how the moneyed power thus organize and with such a weapon in hand would be likely to use the distress and alarm which pervade and agitate the whole country when the|bank|of|the|united|states wag war upon the people in order to compel to submit to demand can not yet be forget the ruthless and unsparing temper with which whole city and community be oppress individual impoverish and ruin and a scene of cheerful prosperity suddenly change into of gloom and despondency ought to be indelibly impressed on the memory of the people of the|united|state if such be power in a time of peace what would not have be in a season of war with an enemy at door no nation but the freeman of the|united|state could have come out victorious from such a contest yet if have not conquer the government would have pass from the hand of the many to the hand of the few and this organized money power from secret conclave would have dictate the choice of high officer and compel to make peace or war as best suit own wish the form of government may for a time have remain but living spirit would have depart from the distress and suffering inflict on the people by the bank be some of the fruit of that system of policy which be continually strive to enlarge the authority of the|federal|government beyond the limit fix by the constitution the power enumerate in that instrument do not confer on congress the right to establish such a corporation as the|bank|of|the|united|state and the evil consequence which follow may warn of the danger of depart from the true rule of construction and of permit temporary circumstance or the hope of well promote the public welfare to influence in any degree decision upon the extent of the authority of let abide by the constitution as be write or amend in the constitutional mode if be find to be defective the severe lesson of experience will doubt not be sufficient to prevent congress from again charter such a monopoly even if the constitution do not present an insuperable objection to but must remember fellow citizen that eternal vigilance by the people be the price of liberty and that must pay the price if wish to secure the blessing behoove therefore to be watchful in states as well as in the power which the moneyed interest can exercise when concentrate under a single head and with present system of currency be sufficiently demonstrate in the struggle make by the|bank|of|the|united|state defeat in the|general|government tho same class of intriguer and politician will now resort to the states and endeavor to obtain there the same organization which fail to perpetuate in the union and with specious and deceitful plan of public advantage and state interest and state pride will endeavor to establish in the different states moneyed institution with overgrown capital and exclusive privilege sufficient to enable to control the operation of the other bank such an institution will be pregnant with the same evil produce by the|bank|of|the|united|state although sphere of action be more confined and in the state in which be charter the money power will be able to embody whole strength and to move together with undivided force to accomplish any object may wish to attain have already have abundant evidence of power to inflict injury upon the agricultural mechanical and laboring class of society and over those whose engagement in trade or speculation render dependent on bank facility the dominion of the state monopoly will be absolute and obedience unlimited with such a bank and a paper currency the money power would in a|few|year govern the state and control measure and if a sufficient number of state can be induce to create such establishment the time will soon come when will again take the field against the|united|state and succeed in perfect and perpetuate organization by a charter from congress be of the serious evil of present system of banking that enable class of society and that by no mean a numerous by control over the currency to act injuriously upon the interest of all the other and to exercise more than just proportion of influence in political affair the agricultural the mechanical and the laboring class have little or no share in the direction of the great moneyed corporation and from habit and the nature of pursuit be incapable of form extensive combination to act together with united force such concert of action may sometimes be produce in a single city or in a small district of country by mean of personal communication with each other but have no regular or active correspondence with those who be engage in similar pursuit in distant place have but little patronage to give to the press and exercise but a small share of influence over have no crowd of dependent about who hope to grow rich without labor by countenance and favor and who be therefore always ready to execute wish the planter the farmer the mechanic and the laborer all know that success depend upon own industry and economy and that must not expect to become suddenly rich by the fruit of toil yet these class of society form the great body of the people of the|united|state be the bone and sinew of the country man who love liberty and desire nothing but equal right and equal law and who moreover hold the great mass of national wealth although be distribute in moderate amount among the million of freeman who possess but with overwhelming number and wealth on side be in constant danger of lose fair influence in the government and with difficulty maintain just right against the incessant effort daily make to encroach upon the mischief spring from the power which the moneyed interest derive from a paper currency which be able to control from the multitude of corporation with exclusive privilege which have succeed in obtaining in the different states and which be employ altogether for benefit and unless become more watchful in states and check this spirit of monopoly and thirst for exclusive privilege will in the end find that the most important power of government have be give or barter away and the control over dear interest have pass into the hand of these corporation the paper money system and natural association monopoly and exclusive privilege have already strike root too deep in the soil and will require all effort to check further growth and to eradicate the evil the man who profit by the abuse and desire to perpetuate will continue to besiege the hall of legislation in the|general|government as well as in the states and will seek by every artifice to mislead and deceive the public servant be to yourself that must look for safety and the mean of guard and perpetuate free institution in hand be rightfully place the sovereignty of the country and to everyone place in authority be ultimately responsible be always in power to see that the wish of the people be carry into faithful execution and will when once make known must sooner or later be obey and while the people remain as trust ever will uncorrupted and incorruptible and continue watchful and jealous of right the government be safe and the cause of freedom will continue to triumph over all enemy but will require steady and persevere exertion on part to rid yourself of the iniquity and mischief of the paper system and to check the spirit of monopoly and other abuse which have spring up with and of which be the main support so many interest be united to resist all reform on this subject that must not hope the conflict will be a short one nor success easy humble effort have not be spare during administration of the government to restore the constitutional currency of gold and silver and something trust have be do toward the accomplishment of this most desirable object but enough yet remain to require all energy and perseverance the power however be in hand and the remedy must and will be apply if determine upon while be thus endeavor to press upon attention the principle which deem of vital importance in the domestic concern of the country ought not to pass over without notice the important consideration which should govern policy toward foreign power be unquestionably true interest to cultivate the most friendly understanding with every nation and to avoid by every honorable mean the calamity of war and shall best attain this object by frankness and sincerity in foreign intercourse by the prompt and faithful execution of treaty and by justice and impartiality in conduct to all but no nation however desirous of peace can hope to escape occasional collision with other power and the sound dictate of policy require that should place in a condition to assert right if a resort to force should ever become necessary local situation long line of seacoast indent by numerous bay with deep river open into the interior as well as extended and still increase commerce point to the navy as natural mean of defense will in the end be find to be the cheap and most effectual and now be the time in a season of peace and with an overflow revenue that can year after year add to strength without increase the burden of the people be true policy for navy will not only protect rich and flourish commerce in distant sea but will enable to reach and annoy the enemy and will give to defense great efficiency by meet danger at a distance from home be impossible by any line of fortification to guard every point from attack against a hostile force advance from the ocean and select object but be indispensable to protect city from bombardment dockyard

that the ultimate operation of the entire system have be to strengthen all the exist institution and to elevate whole country in prosperity and renown the last perhaps the great of the prominent

be deaf to dictate perceive before election the deep interest this subject be begin to excite believe a solemn duty fully to make know sentiment in regard to and now when every motive for misrepresentation have pass away trust that will be candidly weigh and understand at least will be standard of conduct in the path before then declare that if the desire of those of countryman who be favorable to election be gratify must go into the presidential chair the inflexible and uncompromising opponent of every attempt on the part of congress to abolish slavery in the|district|of|columbia against the wish of the slaveholde states and also with a determination equally decide to resist the slight interference with in the states where exist submit also to fellow citizen with fullness and frankness the reason which lead to this determination the result authorize to believe that have be approve and be confide in by a majority of the people of the|united|state include those whom most immediately affect now only remain to add that no bill conflict with these view can ever receive constitutional sanction these opinion have be adopt in the firm belief that be in accordance with the spirit that actuate the venerate father of the republic and that succeed experience have prove to be humane patriotic expedient honorable and just if the agitation of this subject be intend to reach the stability of institution enough have occur to show that have signally fail and that in this as in every other instance the apprehension of the timid and the hope of the wicked for the destruction of government be again destine to be disappoint here and there indeed scene of dangerous excitement have occur terrify instance of local violence have be witness and a reckless disregard of the

house|of|representatif of the|united|state during the last session information be give to congress by the executive that measure have be take to ascertain the political military and civil condition of texas now submit for consideration extract from the report of the agent who have be appoint to collect relative to the condition of that country no step have be take by the executive toward the acknowledgment of the independence of texas and the whole subject would have be leave without further remark on the information now give to congress be not that the houses at last session act separately pass resolution that the independence of texas ought to be acknowledge by the|united|state whenever satisfactory information should be receive that have in successful operation a civil government capable of perform the duty and fulfil the obligation of an independent power this mark of interest in the question of the independence of texas and indication of the view of congress make proper that should somewhat in detail present the consideration that have govern the executive in continue to occupy the ground previously take in the contest between mexico and texas the acknowledgment of a new state as independent and entitle to a place in the family of nation be at all time an act of great delicacy and responsibility but more especially so when such state have forcibly separate from another of which have form an integral part and which still claim dominion over a premature recognition under these circumstance if not look upon as justifiable cause of war be always liable to be regard as a proof of an unfriendly spirit to of the contend party all question relative to the government of foreign nation whether of the old or the new world have be treat by the|united|state as question of fact only and predecessor have cautiously abstain from decide upon until the clear evidence be in possession to enable not only to decide correctly but to shield decision from every unworthy imputation in all the contest that have arise out of the revolution of france out of the dispute relate to the crown of portugal and spain out of the revolutionary movement of those kingdoms out of the separation of the american possession of both from the|european|government and out of the numerous and constantly occur struggle for dominion in spanish|america so wisely consistent with just principle have be the action of government that have under the most critical circumstance avoid all censure and encounter no other evil than that produce by a transient estrangement of good will in those against whom have be by force of evidence compel to decide have thus be make known to the world that the uniform policy and practice of the|united|state be to avoid all interference in dispute which merely relate to the internal government of other nation and eventually to recognize the authority of the prevail party without reference to particular interest and view or to the merit of the original controversy public opinion here be so firmly establish and well understand in favor of this policy that no serious disagreement have ever arise among in relation to although bring under review in a variety of form and at period when the mind of the people be greatly excite by the agitation of topic purely domestic in character nor have any deliberate inquiry ever be institute in congress or in any of legislative body as to whom belong the power of originally recognize a new state a power the exercise of which be equivalent under some circumstance to a declaration of war a power nowhere expressly delegate and only grant in the constitution as be necessarily involve in some of the great power give to congress in that give to the president and senate to form treaty with foreign power and to appoint ambassador and other public minister and in that confer upon the president to receive minister from foreign nation in the preamble to the resolution of the|house|of|representatives be distinctly intimate that the expediency of recognize the independence of texas should be leave to the decision of congress in this view on the ground of expediency be dispose to concur and do not therefore consider necessary to express any opinion as to the strict constitutional right of the executive either apart from or in conjunction with the senate over the subject be to be presume that on no future occasion will a dispute arise as none have heretofore occur between the|executive|and|legislature in the exercise of the power of recognition will always be consider consistent with the spirit of the constitution and most safe that should be exercise when probably lead to war with a previous understanding with that body by whom war can alone be declare and by whom all the provision for sustain peril must be furnish submission to congress which represent in of branch of this union and in the other the people of the|united|state where there may be reasonable ground to apprehend so grave a consequence would certainly afford the full satisfaction to own country and a perfect guaranty to all other nation of the justice and prudence of the measure which may be adopt in make these suggestion be not purpose to relieve from the responsibility of express own opinion of the course the interest of country prescribe and honor permit to follow be scarcely to be imagine that a question of this character could be present in relation to which would be more difficult for the|united|state to avoid exciting the suspicion and jealousy of other power and maintain establish character for fair and impartial dealing but on this as on every try occasion safety be to be find in a rigid adherence to principle in the contest between spain and revolt colony stand aloof and wait not only until the ability of the new states to protect be fully establish but until the danger of be again subjugate have entirely pass away then and not till then be recognize such be course in regard to mexico the same policy be observe in all the dispute grow out of the separation into distinct government of those spanish|american states who begin or carry on the contest with the parent country unite under form of government acknowledge the separate independence of new|granada of venezuela and of ecuador only after independent existence be no longer a subject of dispute or be actually acquiesce in by those with whom have be previously unite be true that with regard to texas the civil authority of mexico have be expel invade army defeat the chief of the republic capture and all present power to control the newly organize government|of|texas annihilate within confine but on the other hand there be in appearance at least an immense disparity of physical force on the side of mexico the|mexican|republic under another executive be rally force under a new leader and menace a fresh invasion to recover lose dominion upon the issue of this threaten invasion the independence of texas may be consider as suspend and be there nothing peculiar in the relative situation of the|united|state and texas acknowledgment of independence at such a crisis could scarcely be regard as consistent with that prudent reserve with which have heretofore hold bind to treat all similar question but there be circumstance in the relation of the country which require to act on this occasion with even more than wonted caution texas be once claim as a part of property and there be those among citizen who always reluctant to abandon that claim can not but regard with solicitude the prospect of the reunion of the territory to this country a large proportion of civilized inhabitant be emigrant from the|united|state speak the same language with cherish the same principle political and religious and be bind to many of citizen by tie of friendship and kindre blood and more than all be know that the people of that country have institute the same form of government with own and have since the close of last session openly resolve on the acknowledgment by of independence to seek admission into the union as of the|federal|state this last circumstance be a matter of peculiar delicacy and force upon consideration of the grave character the title of texas to the territory claim be identify with independence ask to acknowledge that title to the territory with an avowed design to treat immediately of transfer to the|united|state become to beware of a too early movement as may subject however unjustly to the imputation of seek to establish the claim of neighbor to a territory with a view to subsequent acquisition by prudence therefore seem to dictate that should still stand aloof and maintain present attitude if not until mexico or of the great foreign power shall recognize the independence of the new government at least until the lapse of time or the course of event shall have prove beyond cavil or dispute the ability of the people of that country to maintain separate sovereignty and to uphold the government constitute by neither of the contend party can justly complain of this course by pursue be but carry out the long establish policy of government a policy which have secure to respect and influence abroad and inspire confidence at home have thus discharge duty by present with simplicity and directness the view which after much reflection have be lead to take of this important subject have only to add the expression of confidence that if congress shall differ with upon judgment will be the result of dispassionate prudent and wise deliberation with the assurance that during the short time shall continue connect with the government shall promptly and cordially unite with in such measure as may be deem best fit to increase the prosperity and perpetuate the peace of favor country transcript fellow citizen of the senate and house|of|representatif address to the last annual message shall ever present to be a source of the most heartfelt satisfaction to be able to congratulate on the high state of prosperity which beloved country have attain with no cause at home or abroad to lessen the confidence with which look to the future for continue proof of the capacity of free institution to produce all the fruit of good government the general condition of affair may well excite national pride can not avoid congratulate and country particularly on the success of the effort make during administration by the executive and legislature in conformity with the sincere constant and earnest desire of the people to maintain peace and establish cordial relation with all foreign power gratitude be due to the|supreme|ruler|of|the|universe and invite to unite with in offer to him fervent supplication that providential care may ever be extend to those who follow enable to avoid the danger and the horror of war consistently with a just and indispensable regard to the right and honor of country but although the present state of foreign affair stand without important change as do when separate in july last be flatter in the extreme regret to say that many question of an interesting character at issue with other power be yet unadjusted amongst the most prominent of these be that of northeast boundary with an undiminished confidence in the sincere desire of his|britannic|majesty 's government to adjust that question be not yet in possession of the precise ground upon which propose a satisfactory adjustment with france diplomatic relation have be resume and under circumstance which attest the disposition of both government to preserve a mutually beneficial intercourse and foster those amicable feeling which be so strongly require by the true interest of the country with russia austria prussia naples sweden and denmark the good understanding exist and commercial intercourse be gradually expand with be encourage in all these country except naples by mutually advantageous and liberal treaty stipulation with the claim of citizen on portugal be admit to be just but provision for the payment of have be unfortunately delay by frequent political change in that kingdom the blessing of peace have not be secure by spain connection with that country be on the good footing with the exception of the burden still impose upon commerce with possession out of europe the claim of american citizen for loss sustain at the bombardment of antwerp have be present to the government of holland and belgium and will be press in due season to settlement with brazil and all neighbor of this continent continue to maintain relation of amity and concord extend commerce with as far as the resource of the people and the policy of government will permit the just and long stand claim of citizen upon some of be yet source of dissatisfaction and complaint no danger be apprehend however that will not be peacefully although tardily acknowledge and pay by all unless the irritate effect of struggle with texas should unfortunately make immediate neighbor mexico an exception be already know to by the correspondence between the government communicate at last session that conduct in relation to that struggle be regulate by the same principle that govern in the dispute between spain and mexico and trust that will be find on the most severe scrutiny that act have strictly correspond with profession that the inhabitant of the|united|state should feel strong prepossession for the party be not surprising but this circumstance should of teach great caution lest lead into the great error of suffer public policy to be regulate by partially or prejudice and there be consideration connect with the possible result of this contest between the party of so much delicacy and importance to the|united|state that character require that should neither anticipate event nor attempt to control the know desire of the texans to become a part of system although gratification depend upon the reconcilement of various and conflicting interest necessarily a work of time and uncertain in be calculate to expose conduct to misconstruction in the eye of the world there be already those who indifferent to principle and prone to suspect the want of in other charge with ambitious design and insidious policy will perceive by the accompany document that the extraordinary mission from mexico have be terminate on the sole ground that the obligation of this government to and to mexico under treaty stipulation have compel to trust a discretionary authority to a high officer of army to advance into territory claim as part of texas if necessary to protect own or the neighboring frontier from indian depredation in the opinion of the mexican functionary who have just leave the honor of country will be wound by american soldier enter with the most amicable avowed purpose upon ground from which the follower of government have be expel and over which there be at present no certainty of a serious effort on part to re - establish dominion the departure of this minister be the more singular as be apprise that the sufficiency of the cause assign for the advance of troop by the command general have be seriously doubt by and there be every reason to suppose that the troop of the|united|state commander have have time to ascertain the truth or falsehood of the information upon which have be march to nacogdoches would be either there in perfect accordance with the principle admit to be just in conference with the secretary of state by the mexican minister or be already withdraw in consequence of the impressive warning command officer have receive from be hope and believe that government will take a more dispassionate and just view of this subject and not be dispose to construe a measure of justifiable precaution make necessary by known inability in execution of the stipulation of treaty to act upon the frontier into an encroachment upon right or a stain upon honor in the mean time the ancient complaint of injustice make on behalf of citizen be disregard and new cause of dissatisfaction have arise some of of a character require prompt remonstrance and ample and immediate redress trust however by tempering firmness with courtesy and act with great forbearance upon every incident that have occur or that may happen to do and to obtain justice and thus avoid the necessity of again bring this subject to the view of congress be duty to remind that no provision have be make to execute treaty with mexico for trace the boundary line between the country what ever may be the prospect of mexico 's be soon able to execute the treaty on part be proper that should be in anticipation prepare at all time to perform obligation without regard to the probable condition of those with whom have contract the result of the confidential inquiry make into the condition and prospect of the newly declare texan government will be communicate to in the course of the session commercial treaty promise great advantage to enterprise merchant and navigator have be form with the distant government of muscat and siam the ratification have be exchange but have not reach the|department|of|state cope of the treaty will be transmit to if receive before or publish if arrive after the close of the present session of congress nothing have occur to interrupt the good understanding that have long exist with the barbary power nor to check the good will which be gradually grow up from intercourse with the dominion of the government of grow of the distinguished chief of the|ottoman|empire information have be receive at the|department|of|state that a treaty with the emperor of morocco have just be negotiate which hope will be receive in time to be lay before the senate previous to the close of the session will perceive from the report of the secretary of the treasury that the financial mean of the country continue to keep pace with improvement in all other respect the receipt into the treasury during the|present|year will amount to about|$47,691,898 those from custom be estimate at those from land at about|$24,000,000 and the residue from miscellaneous source the expenditure for all object during the|year be estimate not to exceed which will leave a balance in the treasury for public purpose on the|first|day|of|january next of about|$41,723,959 this sum with the exception of will be transfer to the several state in accordance with the provision of the act regulate the deposit of the public money the unexpended balance of appropriation on the|first|day|of|january next be estimate at exceed by the amount which will be leave in the deposit bank subject to the draft of the treasurer of the|united|state after the contemplate transfer to the several state be make if therefore the future receipt should not be sufficient to meet these outstanding and future appropriation there may be soon a necessity to use a portion of the fund deposit with the state the consequence apprehend when the deposit act of the last session receive a reluctant approval have be measurably realize though an act merely for the deposit of the surplus money of the|united|state in the state treasury for safe keeping until may be want for the service of the general government have be extensively speak of as an act to give the money to the several state and have be advise to use as a gift without regard to the mean of refund when call for such a suggestion have doubtless be make without a proper attention to the various principle and interest which be affect by be manifest that the law can not sanction such a suggestion and that as now stand the states have no more authority to receive and use these deposit without intend to return than any deposit bank or any individual temporarily charge with the safe keeping or application of the public money would now have for convert the same to private use without the consent and against the will of the government but independently of the violation of public faith and moral obligation which be involve in this suggestion when examine in reference to the term of the present deposit act be believe that the consideration which should govern the future legislation of congress on this subject will be equally conclusive against the adoption of any measure recognize the principle on which the suggestion have be make consider the intimate connection of the subject with the financial interest of the country and great importance in whatever aspect can be view have bestow upon the most anxious reflection and feel to be duty to state to congress such thought as have occur to to aid deliberation in treat in the manner best calculate to conduce to the common good the experience of other nation admonish to hasten the extinguishment of the public debt but will be in vain that have congratulate each other upon the disappearance of this evil if do not guard against the equally great of promote the unnecessary accumulation of public revenue no political maxim be better establish than that which tell that an improvident expenditure of money be the parent of profligacy and that no people can hope to perpetuate liberty who long acquiesce in a policy which tax for object not necessary to the legitimate and real want of government flatter as be the condition of country at the present period because of unexampled advance in all the step of social and political improvement can not be disguise that there be a lurk danger already apparent in the neglect of this warning truth and that the time have arrive when the representative of the people should be employ in devise some more appropriate remedy than now exist to avert under present revenue system there be every probability that there will continue to be a surplus beyond the want of the government and have become duty to decide whether such a result be consistent with the true object of government should a surplus be permit to accumulate beyond the appropriation must be retain in the treasury as now be or distribute among the people or the state to retain in the treasury unemployed in any way be impracticable be besides against the genius of free institution to lock up in vault the treasure of the nation to take from the people the right of bear arm and put weapon of defense in the hand of a stand army would be scarcely more dangerous to liberty than to permit the government to accumulate immense amount of treasure beyond the supply necessary to legitimate want such a treasure would doubtless be employ at some time as have be in other country when opportunity tempt ambition to collect merely for distribution to the state would seem to be highly impolitic if not as dangerous as the proposition to retain in the treasury the short reflection must satisfy everyone that to require the people to pay taxis to the government merely that may be pay back again be sport with the substantial interest of the country and no system which produce such a result can be expect to receive the public countenance nothing could be gain by even if each individual who contribute a portion of the tax could receive back promptly the same portion but be apparent that no system of the kind can ever be enforce which will not absorb a considerable portion of the money to be distribute in salary and commission to the agent employ in the process and in the various loss and depreciation which arise from other cause and the practical effect of such an attempt must ever be to burden the people with taxis not for purpose beneficial to but to swell the profit of deposit bank and support a band of useless public officer a distribution to the people be impracticable and unjust in other respect would be take man 's property and give to another such would be the unavoidable result of a rule of equality and none other be speak of or would be likely to be adopt in as much as there be no mode by which the amount of the individual contribution of citizen to the public revenue can be ascertain know that contribute unequally and a rule therefore that would distribute to equally would be liable to all the objection which apply to the principle of an equal division of property to make the general government the instrument of carry this odious principle into effect would be at once to destroy the mean of usefulness and change the character design for by the framer of the constitution but the more extended and injurious consequence likely to result from a policy which would collect a surplus revenue from the purpose of distribute may be forcibly illustrate by an examination of the effect already produce by the present deposit act this act although certainly design to secure the safe keeping of the public revenue be not entirely free in tendency from any of the objection which apply to this principle of distribution the government have without necessity receive from the people a large surplus which instead of be employ as heretofore and return to by mean of the public expenditure be deposit with sundry bank the bank proceed to make loan upon this surplus and thus convert into banking capital and in this manner have tend to multiply bank charter and have have a great agency in produce a spirit of wild speculation the possession and use of the property out of which this surplus be create belong to the people but the government have transfer possession to incorporate bank whose interest and effort be to make large profit out of use this process nee only be state to show injustice and bad policy and the same observation apply to the influence which be produce by the step necessary to collect as well as to distribute such a revenue fifth of all the duty on import be pay in the city of new|york but be obvious that the mean to pay those duty be draw from every quarter of the union every citizen in every state who purchase and consume an article which have pay a duty at that port contribute to the accumulate mass the surplus collect there must therefore be make up of money or property withdraw from other point and other state thus the wealth and business of every region from which these surplus fund proceed must be to some extent injure while that of the place where the fund be concentrate and be employ in banking be proportionably extend but both in make the transfer of the fund which be first necessary to pay the duty and collect the surplus and in make the re - transfer which become necessary when the time arrive for the distribution of that surplus there be a considerable period when the fund can not be bring into use and be manifest that besides the loss inevitable from such an operation tendency be to produce fluctuation in the business of the country which be always productive of speculation and detrimental to the interest of regular trade argument can scarcely be necessary to show that a measure of this character ought not to receive further legislative encouragement by examine the practical operation of the ration for distribution adopt in the deposit bill of the last session shall discover other feature that appear equally objectionable let be assume for the sake of argument that the surplus money to be deposit with the state have be collect and belong to in the ration of federal representative population an assumption found upon the fact that any deficiency in future revenue from impost and public land must be make up by direct taxis collect from the state in that ration be propose to distribute this surplus — say accord to the ration in which have be collect and belong to the people of the state but in that of vote in the college of elector of president and vice president the effect of a distribution upon that ration be show by the annex table mark a. by an examination of that table will be perceive that in the distribution of a surplus of upon that basis there be a great departure from the principle which regard representation as the true measure of taxation and will be find that the tendency of that departure will be to increase whatever inequality have be suppose to attend the operation of federal system in respect to bearing upon the different interest of the union in make the basis of representation the basis of taxation the framer of the constitution intend to equalize the burden which be necessary to support the government and the adoption of that ratio while accomplish this object be also the mean of adjust other great topic arise out of the conflicting view respect the political equality of the various member of the confederacy what ever therefore disturb the liberal spirit of the compromise which establish a rule of taxation so just and equitable and which experience have prove to be so well adapt to the genius and habit of people should be receive with the great caution and distrust a bare inspection in the annexed table of the difference produce by the ration use in the deposit act compare with the result of a distribution accord to the ration of direct taxation must satisfy every unprejudiced mind that the former ration contravene the spirit of the constitution and produce a degree of injustice in the operation of the federal government which would be fatal to the hope of perpetuate by the ration of direct taxation for example the state of delaware in the collection of of revenue would pay into the treasury and in a distribution of would receive back from the government accord to the ration of the deposit bill the sum of and similar result would follow the comparison between the small and the large state throughout the union thus realize to the small state an advantage which would be doubtless as unacceptable to as a motive for incorporate the principle in any system which would produce as would be inconsistent with the right and expectation of the large state be certainly the intention of that provision of the constitution which declare that all duty impost and excise shall be uniform throughout the|united|state to make the burden of taxation fall equally upon the people in whatever state of the union may reside but what would be the value of such a uniform rule if the money raise by could be immediately return by a different one which will give to the people of some state much more and to those of other much less than fair proportion be the federal government to exempt in express term the import product and manufacture of some portion of the country from all duty while impose heavy one on other the injustice could not be great would be easy to show how by the operation of such a principle the large state of the union would not only have to contribute just share toward the support of the federal government but also have to bear in some degree the taxis necessary to support the government of small sister but be deem unnecessary to state the detail where the general principle be so obvious a system liable to such objection can never be suppose to have be sanction by the framer of the constitution when confer on congress the tax power and feel persuade that a mature examination of the subject will satisfy everyone that there be insurmountable difficulty in the operation of any plan which can be devise of collect revenue for the purpose of distribute congress be only authorize to levy taxis to pay the debt and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the|united|state there be no such provision as would authorize congress to collect together the property of the country under the name of revenue for the purpose of divide equally or unequally among the state or the people indeed be not probable that such an idea ever occur to the state when adopt the constitution but however this may be the only safe rule for in interpret the power grant to the federal government be to regard the absence of express authority to touch a subject so important and delicate as this as equivalent to a prohibition even if power be less doubtful in this respect as the constitution now stand there be consideration afford by recent experience which would seem to make duty to avoid a resort to such a system all will admit that the simplicity and economy of the state government mainly depend on the fact that money have to be supply to support by the same man or agent who vote away in appropriation hence when there be extravagant and wasteful appropriation there must be a corresponding increase of taxis and the people become awaken will necessarily scrutinize the character of measure which thus increase burden by the watchful eye of self interest the agent of the people in the state government be repress and keep within the limit of a just economy but if the necessity of levy the taxis be take from those who make the appropriation and throw upon a more distant and less responsible set of public agent who have power to approach the people by an indirect and stealthy taxation there be reason to fear that prodigality will soon supersede those characteristic which have thus far make look with so much pride and confidence to the state government as the mainstay of union and liberty the state legislature instead of study to restrict state expenditure to the small possible sum will claim credit for profusion and harass the general government for increase supply practically there would soon be but tax power and that vest in a body of man far remove from the people in which the farming and mechanic interest would scarcely be represent the state would gradually lose purity as well as independence would not dare to murmur at the proceeding of the general government lest should lose supply all would be merge in a practical consolidation cement by widespread corruption which could only be eradicate by of those bloody revolution which occasionally overthrow the despotic system of the old world in all the other aspect in which have be able to look at the effect of such a principle of distribution upon the good interest of the country can see nothing to compensate for the disadvantage to which have advert if consider the protective duty which be in a great degree the source of the surplus revenue beneficial to section of the union and prejudicial to another there be no corrective for the evil in such a plan of distribution on the contrary there be reason to fear that all the complaint which have spring from this cause would be aggravate everyone must be sensible that a distribution of the surplus must beget a disposition to cherish the mean which create and any system therefore into which enter must have a powerful tendency to increase rather than diminish the tariff if be even admit that the advantage of such a system could be make equal to all the section of the union the reason already so urgently call for a reduction of the revenue would never the less lose none of force for will always be improbable that an intelligent and virtuous community can consent to raise a surplus for the mere purpose of divide diminish as must inevitably be by the expense of the various machinery necessary to the process the safe and simplest mode of obviate all the difficulty which have be mention be to collect only revenue enough to meet the want of the government and let the people keep the balance of property in own hand to be use for own profit each state will then support own government and contribute due share toward the support of the general government there would be no surplus to cramp and lessen the resource of individual wealth and enterprise and the bank would be leave to ordinary mean whatever agitation and fluctuation may arise from unfortunate paper system could never be attribute justly or unjustly to the action of the federal government there would be some guaranty that the spirit of wild speculation which seek to convert the surplus revenue into banking capital would be effectually check and that the scene of demoralization which be now so prevalent through the land would disappear without desire to conceal that the experience and observation of the|last|two|year have operate a partial change in view upon this interesting subject be never the less regretted that the suggestion make by in annual message of and have be greatly misunderstood at that time the great struggle be begin against that latitudinarian construction of the constitution which authorize the unlimited appropriation of the revenue of the union to internal improvement within the state tend to invest in the hand and place under the control of the general government all the principal road and canal of the country in violation of state right and in derogation of state authority at the same time the condition of the manufacturing interest be such as to create an apprehension that the duty on import could not without extensive mischief be reduce in season to prevent the accumulation of a considerable surplus after the payment of the national debt in view of the danger of such a surplus and in preference to application to internal improvement in derogation of the right and power of the state the suggestion of an amendment of the constitution to authorize distribution be make be an alternative for what be deem great evil a temporary resort to relieve an over burden treasury until the government could without a sudden and destructive revulsion in the business of the country gradually return to the just principle of raise no more revenue from the people in taxis than be necessary for economical support even that alternative be not speak of but in connection with an amendment of the constitution no temporary inconvenience can justify the exercise of a prohibit power not grant by that instrument and be from a conviction that the power to distribute even a temporary surplus of revenue be of that character that be suggest only in connection with an appeal to the source of all legal power in the general government the state which have establish no such appeal have be take and in opinion a distribution of the surplus revenue by congress either to the state or the people be to be consider as among the prohibition of the constitution as already intimate view have undergo a change so far as to be convince that no alteration of the constitution in this respect be wise or expedient the influence of an accumulating surplus upon the credit system of the country produce dangerous extension and ruinous contraction fluctuation in the price of property rash speculation idleness extravagance and a deterioration of moral have teach the important lesson that any transient mischief which may attend the reduction of revenue to the want of government be to be bear in preference to an overflowing treasury beg leave to call attention to another subject intimately associate with the precede the currency of the country be apparent from the whole context of the constitution as well as the history of the time which give birth to that be the purpose of the convention to establish a currency consist of the precious metal these from peculiar property which render the standard of value in all other country be adopt in this as well to establish commercial standard in reference to foreign country by a permanent rule as to exclude the use of a mutable medium of exchange such as of certain agricultural commodity recognize by the statute of some state as a tender for debt or the still more pernicious expedient of a paper currency the last from the experience of the evil of the issue of paper during the revolution have become so justly obnoxious as not only to suggest the clause in the constitution forbid the emission of bill of credit by the state but also to produce that vote in the convention which negative the proposition to grant power to congress to charter corporation a proposition well understand at the time as intend to authorize the establishment of a national bank which be to issue a currency of bank note on a capital to be create to some extent out of government stock although this proposition be refuse by a direct vote of the convention the object be afterwards in effect obtain by ingenious advocate through a strained construction of the constitution the debt of the revolution be fund at price which form no equivalent compare with the nominal amount of the stock and under circumstance which expose the motif of some of those who participate in the passage of the act to distrust the fact that the value of the stock be greatly enhance by the creation of the bank that be well understand that such would be the case and that some of the advocate of the measure be largely benefit by belong to the history of the time and be well calculated to diminish the respect which may otherwise have be due to the action of the congress which create the institution on the establishment of a national bank become the interest of creditor that gold should be supersede by the paper of the bank as a general currency a value be soon attach to the gold coin which make exportation to foreign country as a mercantile commodity more profitable than retention and use at home as money follow as a matter of course if not design by those who establish the bank that the bank become in effect a substitute for the mint of the|united|state such be the origin of a national bank currency and such the beginning of those difficulty which now appear in the excessive issue of the bank incorporate by the various states although may not be possible by any legislative mean within power to change at once the system which have thus be introduce and have receive the acquiescence of all portion of the country be certainly duty to do all that be consistent with constitutional obligation in prevent the mischief which be threaten by undue extension that the effort of the father of government to guard against by a constitutional provision be found on an intimate knowledge of the subject have be frequently attest by the bitter experience of the country the same cause which lead to refuse sanction to a power authorize the establishment of incorporation for banking purpose now exist in a much strong degree to urge to exert the utmost vigilance in call into action the mean necessary to correct the evil result from the unfortunate exercise of the power and be hope that the opportunity for effect this great good will be improve before the country witness new scene of embarrassment and distress variableness must ever be the characteristic of a currency of which the precious metal be not the chief ingredient or which can be expand or contract without regard to the principle that regulate the value of those metal as a standard in the general trade of the world with bank issue constitute such a currency and must ever do so until be make dependent on those just proportion of gold and silver as a circulate medium which experience have prove to be necessary not only in this but in all other commercial country where those proportion be not infuse into the circulation and do not control be manifest that price must vary accord to the tide of bank issue and the value and stability of property must stand expose to all the uncertainty which attend the administration of institution that be constantly liable to the temptation of an interest distinct from that of the community in which be establish the progress of an expansion or rather a depreciation of the currency by excessive bank issue be always attend by a loss to the laboring class this portion of the community have neither time nor opportunity to watch the ebb and flow of the money market engage from day to day in useful toil do not perceive that although wage be nominally the same or even somewhat high be greatly reduce in fact by the rapid increase of a spurious currency which as appear to make money abound be at first incline to consider a blessing be not so with the speculator by whom this operation be better understand and be make to contribute to advantage be not until the price of the necessary of life become so dear that the laboring class can not supply want out of wage that the wage rise and gradually reach a justly proportion rate to that of the product of labor when thus by depreciation in consequence of the quantity of paper in circulation wage as well as price become exorbitant be soon find that the whole effect of the adulteration be a tariff on home industry for the benefit of the country where gold and silver circulate and maintain uniformity and moderation in price be then perceive that the enhancement of the price of land and labor produce a corresponding increase in the price of product until these product do not sustain a competition with similar one in other country and thus both manufacture and agricultural production cease to bear expectation from the country of the spurious currency because can not be sell for cost this be the process by which specie be banish by the paper of the bank vault be soon exhaust to pay for foreign commodity the next step be a stoppage of specie payment a total degradation of paper as a currency unusual depression of price the ruin of debtor and the accumulation of property in the hand of creditor and cautious capitalist be in view of these evil together with the dangerous power wield by the|bank|of|the|united|state and repugnance to constitution that be induce to exert the power confer upon by the american people to prevent the continuance of that institution but although various danger to republican institution have be obviate by the failure of that bank to extort from the government a renewal of charter be obvious that little have be accomplish except a salutary change of public opinion toward restore to the country the sound currency provide for in the constitution in the act of several of the state prohibit the circulation of small note and the auxiliary enactment of congress at the last session forbid reception or payment on public account the true policy of the country have be advance and a large portion of the precious metal infuse into circulate medium these measure will probably be follow up in due time by the enactment of state law banish from circulation bank note of still high denomination and the object may be materially promote by further act of congress forbid the employment as fiscal agent of such bank as continue to issue note of low denomination and throw impediment in the way of the circulation of gold and silver the effect of an extension of bank credit and over issue of bank paper have be strikingly illustrate in the sale of the public land from the return make by the various register and receiver in the early part of last|summer be perceive that the receipt arise from the sale of the public land be increase to an unprecedented amount in effect however these receipt amount to nothing more than credit in bank the bank lend out note to speculator be pay to the receiver and immediately return to the bank to be lend out again and again be mere instrument to transfer to speculator the most valuable public land and pay the government by a credit on the book of the bank those credit on the book of some of the western bank usually call deposit be already greatly beyond immediate mean of payment and be rapidly increase indeed each speculation furnish mean for another for no sooner have individual or company pay in the note than be immediately lend to another for a like purpose and the bank be extend business and issue so largely as to alarm considerate man and render doubtful whether these bank credit if permit to accumulate would ultimately be of the least value to the government the spirit of expansion and speculation be not confine to the deposit bank but pervade the whole multitude of bank throughout the union and be give rise to new institution to aggravate the evil the safety of the public fund and the interest of the people generally require that these operation should be check and become the duty of every branch of the general and state government to adopt all legitimate and proper mean to produce that salutary effect under this view of duty direct the issuing of the order which will be lay before by the secretary of the treasury require payment for the public land sell to be make in specie with an exception until the|15th|of|the|present|month in favor of actual settler this measure have produce many salutary consequence check the career of the western bank and give additional strength in anticipation of the pressure which have since pervade eastern as well as the european commercial city by prevent the extension of the credit system measurably cut off the mean of speculation and retard progress in monopolize the most valuable of the public land have tend to save the new state from a non - resident proprietorship of the great obstacle to the advancement of a new country and the prosperity of an old have tend to keep open the public land for entry by emigrant at government price instead of be compel to purchase of speculator at double or triple price and be convey into the interior large sum in silver and gold there to enter permanently into the currency of the country and place on a firm foundation be confidently believe that the country will find in the motif which induce that order and the happy consequence which will have ensue much to commend and nothing to condemn remain for congress if approve the policy which dictate this order to follow up in various bearing much good in judgment would be produce by prohibit sale of the public land except to actual settler at a reasonable reduction of price and to limit the quantity which shall be sell to although be believe the general government never ought to receive anything but the constitutional currency in exchange for the public land that point would be of less importance if the land be sell for immediate settlement and cultivation indeed there be scarcely a mischief arise out of present land system include the accumulate surplus of revenue which would not be remedie at once by a restriction on land sale to actual settler and promise other advantage to the country in general and to the new state in particular which can not fail to receive the most profound consideration of congress experience continue to realize the expectation entertain as to the capacity of the state bank to perform the duty of fiscal agent for the government at the time of the removal of the deposit be allege by the advocate of the|bank|of|the|united|state that the state bank what ever may be the regulation of the|treasury|department could not make the transfer require by the government or negotiate the domestic exchange of the country be now well ascertain that the real domestic exchange perform through discount by the|united|states|bank and branch be at|least|one third less than those of the deposit bank for an equal period of time and if a comparison be institute between the amount of service render by these institution on the broad basis which have be use by the advocate of the|united|states|bank in estimate what consider the domestic exchange transact by the result will be still more favorable to the deposit bank the whole amount of public money transfer by the|bank|of|the|united|state in be the amount transfer and actually pay by the deposit bank in the|year|ending|the|1st|of|october|last be the amount transfer and pay between that period and the 6th of november be and the amount of transfer warrant outstanding on that|day be make an aggregate of these enormous sum of money first mention have be transfer with the great promptitude and regularity and the rate at which the exchange have be negotiate previously to the passage of the deposit act be generally below those charge by the|bank|of|the|united|state independently of these service which be far great than those render by the|united|states|bank and branch a number of the deposit bank have with a commendable zeal to aid in the improvement of the currency import from abroad at own expense large sum of the precious metal for coinage and circulation in the same manner have nearly all the prediction turn out in respect to the effect of the removal of the deposit a step unquestionably necessary to prevent the evil which be foresee the bank would endeavor to create in a final struggle to procure a renewal of charter may be thus too in some degree with the further step which may be take to prevent the excessive issue of other bank paper but be to be hope that nothing will now deter the federal and state authority from the firm and vigorous performance of duty to and to the people in this respect in reduce the revenue to the want of the government particular attention be invite to those article which constitute the necessary of life the duty on salt be lay as a war tax and be no doubt continue to assist in provide for the payment of the war debt there be no article the release of which from taxation would be feel so generally and so beneficially to this may be add all kind of fuel and provision justice and benevolence unite in favor of release the poor of city from burden which be not necessary to the support of government and tend only to increase the want of the destitute will be see by the report of the secretary of the treasury and the accompany document that the|bank|of|the|united|state have make no payment on account of the stock hold by the government in that institution although urge to pay any portion which may suit convenience and that have give no information when payment may be expect nor although repeatedly request have furnish the information in relation to condition which congress authorize the secretary to collect at last session such measure as be within the power of the executive have be take to ascertain the value of the stock and procure the payment as early as possible the conduct and present condition of that bank and the great amount of capital vest in by the|united|state require careful attention charter expire on the|third|day|of|march last and have now no power but that give in the|21st section to use the corporate name style and capacity for the purpose of suit for the final settlement and liquidation of the affair and account of the corporation and for the sale and disposition of estate — real personal and mixed — but not for any other purpose or in any other manner what so ever nor for a period exceed two|year after the expiration of the said term of incorporation before the expiration of the charter the stock holder of the bank obtain an act of incorporation from the legislature of pennsylvania exclude only the|united|state instead of proceed to wind up concern and pay over to the|united|state the amount due on account of the stock hold by the president and director of the old bank appear to have transfer the book paper note obligation and most or all of property to this new corporation which enter upon business as a continuation of the old concern amongst other act of questionable validity the note of the expire corporation be know to have be use as own and again put in circulation that the old bank have no right to issue or re - issue note after the expiration of charter can not be deny and that could not confer any such right on substitute any more than exercise be equally plain in law and honesty the note of the bank in circulation at the expiration of charter should have be call in by public advertisement pay up as present and together with those on hand cancel and destroy re - issue be sanction by no law and warrant by no necessity if the|united|state be responsible in stock for the payment of these note re - issue by the new corporation for own profit be a fraud on the government if the|united|state be not responsible then there be no legal responsibility in any|quarter and be a fraud on the country be the redeem note of a dissolve partnership but contrary to the wish of the retire partner and without consent be again re - issue and circulate be the high and peculiar duty of congress to decide whether any further legislation be necessary for the security of the large amount of public property now hold and in use by the new bank and for vindicate the right of the government and compel a speedy and honest settlement with all the creditor of the old bank public and private or whether the subject shall be leave to the power now possess by the executive and judiciary remain to be see whether the person who as manager of the old bank undertake to control the government retain the public dividend shut door upon a committee of the|house|of|representatives and fill the country with panic to accomplish own sinister object may now as manager of a new bank continue with impunity to flood the country with a spurious currency use the of government stock for own profit and refuse to the|united|states all information as to the present condition of own property and the prospect of recover into own possession the lesson teach by the|bank|of|the|united|state can not well be lose upon the american people will take care never again to place so tremendous a power in irresponsible hand and will be fortunate if seriously consider the consequence which be likely to result on a small scale from the facility with which corporate power be grant by state government be believe that the law of the last session regulate the deposit bank operate onerously and unjustly upon in many respect and be hope that congress on proper representation will adopt the modification which be necessary to prevent this consequence the report of the secretary of war ad interim and the accompany document all which be herewith lay before will give a full view of the diversified and important operation of that department during the|past|year the military movement render necessary by the aggression of the hostile portion of the seminole and creek tribe of indians and by other circumstance have require the active employment of nearly whole regular force include the|marine|corps and of large body of militia and volunteer with all these event so far as be know at the seat of government before the termination of last session be already acquaint and be therefore only needful in this place to lay before a brief summary of what have since occur the war with the seminoles during the|summer be on part chiefly confine to the protection of frontier settlement from the incursion of the enemy and as a necessary and important mean for the accomplishment of that end to the maintenance of the post previously establish in the course of this duty several action take place in which the bravery and discipline of both officer and man be conspicuously display and which have deem proper to notice in respect to the former by the granting of brevet rank for gallant service in the field but as the force of the indians be not so far weaken by these partial success as to lead to submit and as savage inroad be frequently repeat early measure be take for place at the disposal of governor call who as commander in chief of the territorial militia have be temporarily invest with the command an ample force for the purpose of resume offensive operation in the most efficient manner so soon as the season should permit major general jesup be also direct on the conclusion of duty in the creek country to repair to florida and assume the command the result of the first movement make by the force under the direction of governor|call in october|last as detail in the accompany paper excite much surprise and disappointment a full explanation have be require of the cause which lead to the failure of that movement but have not yet be receive in the mean time as be fear that the health of governor call who be understand to have suffer much from sickness may not be adequate to the crisis and as major general jesup be know to have reach florida that officer be direct to assume command and to prosecute all needful operation with the utmost promptitude and vigor from the force at disposal and the disposition have make and be instruct to make and from the very efficient measure which be since ascertain have be take by governor call there be reason to hope that will soon be enable to reduce the enemy to subjection in the mean time as will perceive from the report of the secretary there be urgent necessity for further appropriation to suppress these hostility happily for the interest of humanity the hostility with the creeks be bring to a close soon after adjournment without that effusion of blood which at time be apprehend as inevitable the unconditional submission of the hostile party be follow by speedy removal to the country assign west of the mississippi the inquiry as to allege fraud in the purchase of the reservation of these indians and the cause of hostility request by the resolution of the|house|of|representatives of the 1st of july last to be make by the president be now go on through the agency of commissioner appoint for that purpose report may be expect during present session the difficulty apprehend in the cherokee country have be prevent and the peace and safety of that region and vicinity effectually secure by the timely measure take by and still continue the discretionary authority give to general gaines to cross the sabine and to occupy a position as far west as nacogdoches in case should deem such a step necessary to the protection of the frontier and to the fulfillment of the stipulation contain in treaty with mexico and the movement subsequently make by that officer have be allude to in a former part of this message at the date of the late intelligence from nacogdoches troop be yet at that station but the officer who have succeed general gaines have recently be advise that from the fact know at the seat of government there would seem to be no adequate cause for any longer maintain that position and be accordingly instruct in case the troop be not already withdraw under the discretionary power before possess by to give the requisite order for that purpose on the receipt of the instruction unless shall then have in possession such information as shall satisfy that the maintenance of the post be essential to the protection of frontier and to the due execution of treaty stipulation as previously explain to whilst the necessity exist during the|present|year for the service of militia and volunteer have furnish new proof of the patriotism of fellow citizen have also strongly illustrate the importance of an increase in the rank and file of the regular army the view of this subject submit by the secretary of war in report meet entire concurrence and be earnestly commend to the deliberate attention of congress in this connection be also proper to remind that the defect in present militia system be every day render more apparent the duty of make further provision by law for organizing arming and discipline this arm of defense have be so repeatedly present to congress by and predecessor that deem sufficient on this occasion to refer to the last annual message and to former executive communication in which the subject have be discuss appear from the report of the officer charge with muster into service the volunteer call for under the act of congress of the last session that more present at the place of rendezvous in tennessee than be sufficient to meet the requisition which have be make by the secretary of war upon the governor of that state this be occasion by the omission of the governor to apportion the requisition to the different regiment of militia so as to obtain the proper number of troop and no more seem but just to the patriotic citizen who repair to the general rendezvous under circumstance authorize to believe that service be need and would be accept that the expense incur by while absent from home should be pay by the government accordingly recommend that a law to this effect be pass by congress give a compensation which will cover expense on the march to and from the place of rendezvous and while there in connection with which will also be proper to make provision for such other equitable claim grow out of the service of the militia as may not be embrace in the exist law on the unexpected breaking out of hostility in florida alabama and georgia become necessary in some case to take the property of individual for public use provision should be make by law for indemnify the owner and would also respectfully suggest whether some provision may not be make consistently with the principle of government for the relief of the sufferer by indian depredation or by the operation of own troop no time be lose after the making of the requisite appropriation in resume the great national work of complete the unfinished fortification on sea board and of place in a proper state of defense in consequence however of the very late day at which those bill be pass but little progress could be make during the|season which have just close a very large amount of the money grant at last session accordingly remain unexpended but as the work will be again resume at the early moment in the|coming|spring the balance of the exist appropriation and in several case which will be lay before with the proper estimate further sum for the like object may be usefully expend during the|next|year the recommendation of an increase in the|engineer|corp and for a reorganization of the|topographical|corp submit to in last annual message derive additional strength from the great embarrassment experience during the|present|year in those branch of the service and under which be now suffer several of the most important survey and construction direct by recent law have be suspend in consequence of the want of adequate force in these corp the like observation may be apply to the|ordnance|corps and to the general staff the operation of which as be now organized must either be frequently interrupt or perform by officer take from the line of the army to the great prejudice of the service for a general view of the condition of the military academy and of other branch of the military service not already notice as well as for further illustration of those which have be mention refer to the accompany document and among the various proposal contain therein for legislative action would particularly notice the suggestion of the secretary of war for the revision of the pay of the army as entitle to favorable regard the national policy found alike in interest and in humanity so long and so steadily pursue by this government for the removal of the indian tribe originally settle on this side of the mississippi to the west of that river may be say to have be consummate by the conclusion of the late treaty with the cherokees the measure take in the execution of that treaty and in relation to indian affair generally will fully appear by refer to the accompany paper without dwell on the numerous and important topic embrace in again invite attention to the importance of provide a well digest and comprehensive system for the protection supervision and improvement of the various tribe now plant in the indian country the suggestion submit by the commissioner of indian|affairs and enforce by the secretary on this subject and also in regard to the establishment of additional military post in the indian country be entitle to profound consideration both measure be necessary for the double purpose of protect the indians from intestine war and in other respect comply with engagement with and of secure western frontier against incursion which otherwise will assuredly be make on the good hope of humanity in regard to the aboriginal race the welfare of rapidly extend settlement and the honor of the|united|state be all deeply involved in the relation exist between this government and the emigrate tribe trust therefore that the various matter submit in the accompany document in respect to those relation will receive early and mature deliberation and that may issue in the adoption of legislative measure adapt to the circumstance and duty of the present crisis be refer to the report of the secretary of the navy for a satisfactory view of the operation of the department under charge during the|present|year in the construction of vessel at the different navy yard and in the employment of ship and squadron at sea that branch of the service have be actively and usefully employ while the situation of commercial interest in the west indies require a great number than usual of armed vessel to be keep on that station be gratify to perceive that the protection due to commerce in other quarter of the world have not prove insufficient every effort have be make to facilitate the equipment of the explore expedition authorize by the act of the last session but all the preparation necessary to enable to sail have not yet be complete no means will be spare by the government to fit out the expedition on a scale correspond with the liberal appropriation for the purpose and with the elevated character of the object which be to be effect by beg leave to renew the recommendation make in last annual message respect the enlistment of boy in naval service and to urge upon attention the necessity of further appropriation to increase the number of ship afloat and to enlarge generally the capacity and force

particular attention be invite to the subject of mail contract with railroad company the present law provide for the making of contract be base upon the presumption that competition among bidder will secure the service at a fair price but on most of the railroad line there be no competition in that kind of transportation and advertising be therefore useless no contract can now be make with except such as shall be negotiate before the time of offering or afterwards and the power of the|postmaster|general to pay high price be practically without limitation would be a relief to and no doubt would conduce to the public interest to prescribe by law some equitable basis upon which such contract shall rest and restrict by a fix rule of allowance under a liberal act of that sort would undoubtedly be able to secure the service of most of the railroad company and the interest of the department would be thus advanced the correspondence between the people of the|united|state and the european nation and particularly with the|british|island have become very extensive and require the interposition of congress to give security no obstacle be perceive to an interchange of mail between new|york

congress in order to obtain that sanction the subject be at the last session on suggestion and by request of the immediate superintendent submit by the|treasury|department to the|committee|on|commerce|of|the|house|of|representatif but no legislative action have take place the early attention of congress be now invite to the enactment of some express and detailed provision in relation to the various claim make for the past and to the compensation and allowance deem proper for the future be further respectfully recommend that such be the inconvenience of attention to these duty by the chief magistrate and such the great pressure of business on the|treasury|department the general supervision of the coast survey and the completion of the weight and measure if the work be keep unite should be devolve on a board of officer organize specially for that purpose or on attach to the|navy|department all experience and reflection confirm the conviction have so often express to congress in favor of an amendment of the constitution which will prevent in any event the election of the president and vice president of the|united|state devolve on the|house|of|representatives and the senate and therefore beg leave again to solicit attention to the subject there be various other suggestion in last annual message not act upon particularly that relate to the want of uniformity in the law of the|district|of|columbia that be deem worthy of favorable consideration before conclude this paper think due to the various executive department to bear testimony to prosperous condition and to the ability and integrity with which have be conduct have be aim to enforce in all of a vigilant and faithful discharge of the public business and be gratify

progress have be make great|britain have decline accede to the proposition of the|united|state present in accordance with the resolution of the senate unless certain preliminary condition be admit which deem incompatible with a satisfactory and rightful adjustment of the controversy wait for some distinct proposal from the|government|of|great|britain which have be invite can only repeat the expression of confidence that with the strong mutual disposition which believe exist to make a just arrangement this perplex question can be settle with a due regard to the well found pretension and pac ific policy of all the party to event be frequently occur on the north|eastern frontier of a character to impress upon all the necessity of a speedy and definitive termination of the dispute this consideration add to the desire common to both to relieve the liberal and friendly relation so happily exist between the country from all embarrassment will no doubt have just influence upon both diplomatic intercourse with portugal have be renew and be expect that the claim of citizen partially pay will be fully satisfied as soon as the condition of the|queen's|government will permit the proper attention to the subject of that government have be happy to inform manifest a determination to act upon the liberal principle which have mark commercial policy the happy effect upon the future trade between the|united|state and portugal be anticipate from and the time be not think to be remote when a system of perfect reciprocity will be establish the installment due under the convention with the|king|of|the two sicilies have be pay with that scrupulous fidelity by which whole conduct have be characterize and the hope be indulge that the adjustment of the vexed question of claim will be follow by a more extended and mutually beneficial intercourse between the country the internal contest still continue in spain distinguish as this struggle have unhappily be by incident of the most sanguinary character the obligation of the late treaty of indemnification with have be never the less faithfully execute by the|spanish|government no provision have be make at the last session of congress for the ascertainment of the claim to be pay and the apportionment of the fund under the convention make with spain invite early attention to the subject the public evidence of the debt have accord to the term of the convention and in the form prescribe by be place in the possession of the|united|state and the interest as fall due have be regularly pay upon commercial intercourse with cuba stand as regulate by the act of congress no recent information have be receive as to the disposition of the|government|of|madrid and the lamented death of recently appoint minister on way to spain with the pressure of affair at home render scarcely probable that any change be to be look for during the|coming|year further portion of the florida archive have be send to the|united|state although the death of of the commissioner at a critical moment embarrass the progress of the delivery of the high officer of the local government have recently show an anxious desire in compliance with the order from the parent government to facilitate the selection and delivery of all have a right to claim negotiation have be open at madrid for the establishment of a last peace between spain and such of the spanish american government of this hemisphere as have avail of the intimation give to all of of the disposition of spain to treat upon the basis of entire independence be to be regret that simultaneous appointment by all of minister to negotiate with spain have not be make the negotiation would have be simplify and this long stand dispute spread over a large portion of the world would have be bring to a more speedy conclusion political and commercial relation with austria prussia sweden and denmark stand on the usual favorable basis of the article of treaty with russia in relation to the trade on the north west coast of america have expire instruction have be give to minister at st.|petersburg to negotiate a renewal of the long and unbroken amity between the government give every reason for suppose the article will be renew if strong motif do not exist to prevent than with view of the subject can be anticipate here ask attention to the message of predecessor at the opening of the second session fo the 19th congress relative to commercial intercourse with holland and to the document connect with that subject communicate to the|house|of|representatives on the|10th|of|january,|1825 and in the opinion of predecessor that holland be not under the regulation of present system entitle to have vessel and cargo receive into the|united|state on the footing of american vessel and cargo as regard duty of tonnage and impost a respect for reference of to the legislature have alone prevent from act on the subject should still have wait without comment for the action of congress but recently a claim have be make by belgian subject to admission into port for ship and cargo on the same footing as american with the allegation could not dispute that vessel receive in port the identical treatment shew to in the port of holland upon whose vessel no discrimination be make in the port of the|united|state give the same privilege the belgians expect the same benefit benefit that be in fact enjoy when belgium and holland be unite under government satisfy with the justice of pretension to be place on the same footing with holland could not never the less without disregard to the principle of law admit claim to be treat as americans and at the same time a respect for congress to whom the subject have long since be refer have prevent from produce a just equality by take from the vessel of holland privilege conditionally grant by act of congress although the condition upon which the grant be make have in judgment fail since recommend therefore a review of the|act|of|1824 and such modification of as will produce an equality on such term as congress shall think good comport with settle policy and the obligation of justice to friendly power with the sublime porte and all the government on the coast of barbary relation continue to be friendly the proper step have be take to renew treaty with morocco the|argentine|republic have again promise to send within the|current|year a minister to the|united|state a convention with mexico for extend the time for the appointment of commissioner to run the boundary line have be conclude and will be submit to the senate recent event in that country have awaken the lively solicitude in the|united|state aware of the strong temptation exist and powerful inducement hold out to the citizen of the|united|state to mingle in the dissension of immediate neighbor instruction have be give to the district attorney of the|united|state where indication warrant to prosecute without respect to person all who may attempt to violate the obligation of neutrality while at the same time have be think necessary to apprise the government|of|mexico that should require the integrity of territory to be scrupulously respect by both party from diplomatic agent in brazil chile peru central|america venezuela and new|granada constant assurance be receive of the continue good understanding with the government to which be severally accredit with those government upon which citizen have valid and accumulate claim scarcely an advance toward a settlement of be make owe mainly to distracted state or to the pressure of imperative domestic question patience have be and will probably be still further severely try but fellow citizen whose interest be involve may confide in the determination of the government to obtain for eventually ample retribution unfortunately many of the nation of this hemisphere be still self torment by domestic dissension revolution succeed revolution injury be commit upon foreigner engage in lawful pursuit much time el apse before a government sufficiently stable be erect to justify expectation of redress minister be send and receive and before the discussion of past injury be fairly begin fresh trouble arise but too frequently new injury be add to the old to be discuss together with the exist government after have prove ability to sustain the assault make upon or with successor if overthrow if this unhappy condition of thing continue much longer other nation will be under the painful necessity of decide whether justice to suffering citizen do not require a prompt redress of injury by own power without wait for the establishment of a government competent and endure enough to discuss and to make satisfaction for since the last session of congress the validity of claim upon france as liquidate by the|treaty|of|1831 have be acknowledge by both branch of legislature and the money have be appropriate for discharge but the payment be regret to inform still withhold a brief recapitulation of the most important incident in this protract controversy will shew how utterly untenable be the ground upon which this course be attempt to be justify on enter upon the duty of station find the|united|state an unsuccessful applicant to the justice of france for the satisfaction of claim the validity of which be never questionable and have now be most solemnly admit by france the antiquity of these claim high justice and the aggravate circumstance out of which arise be too familiar to the american people to require description be sufficient to say that for a period of and upward commerce be with but little interruption the subject of constant aggression on the part of france aggression the ordinary feature of which be condemnation of vessel and cargo under arbitrary decree adopt in contravention as well of the law of nation as of treaty stipulation burning on the high sea and seizure and confiscation under special imperial rescript in the port of other nation occupy by the army or under the control of france such be now concede be the character of the wrong suffer wrong in many case so flagrant that even author never deny right to reparation of the extent of these injury some conception may be form from the fact that after the burning of a large amount at sea and the necessary deterioration in other case by long detention the american property so seize and sacrifice at force sale exclude what be adjudge to privateer before or without condemnation bring into the french treasury upward of besides large custom house duty the subject have already be an affair of ' uninterrupted negotiation except for a short time when france be overwhelm by the military power of united europe during this period whilst other nation be extort from payment of claim at the point of the bayonet the|united|states intermit demand for justice out of respect to the oppressed condition of a gallant people to whom feel under obligation for fraternal assistance in own day of suffering and peril the bad effect of these protract and unavaile discussion be obvious and the line of duty be to mind equally so this be either to insist upon the adjustment of claim within a reasonable period or to abandon altogether could not doubt that by this course the interest and honor of both country would be best consult instruction be therefore give in this spirit to the minister who be send out once more to demand reparation upon the meeting of congress in december,|1829 feel duty to speak of these claim and the delay of france in term calculate to call the serious attention of both country to the subject the then french ministry take exception to the message on the ground of conataine a menace under be not agreeable to the|french|government to negotiate the american minister of own accord refute the construction which be attempt to be put upon the message and at the same time call to the recollection of the french ministry that the president 's message be a communication address not to foreign government but to in which be enjoin upon by the constitution to lay before that body information of the state of the union comprehend foreign as well as domestic relation and that if in the discharge of this duty feel indumbent upon to summon the attention of congress in due time to what may be the possible consequence of exist difficulty with any foreign government may fairly be suppose to do so under a sense of own government and not from any intention of hold a menace over a foreign power the view take by receive approbation the|french|government be satisfied and the negotiation be continue terminate in the|treaty|of|july|4 recognize the justice of claim in part and promising payment to the amount of in annual installment the ratification of this treaty be exchange at washington on the|second|of|february,|1832 and in thereafter be lay before congress who immediately pass the act necessary on part to secure to france the commercial advantage concede to in the compact the treaty have previously be solemnly ratify by the|king|of|the french in term which be certainly not mere matter of form and of which the translation be as follow we approve the above convention in all and each of the disposition which be contain in do declare by as well as by heir and successor that be accept approve ratified and confirm and by these present sign by hand do accept approve ratify and confirm promise on the faith and word of a king to observe and to cause to be observe inviolably without ever contravene or suffer to be contravene directly or indirectly for any cause or under any pretense whatsoever official information of the exchange of ratification in the|united|state reach paris whilst the chambers be in session the extraordinary and to injurious delay of the|french|government in action upon the subject of fulfillment have be heretofore state to congress and have no disposition to enlarge upon here be sufficient to observe that the then pende session be allow to expire without even an effort to obtain the necessary appropriation that the succeed one be also suffer to pass away without anything like a serious attempt to obtain a decision upon the subject and that be not until the fourth session almost|three|year after the conclusion of the treaty and more|than|two|year after the exchange of ratification that the bill for the execution of the treaty be press to a vote and reject in the mean time the government of the|united|state have full confidence that a treaty enter into and so solemnly ratify by the|french|ke would be execute in good faith and not doubt that provision would be make for the payment of the first installment which be to become due on the|second|day|of|february,|1833 negotiate a draft for the amount through the|bank|of|the|united|state when this draft be present by the holder with the credential require by the treaty to authorize to receive the money the government|of|france allow to be protest in addition to the injury in the nonpayment of the money by france conformably to engagement the|united|state be expose to a heavy claim on the part of the bank under pretense of damage in satisfaction of which that institution seize upon and still retain an equal amount of the public money congress be in session when the decision of the chambers reach washington and an immediate communication of this apparently final decision of france not to fulfill the stipulation of the treaty be the course naturally to be expect from the president the deep tone of dissatisfaction which pervade the public mind and the correspondent excitement produce in congress by only a general knowledge of the result render more than probable that a resort to immediate measure of redress would be the consequence of call the attention of that body to the subject sincerely desirous of preserve the pacific relation which have so long exist between the country be anxious to avoid this course if could be satisfied that by so neither the interest nor the honor of country would be compromitte without the full assurance on that point could not hope to acquit of the responsibility to be incur in suffer congress to adjourn without lay the subject before those receive by be believe to be of that character that the feeling produce in the|united|state by the news of the rejection of the appropriation would be such as have describe to have be be foresee by the|french|government and prompt measure be take by to prevent the consequence the king in person express through minister at paris profound regret at the decision of the chambers and promise to send forthwith a ship with dispatch to miniter here authorize to give such assurance as would satisfy the government and people of the|united|state that the treaty would yet be faithfully execute by france the national ship arrive and the minister receive instruction claim to act under the authority derive from give to this government in the name of the most solemn assurance that as soon after the new election as the charter would permit the|french|chamber would be convene and the attempt to procure the necessary appropriation renew that all the constitutional power of the king and minister should be put in requisition to accomplish the object and be understand and so expressly inform by this government at the time to engage that the question should be press to a decision at a period sufficiently early to permit information of the result to be communicate to congress at the commencement of next session rely upon these assurance incur the responsibility great as regard to be of suffer congress to separate without communicate with upon the subject the expectation justly found upon the promise thus solemnly make to this government by that of france be not realize the french chambers meet on the|thirty first|of|july,|1834 soon after the election and although minister in paris urge the french ministry to bring the subject before decline do so next insist that the chambers of prorogue without act on the subject should be reassemble at a period so early that action on the treaty may be know in washington prior to the meeting of congress this reasonable request be not only decline but the chambers be prorogue to a day so late that decision however urgently press could not in all probability be obtain in time to reach washington before the necessary adjournment of congress by the constitution the reason give by the ministry for refuse to convoke the chambers at an early period be afterwards shew not to be insuperable by actual convocation on the|first|of|december under a special call for domestic purpose which fact however do not become known to this government until after the commencement of the last session of congress thus disappointed in just expectation become imperative duty to consult with congress in regard to the expediency of a resort to retaliatory measure in case the stipulation of the treaty should not be speedily comply with and to recommend such as in judgment the occasion c alle for to this end an unreserved communication of the case in all aspect become indispensable to have shrink in make from say all that be necessary to correct understanding and that the truth would justify for fear of give offense to other would have be unworthy of to have go on the other hand a single step further for the purpose of wound the pride of a government and people with whom have so many motif for cultivate relation of amity and reciprocal advantage would have be unwise and improper admonish by the past of the difficulty of make even the simple statement of wrong without disturb the sensibility of those who have by position become responsible for redress and earnestly desirous of prevent further obstacle from that source go out of way to preclude a construction of the message by which the recommendation that be make to congress may be regard as a menace to france in not only disavow such a design but in declare that pride and power be too well known to expect anything from fear the message do not reach paris until more|than|a|month after the chambers have be in session and such be the insensibility of the ministry to rightful claim and just expectation that minister have be inform that the matter when introduce would not be press as a cabinet measure although the message be not officially communicate to the|french|government and not withstand the declaration to the contrary which contain the french minstry decide to consider the conditional recommendation of reprisal a menace and an insult which the honor of the nation make incumbent on to resent the measure resort to by to evince sense of the suppose indignity be the immediate recall of minister at washington the offer of passport to the american minister at paris and a public notice to the legislative chambers that all diplomatic intercourse with the|united|state have be suspend have in this manner vindicate the dignity of france next proceed to illustrate justice to this end a bill be immediately introduce into propose to make the appropriation necessary to carry into effect the treaty as this bill subsequently pass into a law the provision of which now constitute the main subject of difficulty between the nation become duty in order to place the subject before in a clear light to trace the history of passage and to refer with some particularity to the proceeding and discussion in regard to the minister of finance in opening speech allude to the measure which have be adopt to resent the suppose indignity and recommend the execution of the treaty as a measure require by the honor and justice of france as the organ of the ministry declare the message so long as have not receive the sanction of congress a mere expression of the personal opinion of the president for which neither the government nor people of the|united|state be responsible and that an engagement have be enter into for the fulfillment of which the honor of france be pledge entertain these view the single condition which the french ministry propose to annex to the payment of the money be that should not be make until be ascertain that the|government|of|the|united|state have do nothing to injure the interest of france or in other word that no step have be authorize by congress of a hostile character toward france what the disposition of action of congress may be be then unknown to the french cabinet but on the|14th|day|of|january the senate resolve that be at that time inexpedient to adopt any legislative measure in regard to the state of affair between the|united|state and france and no action on the subject have occur in the|house|of|representatives these fact be know in paris prior to the|28th|of|march,|1835 when the committee to whom the bill of indemnification have be refer report to the|chamber|of|deputie that committee substantially re - echo the sentiment of the ministry declare that congress have set aside the proposition of the president and recommend the passage of the bill without any other restriction than that originally propose thus be know to the french ministry and chambers that if the position assume by and which have be so frequently and solemnly announce as the only compatible with the honor of france be maintain and the bill pass as originally propose the money would be pay and there would be an end of this unfortunate controversy but this cheer prospect be soon destroy by an amendment introduce into the bill at the moment of passage provide that the money should not be pay until the|french|government have receive satisfactory explanation of the president 's message of the second december,|1834 and what be still more extraordinary the president of the council of minister adopt this amendment and consent to incorporation in the bill in regard to a suppose insult which have be formally resent by the recall of minister and the offer of passport to now for the first time propose to ask explanation sentiment and proposition which have declare could not justly be impute to the government or people of the|united|state be set up as obstacle to the performance of an act of concede justice to that government and people have declare that the honor of france require the fulfillment of the engagement into which the king have enter unless congress adopt the recommendation of the message ascertain that congress do not adopt and yet that fulfillment be refuse unless first obtain from the president explanation of an opinion characterize by as personal and inoperative the conception that be intention to menace or insult the government of france be as unfounded as the attempt to extort from the fear of that nation what sense of justice may deny would be vain and ridiculous but the|united|stat impose on the president the duty of lay before congress the condition of the country in foreign and domestic relation and of recommend such measure as may in opinion be require by interest from the performance of this duty can not be deter by the fear of wound the sensibility of the people or government of whom may become necessary to speak and the american people be incapble of submit to an interference by any government on earth however powerful with the free performance of the domestic duty which the constitution have impose on public functionary the discussion which intervene between the several department of government be to and for anything say in public servant be only responsible to own constituent and to each other if in the course of consultation fact be erroneously state or unjust deduction be make require no other inducement to correct however inform of error than love of justice and what be due to own character but can never submit to be interrogate upon the subject as a matter of right by a foreign power when discussion terminate in act responsibility to foreign power commence not as individual but as a nation the principle which call in question the president for the language of message would equally justify a foreign power in demand explanation of the language use in the report of a committee or by a member in debate this be not the first time that the government|of|france have take exception to the message of american presidents president washington and the first president adams in the performance of duty to the american people fall under the animadversion of the|french|directory the obj ection take by the ministry of charles|10 and remove by the explanation make by minister upon the spot have already be advert to when be understand that the ministry of the present king take exception to message of last|year put a construction upon which be disavow on face late minister at paris in answer to the note which first announce a dissatisfaction with the language use in the message make a communication to the|french|government under date of the|29th|of|january,|1835 calculate to remove all impression which an unreasonable susceptibility have create repeat and call the attention of the|french|government to the disavowal contain in the message of any intention to intimidate by menace truly declare that contain and be intend to contain no charge of ill faith against the|king|of|the french and properly distinguish between the right to complain in unexceptionable term of the omission to execute an agreement and an accusation of bad motif in withhold such execution and demonstrate that the necessary use of that right ought not to be consider as an offensive imputation although this communication be make without instruction and entirely on the minister 's own responsibility yet be afterwards make the act of this government by full approbation and that approbation be officially make known on the|25th|of|april,|1835 to the|french|government however fail to have any effect the law after this friendly explanation pass with the obnoxious amendment support by the king 's minister and be finally approve by the king the people of the|united|state be justly attach to a pacific system in intercourse with foreign nation be proper therefore that should know whether government have adhere to in the present instance have be carry to the utmost extent that be consistent with a become self respect the note of the|29th|of|january to which have before allude be not the only which minister take upon the responsibility of present on the same subject and in the same spirit find that be intend to make the payment of a just debt dependent on the performance of a condition which know could never be comply with think a duty to make another attempt to convince the|french|government that whilst self respect and regard to the dignity of other nation would always prevent from use any language that ought to give offense yet could never admit a right in any foreign government to ask explanation of or to interfere in any manner in the communication which branch of public council make with another that in the present case no such language have be use and that this have in a former note be fully and voluntarily state before be contemplate to make the explantion a condition and that there may be no misapprehension state the term use in that note and officially inform that have be approve by the president and that therefore every explanation which could reasonably be ask or honorably give have be already make that the contemplate measure have be anticipate by a voluntary and friendly declaration and be therefore not only useless but may be deem offensive and certainly would not be comply with if annex as a condition when this latter communication to which especially invite the attention of congress be lay before entertain the hope that the mean be obviously intend to afford of an honorable and speedy adjustment of the difficulty between the nation would have be accept and therefore do not hesitate to give sanction and full approbation this be due to the minister who have make responsible for the act and be publish to the people of the|united|state and be now lay before representative to shew hos far executive have go in endeavor to restore a good understanding betwe en the country would have be at any time communicate to the government|of|france have be officially request the|french|government have receive all the explanation which honor and principle permit and which could in reason be ask be hope would no longer hesitate to pay the installment now due the agent authorize to receive the money be instruct to inform the french minister of readiness to do so in reply to this notice be tell that the money could not then be pay because the formality require by the act of the chambers have not be arrange not have receive any official information of the intention of the|french|government and anxious to bring as far as practicable this unpleasant affair to a close before the meeting of congress that may have the whole subject before cause charge at paris to be instruct to ask for the final determination of the|french|government and in the event of refusal to pay the installment now due without further explanation to return to the|united|state the result of this last application have not yet reach but be daily expect that may be favorable be sincere wish france have now through all the branch of government acknowledge the validity of claim and the obligation of the|treaty|of|1831 and there really exist no adequate cause for further delay will at length may be hope adopt the course which the interest of both nation not less than the principle of justice so imperiously require the treaty be once execute on part little will remain to disturb the friendly relation of the country nothing indeed which will not yield to the suggestion of a pacific and enlighten policy and to the influence of that mutual good will and of those generous recollection which may confidently expect will then be revive in all ancient force in any event however the principle involve in the new aspect which have be give to the controversy be so vitally important to the independent administration of the government that can neither be surrender nor compromitte without national degradation hope be unnecessary for to say that such a sacrifice will not be make through any agency of mine the honor of country shall never be stain by an apology from for the statement of truth and the performance of duty nor can give any explanation of official act except such as be due to integrity and justice and consistent with the principle on which institution have be frame this determination will be confident be approve by constituent have indeed study character to but little purpose if the sum of will have the weight of a feather in the estimation of what appertain to national independence and if unhappily a different impression should at any time obtain in any|quarter will be sure rally round the government of choice with alacrity and unanimity and silence for ever the degrade imputation have thus frankly present to the circumstance which since the last session of congress have occur in this interesting and important matter with the view of the executive in regard to be at this time only necessary to add that when ever the advice now daily expect from chargyy d'affaire shall have be receive will be make the subject of a special communication the condition of the public finance be never more flattering than at the present period since last annual communication all the remain of the public debt have be redeem or money have be place in deposit for this purpose when ever the creditor choose to receive all the other pecuniary engagement of the government have be honorably and promptly fulfil and there will be a balance in the treasury at the close of the|year of about|$19,000,000 be believe that after meet all outstanding and unexpended appropriation there will remain near to be apply to any new object which congress may designate or to the more rapid execution of the work already in progress in aid of these object and to satisfy the current expenditure of the|ensuing|year be estimate that there will be receive from various source more in should congress make new appropriation in conformity with the estimate which will be submit from the proper departments amount to about|$24,000,000 still the available surplus at the close of the|next|year after deduct all unexpended appropriation will probably not be less|than|$6,000,000 this sum can in judgment be now usefully apply to propose improvement in navy yard and to new national work which be not enumerate in the present estimate or to the more rapid completion of those already begin either would be constitutional and useful and would render unnecessary any attempt in present peculiar condition to divide the surplus revenue or to reduce any faster than will be effect by the exist law in any event as the annual report from the secretary of the treasury will enter into detail shew the probability of some decrease in the revenue during the|next|7|years and a very considerable deduction in be not recommend that congress should undertake to modify the present tariff so as to disturb the principle on which the compromise act be pass taxation on some of the article of general consumption which be not in competition with own production may be no doubt so diminished as to lessen to some extent the source of this revenue and the same object can also be assist by more liberal provision for the subject of public defense which in the present state of prosperity and wealth may be expect to engage attention if however after satisfy all the demand which can arise from these source the unexpended balance in the treasury should still continue to increase would be well to bear with the evil until the great change contemplate in tariff law have occur and shall enable to revise the system with that care and circumspection which be due to so delicate and important a subject be certainly duty to diminish as far as can the burden of taxation and to regard all the restriction which be impose on the trade and navigation of citizen as evil which shall mitigate when ever be not prevent by the adverse legislation and policy of foreign nation or those primary duty which the defense and independence of country enjoin upon that have accomplish much toward the relief of citizen by the change which have accompany the payment of the public debt and the adoption of the present revenue law be manifest from the fact that compare to there be a diminution of near in the|last|two|year and that expenditure independently of those for the public debt have be reduce near during the same period let trust that by the continue observance of economy and by harmonize the great interest of agriculture manufacture and commerce much more may be accomplish to diminish the burden of government and to increase still further the enterprise and the patriotic affection of all class of citizen and all the member of happy confederacy as the datum which the secretary of the treasury will lay before in regard to financial resource be full and extended and will afford a safe guide in future calculation think unnecessary to offer any further observation on that subject here among the evidence of the increase prosperity of the country not the least gratifying be that afford by the receipt from the sale of the public land which amount in the|present|year to the unexpected sum of this circumstance attest the rapidity with which agriculture the first and most important occupation of man advance and contribute to the wealth and power of extended territory be still of the opinion that be good policy as far as can consistently with the obligation under which those land be cede to the|united|state to promote speedy settlement beg leave to call the attention of the present congress to the suggestion have offer respect in former message the extraordinary receipt from the sale of the public land invite to consider what improvement the land system and particularly the condition of the|general|land|office may require at the time this institution be organize near a|quarter|century|ago would probably have be think extravagant to anticipate for this period such an addition to business as have be produce by the vast increase of those sale during the|past|and|present|years may also be observe that since the|year|1812 the land office and surveying district have be greatly multiply and that numerous legislative enactment from year to year since that time have impose a great amount of new and additional duty upon that office while the want of a timely application of force commensurate with the care and labor require have cause the increase embarrassment of accumulate arrear in the different branch of the establishment these impediment to the expedition of much duty in the|general|land|office induce to submit to judgment whether some modification of the law relate to organization or an organization of a new character be not call for at the present juncture to enable the office to accomplish all the end of institution with a great degree of facility and promptitude than experience have prove to be practicable under exist regulation the variety of the concern and the magnitude and complexity of the detail occupy and divide the attention of the commissioner appear to render difficult if not impracticable for that officer by any possible assiduity to bestow on all the multifarious subject upon which be call to act the ready and careful attention due to respective importance unless the legislature shall assist by a law providing or enable to provide for a more regular and economical distribution of labor with the incident responsibility among those employ under direction the mere manual operation of affix signature to the vast number of document issue from office subtract so largely from the time and attention claim by the weighty and complicated subject daily accumulate in that branch of the public service as to indicate the strong necessity of revise the organic law of the establishment will be easy for congress hereafter to proportion the expenditure on account of this branch of the service to real want by abolish from time to time the office which can be dispense with the extinction of the public debt have take place there be no longer any use for the office of commissioners|of|loan and of the|sinking|fund recommend therefore that be abolish and that proper measure be take for the transfer to the|treasury|department of any fund book and paper connect with the operation of those office and that the proper power be give to that department for close finally any portion of business which may remain to be settle be also incumbent on congress in guard the pecuniary interest of the country to discontinue by such a law as be pass in the receipt of the bill of the|bank|of|the|united|state in payment of the public revenue and to provide for the designation of an agent whose duty shall be to take charge of the book and stock of the|united|state in that institution and to close all connection with after the of march when charter expire in make provision in regard to the disposition of this stock will be essential to define clearly and strictly the duty and power of the officer charge with that branch of the public service will be see from the correspondence which the secretary of the treasury will lay before that not withstand the large amount of the stock which the united|states hold in that institution no information have yet be communicate which will enable the government to anticipate when can receive any dividend or derive any benefit from connect with the condition of the finance and the flourish state of the country in all branch of industry be pleasing to witness the advantage which have be already derive from the recent law regulate the value of the gold coinage these advantage will be more apparent in the course of the|next|year when the branch mint authorize to be establish in north|carolina georgia and louisiana shall have go into operation aid as be hope will be by further reform in the banking system of the states and by judicious regulation on the part of congress in relation to the custody of the public money may be confidently anticipate that the use of gold and silver as circulate medium will become general in the ordinary transaction connect with the labor of the country the great desideratum in modern time be an efficient check upon the power of bank prevent that excessive issue of paper whence arise those fluctuation in the standard of value which render uncertain the reward of labor be suppose by those who establish the|bank|of|the|united|state that from the credit give to by the custody of the public money and other privilege and the precaution take to guard against the evil which the country have suffer in the bankruptcy of many of the state institution of that period should derive from that institution all the security and benefit of a sound currency and every good end that be attainable under the provision of the constitution which authorize congress alone to coin money and regulate the value thereof but be scarcely necessary now to say that these anticipation have not be realize after the extensive embarrassment and distress recently produce by the|bank|of|the|united|states from which the country be now recover aggravate as be by pretension to power which defy the public authority and which if acquiesce in by the people would have change the whole character of government every candid and intelligent individual must admit that for the attainment of the great advantage of a sound currency must look to a course of legislation radically different from that which create such an institution in consider the mean of obtain so important an end must set aside all calculation of temporary convenience and be influence by those only which be in harmony with the true character and the permanent interest of the republic must recur to first principle and see what be that have prevent the legislation of congress and the states on the subject of currency from satisfy the public expectation and realize result correspond to those which have attend the action of system when truly consistent with the great principle of equality upon which rest and with that spirit of forbearance and mutual concession and generous patriotism which be originally and must ever continue to be the vital element of union on this subject be sure that can not be mistake in ascribe want of success to the undue countenance which have be afford to the spirit of monopoly all the serious danger which system have yet encounter may be trace to the resort to imply power and the use of corporation clothe with privilege the effect of which be to advance the interest of the few at the expense of the many have feel but class of these danger exhibit in the contest wag by the|bank|of|the|united|state against the government for happily have be obviate for the present by the indignant resistance of the people but should recollect that the principle whence spring be an ever active which will not fail to renew effo rt in the same and in other form so long as there be a hope of success found either on the inattention of the people or the treachery of representative to the subtle progress of influence the bank be in fact but of the fruit of a system at war with the genius of all institution a system found upon a political creed the fundamental principle of which be a distrust of the popular will as a safe regulator of political power and whose great ultimate object and inevitable result should prevail be the consolidation of all power in system in central government lavish public disbursement and corporation with exclusive privilege would be substitute for the original and as yet sound check and balance of the constitution the mean by whose silent and secret operation a control would be exercise by the few over the political conduct of the many by first acquire that control over the labor and earning of the great body of the people wherever this spirit have effect an alliance with political power tyranny and despotism have be the fruit if be ever use for the end of government have to be incessantly watch or corrupt the source of the public virtue and agitate the country with question unfavorable to the harmonious and steady pursuit of true interest be now to see whether in the present favorable condition of the country can not take an effectual stand against thei spirit of monopoly and practically prove in respect to the currency as well as other important interest that ther be no necessity for so extensive a resort to as that which have be heretofore practice the experience of another|year have confirm the utter fallacy of the idea that the|bank|of|the|united|states be necessary as a fiscal agent of the government without aid as such indeed in despite of all the embarrassment be in power to create the revenue have be pay with punctuality by citizen the business of exchange both foreign and domestic have be conduct with convenience and the circulate medium have be greatly improve by the use of the state bank which do not derive charter from the|general|government and be not control by authority be ascertain that the money of the|united|state can be collect and disburse without loss or inconvenience and that all the want of the community in relation to exchange and currency be supply as well as have ever be before if under circumstance the most unfavorable to the steadiness of the money market have be find that the consideration on which the|bank|of|the|united|state rest claim to the public favor be imaginary and groundless can not be doubt that the experience of the future will be more decisive against have be see that without the agency of a great moneyed monopoly the revenue can be collect and conveniently and safely apply to all the purpose of the public expenditure be also ascertain that instead of be necessarily make to promote the evil of an unchecked paper system the management of the revenue can be make auxiliary to the reform which the legislature of several of the states have already commence in regard to the suppression of small bill and which have only to be foster by proper regulation on the part of congress to secure a practical return to the extent require for the security of the currency to the constitutional medium sever from the government as political engine and not susceptible of dangerous extension and combination the state bank will not be tempt nor will have teh power which have see exercise to divert the public fund from the legitimate purpose of the government the collection and custody of the revenue be on the contrary a source of credit to will increase the security which the states provide for a faithful execution of trust by multiply the scrutiny to which operation and account will be subject thus dispose as well from interest as the obligation of charter can not be doubt that such condition as congress may see fit to adopt respect the deposit in these institution with a view to the gradual disuse of the small bill will be cheerfully comply with and that shall soon gain in place of the|bank|of|the|united|state a practical reform in the whole paper system of the country if by this policy can ultimately witness the suppression of all bank bill below|$20 be apparent that gold and silver will take place and become the principal circulate medium in the common business of the farmer and mechanic of the country the attainment of such a result will form an era in the history of country which will be dwell upon with delight by every true friend of liberty and independence will lighten the great tax which paper system have so long collect from the earning of labor and do more to revive and perpetuate those habit of economy and simplicity which be so congenial to the character of republican than all the legislation which have yet be attempt to this subject feel that can not too earnestly invite the special attention of congress without the exercise of whose authority the opportunity to accomplish so much public good must pass unimproved deeply impressed with vital importance the executive have take all the step within constitutional power to guard the public revenue and defeat the expectation which the|bank|of|the|united|state indulge of renew and perpetuate monopoly on the ground of necessity as a fiscal agent and as afford a sounder currency than could be obtain without such an institution in the performance of this duty much responsibility be incur which would have be gladly avoid if the stake which the public have in the question could have be otherwise preserve although clothe with the legal authority and support by precedent be aware that there be in the act of the removal of the deposit a liability to excite that sensitiveness to executive power which be characteristic and the duty of free man to indulge but rely on this feeling also direct by patriotism and intelligence to vindicate the conduct which in the end would appear to have be call for by the interest of country the apprehension natural to this feeling that there may have be a desire through the instrumentality of that measure to extend the executive influence or that may have be prompt by motif not sufficiently free from ambition be not over look under the operation of institution the public servant who be call on to take a step of high responsibility should feel in the freedom which give rise to such apprehension high security when unfounded the attention which arouse and the discussion excite deprive those who indulge of the power to do harm when just but hasten the certainty with which the great body of citizen never fail to repel an attempt to procure the sanction to any exercise of power inconsistent with the jealous maintenance of right under such conviction and entertain no doubt that constitutional obligation demand the step which be take inreference to the removal of the deposit be impossible for to be deter from the path of duty by a fear that motif could be misjudge or that political prejudice could defeat the just consideration of the merit of conduct the result have shew how safe be this reliance upon the patriotic temper and enlighten discernment of the people that measure have now be before and have stand the test of all the severe analysis which general importance the interest affect and the apprehension excited be calculate to produce and now remain for congress to consider what legislation have become necessary in consequence need only add to what have on former occasion say on this subject general that in the regulation which congress may prescribe respect the custody of the public money be desirable that as little discretion as may be deem consistent with safe keeping should be give to the executive agent no one can be more deeply impressed than be with the soundness of the doctrine which restrain and limit by specific provision executive discretion as far as can be do consistently with the preservation of constitutional character in respect to the control over the public money this doctrine be peculiarly applicable and be in harmony with the great principle which feel be sustain in the controversy with the|bank|of|the|united|states which have result in sever to some extent a dangerous connection between a moneyed and political power the duty of the legislature to define by clear and positive enactment the nature and extent of the action which belong to the executive to superintend spring out of a policy analogous to that which enjoin upon all branch of the|federal|government an abstinence from the exercise of power not clearly grant in such a government possess only limited and specific power the spirit of general administration can not be wise or just when oppose the reference of all doubtful point to the great source of authority the states and the people whose number and diversify relation secure against the influence and excitement which may mis lead agent make the safe depository of power in application to the executive with reference to the legislative branch of the government the same rule of action should make the president ever anxious to avoid the exercise of any discretionary authority which can be regulate by congress the bias which may operate upon will not be so likely to extend to the representative of the people in that body in former message to congress have repeatedly urge the propriety of lessen the discretionary authority lodge in the various departments but have produce no effect as yet except the discontinuance of extra allowance in the army and navy and the substitution of fix salary in the latter be believe that the same principle could be advantageously apply in all case and would promote the efficiency and economy of the public service at the same tiem that great satisfaction and more equal justice would be secure to the public officer generally the accompanying report of the secretary of war will put in possession of the operation of the department confide to care in all diversified relation during the|past|year be gratify in be able to inform that no occurrence have require any movement of the military force except such as be common to a state of peace the service of the army have be limit to usual duty at the various garrison upon the atlantic and in land frontier with the exception state by the secretary of

that country to the|united|state and the large claim of citizen upon the government arise before and since the division of colombia render in judgment improper longer to delay this step representative to central|america peru and brazil be either at or on way to respective post from the|argentine|republic from which a minister be expect to this government nothing further have be hear occasion have be take on the departure of a new consul to buenos|ayres to remind that government that long delay minister whose appointment have be make known to have not arrive become unpleasant duty to inform that this pacific and highly gratify picture of foreign relation do not include those with france at this time be not possible that any government and people could be more sincerely desirous of conciliate a just and friendly intercourse with another nation than be those of the|united|state with ancient ally and friend this disposition be found as well on the most grateful and honorable recollection associate with struggle for independence as upon a well ground conviction that be consonant with the true policy of both the people of the|united|state could not therefore see without the deep regret even a temporary interruption of the friendly relation between the country a regret which would be sure be greatly aggravate if there should turn out to be any reasonable ground for attribute such a result to any act of omission or commission on part derive therefore the high satisfaction from be able to assure that the whole course of this government have be characterize by a spirit so conciliatory and for bearing as to make impossible that justice and moderation should be question what ever may be the consequence of a long perseverance on the part of the|french|government in omission to satisfy the concede claim of citizen the history of the accumulate and unprovoked aggression upon commerce commit by authority of the exist government of france between|the|years|1800|and|1817 have be render too painfully familiar to americans to make repetition either necessary or desirable will be sufficient here to remark that there have for many|year be scarcely a single administration of the|french|government by whom the justice and legality of the claim of citizen to indemnity be not to a very considerable extent admit and yet near a|quarter|of|a|century have be waste in ineffectual negotiation to secure deeply sensible of the injurious effect result from this state of thing upon the interest and character of both nation regard as among first duty to cause more effort to be make to satisfy france that a just and liberal settlement of claim be as well due to own honor as to incontestable validity the negotiation for this purpose be commence with the late government of france and be prosecute with such success as to leave no reasonable ground to doubt that a settlement of a character quite as liberal as that which be subsequently make would have be effect have not the revolution by which the negotiation be cut off take place the discussion be resume with the present government and the result show that be not wrong in suppose that an event by which the government be make to approach each other so much nearer in political principle and by which the motif for the most liberal and friendly intercourse be so greatly multiply could exercise no other than a salutary influence upon the negotiation after the most deliberate and thorough examination of the whole subject a treaty between the government be conclude and sign at paris on by which be stipulate that the|french|government in order to liberate from all the reclamation prefer against by citizen of the|united|state for unlawful seizure capture sequestration confiscation or destruction of vessel cargo or other property engage to pay a sum of to the|united|state who shall distribute among those entitle in the manner and accord to the rule shall determine

faith of the french nation have be thus solemnly pledge through constitutional organ for the liquidation and ultimate payment of the long defer claim of citizen as also for the adjustment of other point of great and reciprocal benefit to both country and the|united|state have with a fidelity and promptitude by which conduct will trust be always characterize do every thing that be necessary to carry the treaty into full and fair effect on part count with the most perfect confidence on equal fidelity and promptitude on the part of the|french|government in this reasonable expectation have be regret to inform wholly disappointed no legislative provision have be make by france for the execution of the treaty either as respect the indemnity to be pay or the commercial benefit to be secure to the|united|state and the relation between the|united|state and that power in consequence thereof be place in a situation threaten to interrupt the good understanding which have so long and so happily exist between the nation not only have the|french|government be thus want in the performance of the stipulation have so solemnly enter into with the|united|state but omission have be mark by circumstance which would seem to leave without satisfactory evidence that such performance will certainly take place at a future period advice of the exchange of ratification reach paris prior to the|french|chamber be then sit and continue in session until and although installment of the indemnity be payable on one|year after the exchange of ratification no application be make to the chambers for the require appropriation and in consequence of no appropriation have then be make the draft of the|united|states|government for that installment be dishonor by the minister of finance and the|united|stat thereby involve in much controversy the next session of the chambers commence on and continue until not withstand the omission to pay the first installment have be make the subject of earnest remonstrance on part the treaty with the|united|state and a bill make the necessary appropriation to execute be not lay before the|chamber|of|deputie until nearly|five|months after meeting and only|nineteen|days before the close of the session the bill be read and refer to a committee but there be no further action upon the next session of the chambers commence on and continue until a new bill be introduce on but nothing important be do in relation to during the session in nearly|three|years after the signature of the treaty the final action of the french chambers upon the bill to carry the treaty into effect be obtain and result in a refusal of the necessary appropriation the avow ground upon which the bill be reject be to be find in the publish debate of that body and no observation of mine can be necessary to satisfy congress of utter insufficiency although the gross amount of the claim of citizen be probably great than will be ultimately allow by the commissioner sufficient be never the less show to render absolutely certain that the indemnity fall far short of the actual amount of just claim independently of the question of damage and interest for the detention that the settlement involve a sacrifice in this respect be well know at the time a sacrifice which be cheerfully acquiesce in by the different branch of the|federal|government whose action upon the treaty be require from a sincere desire to avoid further collision upon this old and disturbing subject and in the confident expectation that the general relation between the country would be improve thereby the refusal to vote the appropriation the news of which be receive from minister in paris about may have be consider the final determination of the|french|government not to execute the stipulation of the treaty and would have justify an immediate communication of the fact to congress with a recommendation of such ultimate measure as the interest and honor of the|united|state may seem to require but with the news of the refusal of the chambers to make the appropriation be convey the regret of the king and a declaration that a national vessel should be forthwith send out with instruction to the french minister to give the most ample explanation of the past and the strong assurance for the future after a long passage the promise dispatch vessel arrive the pledge give by the french minister upon receipt of instruction be that as soon after the election of the new member as the charter would permit the legislative chambers|of|france should be call together and the proposition for an appropriation lay before that all the constitutional power of the king and cabinet should be exert to accomplish the object and that the result should be make known early enough to be communicate to congress at the commencement of the present session rely upon these pledge and not doubt that the acknowledge justice of claim the promise exertion of the king and cabinet and above all that sacred regard for the national faith and honor for which the french character have be so distinguished would secure an early execution of the treaty in all part do not deem necessary to call the attention of congress to the subject at the last session regret to say that the pledge make through the minister of france have not be redeem the new chambers meet on and although the subject of fulfil treaty be allude to in the speech from the throne no attempt be make by the king or cabinet to procure an appropriation to carry into execution the reason give for this omission although may be consider sufficient in an ordinary case be not consistent with the expectation found upon the assurance give here for there be no constitutional obstacle to enter into legislative business at the first meeting of the chambers this point however may have be over look have not the chambers instead of be call to meet at so|early|a|day that the result of deliberation may be communicate to before the meeting of congress be prorogue to a period so late that decision can scarcely be make known to the present congress prior to dissolution to avoid this delay minister in paris in virtue of the assurance give by the french minister in the|united|state strongly urge the convocation of the chambers at an early day but without success be proper to remark however that this refusal have be accompany with the most positive assurance on the part of the executive government of france of intention to press the appropriation at the ensue session of the chambers the executive branch of this government have as matter stand exhaust all the authority upon the subject with which be invest and which have any reason to believe could be beneficially employ the idea of acquiesce in the refusal to execute the treaty will not be confident be for a moment entertain by any branch of this government and further negotiation upon the subject be equally out of the question if shall be the pleasure of congress to await the further action of the|french|chamber no further consideration of the subject will at this session probably be require at hand but if from the original delay in ask for an appropriation from the refusal of the chambers to grant when ask from the omission to bring the subject before the chambers at last session from the fact that include that session there have be different occasion when the appropriation may have be make and from the delay in convoke the chambers until some|week after the meeting of congress when be well know that a communication of the whole subject to congress at the last session be prevent by assurance that should be dispose of before present meeting should feel yourself constrain to doubt whether be the intention of the|french|government in all branch to carry the treaty into effect and think that such measure as the occasion may be deem to call for should be now adopt the important question arise what those measure shall be institution be essentially pacific peace and friendly intercourse with all nation be as much the desire of government as be the interest of people but these object be not to be permanently secure by surrender the right of citizen or permit solemn treaty for indemnity in case of flagrant wrong to be abrogate or set aside be undoubtedly in the power of congress seriously to affect the agricultural and manufacture interest of france by the passage of law relate to trade with the|united|state product manufacture and tonnage may be subject to heavy duty in port or all commercial intercourse with may be suspend but there be powerful and to mind conclusive objection to this mode of proceed can not embarrass or cut off the trade of france without at the same time in some degree embarrassing or cut off own trade the injury of such a warfare must fall though unequally upon own citizen and could not but impair the mean of the government and weaken that united sentiment in support of the right and honor of the nation which must now pervade every bosom nor be impossible that such a course of legislation would introduce once more into national council those disturb question in relation to the tariff of duty which have be so recently put to rest besides by every measure adopt by the|government|of|the|united|sstate with the view of injure france the clear perception of right which will induce own people and the ruler and people of all other nation even of france to pronounce quarrel just will be obscure and the support render to in a final resort to more decisive measure will be more limited and equivocal there be but point of controversy and upon that the whole civilized world must pronounce france to be in the wrong insist that shall pay a sum of money which have acknowledge to be due and of the justice of this demand there can be but opinion among mankind true policy would seem to dictate that the question at issue should be keep thus disencumber and that not the slight pretense should be give to france to persist in refusal to make payment by any act on part affect the interest of people the question should be leave as be now in such an attitude that when france fulfill treaty stipulation all controversy will be at an end be conviction that the|united|states ought to insist on a prompt execution of the treaty and in case be refuse or longer delay take redress into own hand after the delay on the part of france of a quarter of a century in acknowledge these claim by treaty be not to be tolerate that another|quarter|of|a|century be to be waste in negotiate about the payment the law of nation provide a remedy for such occasion be a well settle principle of the international code that where nation owe another a liquidated debt which refuse or neglect to pay the aggrieved party may seize on the property belong to the other citizen or subject sufficient to pay the debt without give just cause of war this remedy have be repeatedly resort to and recently by france toward portugal under circumstance less unquestionable the time at which resort should be have to this or any other mode of redress be a point to be decide by congress if an appropriation shall not be make by the|french|chamber at next session may justly be conclude that the government of france have finally determine to disregard own solemn undertaking and refuse to pay an acknowledge debt in that event every day 's delay on part will be a stain upon national honor as well as a denial of justice to injure citizen prompt measure when the refusal of france shall be complete will not only be most honorable and just but will have the good effect upon national character since france in violation of the pledge give through minister here have delay final action so long that decision will not probably be know in time to be communicate to this congress recommend that a law be pass authorize reprisal upon french property in case provision shall not be make for the payment of the debt at the approach session of the french chambers pride and power be too well known to expect any thing from fear and preclude the necessity of a declaration that nothing partake of the character of intimidation be intend by ought to look upon as the evidence only of an inflexible determination on the part of the|united|state to insist on right that government by do only what have acknowledge to be just will be able to spare the|united|state the necessity of take redress into own hand and save the property of french citizen from that seizure and sequestration which american citizen so long endure without retaliation or redress if should continue to refuse that act of acknowledge justice and in violation of the law of nation make reprisal on part the occasion of hostility against the|united|state would but add violence to injustice and could not fail to expose to the just censure of civilized nation and to the retributive judgment of heaven collision with france be the more to be regret on account of the position occupy in europe in relation to liberal institution but in maintain national right and honor all government be alike to if by a collision with france in a case where be clearly in the wrong the march of liberal principle shall be impede the responsibility for that result as well as every other will rest on own head have submit these consideration belong to congress to decide whether after what have take place will still await the further action of the|french|chamber or now adopt such provisional measure as may deem necessary and best adapt to protect the right and maintain the honor of the country what ever that decision may be will be faithfully enforce by the executive as far as be authorize so to do accord to the estimate of the|treasury|department the revenue accrue from all source during the|present|year will amount to which with the balance remain in the treasury on of produce an aggregate of the total expenditure during the|year for all object include the public debt be estimate at which will leave a balance in the treasury on of in this balance however will be include about|$1,150,000 of what be heretofore report by the department as not effective of former appropriation be estimate that there will remain unexpended at the close of the year and that of this sum there will not be require more|than|$5,141,964 to accomplish the object of all the current appropriation thus appear that after satisfy all those appropriation and after discharge the last item of public debt which will be do on there will remain unexpended in the treasury an effective balance of that such should be the aspect of finance be highly flatter to the industry and enterprise of population and auspicious of the wealth and prosperity which await the future cultivation of grow resource be not deem prudent however to recommend any change for the present in impost rate the effect of the gradual reduction now in progress in many of not be sufficiently test to guide in determine the precise amount of revenue which will produce free from public debt at peace with all the world and with no complicated interest to consult in intercourse with foreign power the present may be hail as the epoch in history the most favorable for the settlement of those principle in domestic policy which shall be best calculate to give stability to republic and secure the blessing of freedom to citizen among these principle from past experience can not be doubt that simplicity in the character of the|federal|government and a rigid economy in administration should be regard as fundamental and sacred all must be sensible that the existence of the public debt by render taxation necessary for extinguishment have increase the difficulty which be inseparable from every exercise of the tax power and that be in this respect a remote agent in produce those disturbing question which grow out of the discussion relate to the tariff if such have be the tendency of a debt incur in the acquisition and maintenance of national right and liberty the obligation of which all portion of the union cheerfully acknowledge must be obvious that what ever be calculate to increase the burden of government without necessity must be fatal to all hope of preserve true character while be felicitate therefore upon the extinguishment of the national debt and the prosperous state of finance let not be tempt to depart from those sound maxim of public policy which enjoin a just adaptation of the revenue to the expenditure that be consistent with a rigid economy and an entire abstinence from all topic of legislation that be not clearly within the constitutional power of the government and suggest by the want of the country properly regard under such a policy every diminution of the public burden arise from taxation give to individual enterprise increase power and furnishe to all the member of happy confederacy new motif for patriotic affection and support but above all most important effect will be find in influence upon the character of the government by confine action to those object which will be sure to secure to the attachment and support of fellow citizen circumstance make duty to call the attention of congress to the|bank|of|the|united|state create for the convenience of the government that institution have become the scourge of the people interference to postpone the payment of a portion of the national debt that may retain the public money appropriate for that purpose to strengthen in a political contest the extraordinary extension and contraction of accommodation to the community corrupt and partisan loan exclusion of the public director from a knowledge of most important proceeding the unlimited authority confer on the president to expend fund in hire writer and procure the execution of printing and the use make of that authority the retention of the pension money and book after the selection of new agent the groundless claim to heavy damage in consequence of the protest of the bill draw on the|french|government have through various channel be lay before congress immediately after the close of the last session the bank through president announce ability and readiness to abandon the system of unparalleled curtailment and the interruption of domestic exchange which have practice upon from 01|to|1834 and to extend accommodation to the community the ground assume in this annunciation amount to an acknowledgment that the curtailment in the extent to which have be carry be not necessary to the safety of the bank and have be persist in merely to induce congress to grant the prayer of the bank in memorial relative to the removal of the deposit and to give a new charter be substantially a confession that all the real distress which individual and the country have endure for the precede have be needlessly produce by with the view of affect through the suffering of the people the legislative action of congress be subject of congratulation that congress and the country have the virtue and firmness to bear the infliction that the energy of people soon find relief from this wanton tyranny in vast importation of th eprecious metal from almost every part of the world and that at the close of this tremendous effort to control government the bank find powerless and no longer able to loan out surplus mean the community have learn to manage affair without assistance and trade have already find new auxiliary so that on the extraordinary spectacle be present of a national more|than|half of whose capital be either lie unproductive in vault or in the hand of foreign banker to the needless distress bring on the country during the last session of congress have since be add the open seizure of the dividend on the public stock to the amount of under pretense of pay damage cost and interest upon the protest french bill this sum constitute a portion of the estimate revenue for the|year|1834 upon which the appropriation make by congress be base would as soon have be expect that collector would seize on the custom or the receiver of land office on the money arise from the sale of public land under pretense of claim against the|united|state as that the bank would have retain the dividend indeed if the principle be establish that any one who choose to set up a claim against the|united|state may without authority of law seize on the public property or money wherever can find to pay such claim there will remain no assurance that revenue will reach the treasury or that will be apply after the appropriation to the purpose designate in the law the pay master of army and the purser of navy may under like pretense apply to own use money appropriate to set in motion the public force and in time of war leave the country without defense this measure resort to by the bank be disorganize and revolutionary and if generally resort to by private citizen in like case would fill the land with anarchy and violence be a constitutional provision that no money shall be draw from the treasury but in consequence of appropriation make by law the palpable object of this provision be to prevent the expenditure of the public money for any purpose what so ever which shall not have be 1st approve by the representative of the people and the states in congress assemble vest the power of declare for what purpose the public money shall be expend in the legislative department of the government to the exclusion of the executive and judicial and be not within the constitutional authority of either of those department to pay away without law or to sanction payment accord to this plain constitutional provision the claim of the bank can never be pay without an appropriation by act of congress but the bank have never ask for an appropriation attempt to defeat the provision of the constitution and obtain payment without an act of congress instead of await an appropriation pass by both houses and approve by the president make an appropriation for and invite an appeal to the judiciary to sanction that the money have not technically be pay into the treasury do not affect the principle intend to be establish by the constitution the executive and the judiciary have as little right to appropriate and expend the public money without authority of law before be place to the credit of the treasury as to take from the treasury in the annual report of the secretary of the treasury and in correspondence with the president of the bank and the opinion of the attorney general accompany will find a further examination of the claim of the bank and the course have pursue seem due to the safety of the people fund remain in that bank and to the honor of the american people that measure be take to separate the government entirely from an institution so mischievous to the public prosperity and so regardless of the constitution and law by transfer the public deposit by appoint other pension agent as far as have the power by order the discontinuance of the receipt of bank check in the payment of the public due after the executive have exert all lawful authority to sever the connection between the government and this faithless corporation the high handed career of this institution impose upon the constitutional functionary of this government duty of the grave and most imperative character duty which can not avoid and from which trust there will be no inclination on the part of any of to shrink own sense of be most clear as be also readiness to discharge those which may rightfully fall on to continue any business relation with the|bank|of|the|united|state that may be avoid without a violation of the national faith after that institution have set at open defiance the concede right of the government to examine affair after have do all in power to deride the public authority in other respect and to bring into disrepute at home and abroad after have attempt to defeat the clearly express will of the people by turn against the immense power intrust to hand and by involve a country otherwise peaceful flourish and happy in dissension embarrassment and distress would make the nation a party to the degradation so sedulously prepare for itss public agent and do much to destroy the confidence of man kind in popular government and to bring into contempt authority and efficiency in guard against an evil of such magnitude consideration of temprary convenience should be throw out of the question and should be influence by such motif only as look to the honor and preservation of the republican system deeply and solemnly impress with the justice of these view feel to be duty to recommend to that a law be pass authorize the sale of the public stock that the provision of the charter require the receipt of note of the bank in payment of public due shall in accordance with the power reserve to congress in the 14th section of the charter be suspend until the bank pay to the treasury the dividend withhold and that all law connect the government or officer with the bank directly or indirectly be repeal and that the institution be leave hereafter to own resource and mean event have satisfy mind and think the mind of the american people that the mischief and danger which flow from a national bank far over balance all advantage the bold effort the present bank have make to control the government the distress have wantonly produce the violence of which have be the occasion in of city fame for observance of law and order be but premonition of the fate which await the american people should be delude into a perpetuation of this institution or the establishment of another like be fervently hope that thus admonish those who have heretofore favor the establishment of a substitute for the present bank will be induce to abandon as be evidently well to incur any inconvenience that may be reasonably expect than to concentrate the whole moneyed power of the republic in any form what so ever or under any restriction happily be already illustrate that the agency of such an institution be not necessary to the fiscal operation of the government the state bank be find fully adequate to the performance of all service which be require of the|bank|of|the|united|state quite as promptly and with the same cheapness have maintain and discharge all these duty while the|bank|of|the|united|state be still powerful and in the field as an open enemy and be not possible to conceive that will find great difficulty in operation when that enemy shall cease to exist the attention of congress be earnestly invite to the regulation of the deposit in the state bank by law although the power now exercise by the executive department in this behalf be only such as be uniformly exert through every administration from the origin of the government up to the establishment of the present bank yet be which be susceptible of regulation by law and therefore ought so to be regulate the power of congress to direct in what place the treasurer shall keep the money in the treasury and to impose restriction upon the executive authority in relation to custody and removal be unlimited and exercise will rather be court than discourage by those public officer and agent on whom rest the responsibility for safety be desirable that as little power as possible should be leave to the president or the secretary of the treasury over those institution which be thus free from executive influence and without a common head to direct operation would have neither the temptation nor the ability to interfere in the political conflict of the country not derive charter from the national authority would never have those inducement to meddle in general election which have lead the|bank|of|the|united|state to agitate and convulse the country for upward of two|year the progress of gold coinage be creditable to the officer of the mint and promise in a short period to furnish the country with a sound and portable currency which will much diminish the inconvenience to traveler of the want of a general paper currency should the state bank be incapable of furnish those institution have already show competent to purchase and furnish domestic exchange for the convenience of trade at reasonable rate and not a doubt be entertain that in a short period all the want of the country in bank accommodation and exchange will be supplid as promptly and as cheaply as have heretofore be by the|bank|of|the|united|state if the several state shall be induce gradually to reform banking system and prohibit the issue of all small note shall in a|few|year have a currency as sound and as little liable to fluctuation as any other commercial country the report of the secretary of war together with the accompany document from the several bureaux of that department will exhibit the situation of the various object commit to administration no event have occur since last session render necessary any movement of the army with the exception of the expedition of the regiment of dragoon into the territory of the wandering and predatory tribe inhabit the western frontier and live adjacent to the mexican boundary these tribe have be heretofore know to principally by attack upon own citizen and upon other indians entitle to the protection of the|united|state become necessary for the peace of the frontier to check these habitual inroad and be happy to inform that the object have be effect without the commission of any act of hostility colonel dodge and the troop under command have act with equal firmness and humanity and an arrangement have be make with those indians which be hope will assure permanent pacific relation with the|united|state and the other tribe of indians upon that border be to be regret that the prevalence of sickness in that|quarter have deprive the country of a number of valuable life and particularly that general leavenworth an officer well know and esteem for gallant service in the late war and for subsequent good conduct have fall a victim to zeal and exertion in the discharge of duty the army be in a high state of discipline moral condition so far as that be know here be good and the various branch of the public service be carefully attend to be amply sufficient under present organization for provide the necessary garrison for the seaboard and for the defense of the internal frontier and also for preserve the element of military knowledge and for keep pace with those improvement which modern experience be continually make and these object appear to to embrace all the legitimate purpose for which a permanent military force should be maintain in country the lesson of history teach danger and the tendency which exist to an increase this can be best meet and avert by a just caution on the part of the public and of those who represent in congress from the duty which devolve on teh|engineer|department and upon the topographical engineer a different organization seem to be demand by the public interest and recommend the subject to consideration no important change have during this|season take place in the condition of the indians arrangement be in progress for the removal of the creeks and will soon be for the removal of the seminoles regret that the cherokees east of the mississippi have not yet determine as a community to remove how long the personal cause which have heretofore retard that ultimately inevitable measure will continue to operate be unable to conjecture be certain however that delay will bring with accumulate evil which will render condition more and more unpleasant the experience of every|year add to the conviction that emigration and that alone can preserve from destruction the remnant of the tribe yet live amongst the facility with which the necessary of life be procure and the treaty stipulation provide aid for the emigrant indians in agricultural pursuit and in the important concern of education and removal from those cause which have heretofore depressed all and destroy many of the tribe can not fail to stimulate exertion and to reward industry the law pass at the last session of congress on the subject of indian affair have be carry into effect and detailed instruction for administration have be give will be see by the estimate for the present session that a great reduction will take place in the expenditure of the department in consequence of these law and there be reason to believe that operation will be salutary and that the colonization of the indians on the western frontier together with a judicious system of administration will still further reduce the expense of this branch of the public service and at the same time promote usefulness and efficiency circumstance have be recently develop show the existence of extensive fraud under the various law grant pension and gratuity for revolutionary service be impossible to estimate the amount which may have be thus fraudulently obtain from the|national|treasury be satisfied however have be such as to justify a re - examination of the system and the adoption of the necessary check in administration all will agree that the service and suffering of the remnant of revolutionary band should be fully compensate but while this be do every proper precaution should be take to prevent the admission of fabricated and fraudulent claim in the present mode of proceed the attestation and certificate of the judicial officer of the various states from a considerable portion of the check which be interpose against the commission of fraud these however have be and may be fabricate and in such a way as to elude detection at the examine office and independently of this practical difficulty be ascertain that these document be often loosely grant some time even blank certificate have be issue some time prepared paper have be sign without inquiry and in instance at least the seal of the court have be within reach of a person most interested in improper application be obvious that under such circumstance no severity of administration can check the abuse of the law and information have from time to time be communicate to the|pension|office question or deny the right of person place upon the pension list to the bounty of the country such caution be always attend to and examine but a far more general investigation be call for and therefore recommend in conformity with the suggestion of the secretary of war that an actual inspection should be make in each state into the circumstance and claim of every person now draw a pension the honest veteran have nothing to fear from such a scrutiny while the fraudulent claimant will be detect and the public treasury relieve to an amount have reason to believe far great than have heretofore be suspect the detail of such a plan could be so regulated as to interpose the necessary check without any burdensome operation upon the pensioner the object should be fold to look into the original justice of the claim so far as this can be do under a proper system of regulation by an examination of the claimant and by inquire in the vicinity of residence into history and into the opinion entertain of revolutionary service to ascertain in all case whether the original claimant be live and this by actual personal inspection this measure will if adopt be productive think of the desire result and therefore recommend to consideration with the further suggestion that all payment should be suspend til the necessary report be receive will be see by a tabular statement annex to the document transmit to congress that the appropriation for object connect with make at the last session for the service of the|year|1834 exclude the permanent appropriation for the payment of military gratuity under the act of the appropriation of for arming and equip the militia and the appropriation of for the civilization of the indians which be not annually renew amount to the sum of and that the estimate of appropriation necessary for the same branch of service for the|year|1835 amount to the sum of make a difference in the appropriation of the|current|year over the estimate of the appropriation for the next of the principal cause which have operate at this time to produce this great difference be show in the report and document and in the detailed estimate some of these cause be accidental and temporary while other be permanent and aid by a just course of administration may continue to operate beneficially upon the public expenditure a just economy expend where the public service require and withholding where do not be among the indispensable duty of the government refer to the accompanying report of the secretary of the navy and to the document with for a full view of the operation of that important branch of service during the|present|year will be see that the wisdom and liberality with which congress have provide for the gradual increase of navy material have be second by a corresponding zeal and fidelity on the part of those to whom have be confide the execution of the law on the subject and that but a short period would be now require to put in commission a force large enough for any exigency into which the country may be throw when reflect upon position in relation to other nation must be apparent that in the event of conflict with must look chiefly to navy for the protection of national right the wide sea which separate from other government must of necessity be the theater on which an enemy will aim to assail and unless be prepared to meet on this element can not be say to possess the power requisite to repel or prevent aggression can not therefore watch with too much attention this arm of defense or cherish with too much care the mean by which can possess the necessary efficiency and extension to this end policy have be heretofore wisely direct to the constant employment of a force sufficient to guard commerce and to the rapid accumulation of the material which be necessary to repair vessel and construct with ease such new one as may be require in a state of war in accordance with this policy recommend to consideration the erection of the additional dry dock describe by the secretary of the navy and also the construction of the steam battery to which have refer for the purpose of test efficacy as auxiliary to the system of defense now in use the report of the postmaster general herewith submit exhibit the condition and prospect of that department from that document appear that there be a deficit in the fund of the department at the commencement of the|present|year beyond available mean of which on the|first|of|july|last|(1834 have be reduce to appear also that the revenue for the|coming|year will exceed the expenditure about|$270,000 which with the excess of revenue which will result from the operation of the|current|half|year may be expect independently of any increase in the gross amount of postage to supply the entire deficit before the|end|of|1835 but as this calculation be base on the gross amount of postage which have accrue within the period embrace by the time of strike the balance be obvious that without a progressive increase in the amount of postage the exist retrenchment must be persevere in through the|year|1836 that the department may accumulate a surplus fund sufficient to place in a condition of perfect ease will be observe that the revenue of the|post|office|department though have increase and amount be above that of any|former|year have yet fall short of the estimate this be attribute in a great degree to the increase of free letter grow out of the extension and abuse of the franking privilege there have be a gradual increase in the number of executive office to which have be grant and by an act pass in be extend to member of congress throughout the|whole|year be believe that a revision of the law relative to the franking privilege with some enactment to enforce more rigidly the restriction under which be grant would operate beneficially to the country by enable the department at an early period to restore the mail facility that have be withdraw and to extend more widely as the grow settlement of the country may require to a measure so important to the government and so just to constituent who ask no exclusive privilege for and be not willing to concede to other earnestly recommend the serious attention of congress the importance of the|post|office|department and the magnitude to which have grow both in revenue and in operation seem to demand reorganization by law the whole of receipt and disbursement have hitherto be leave entirely to executive control and individual discretion the principle be as sound in relation to this as to any other department|of|the|government that as little discretion should be confide to the executive officer who control as be compatible with efficiency be therefore earnestly recommend that be organize with an auditor and treasurer of own appoint by the president and senate who shall be branch of the|treasury|department attention be again respectfully invite to the defect which exist in the judicial system of the|united|state nothing can be more desirable than the uniform operation of the federal judiciary throughout the several states all of which stand on the same footing as member of the union have equal right to the advantage and benefit result from law this object be not attain by the judicial act now in force because leave one|quarter of the states without circuit court be undoubtedly the duty of congress to place all the states on the same footing in this respect either by the creation of an additional number of associate judge or by an enlargement of the circuit assign to those already appoint so as to include the new states what ever may be the difficulty in a proper organization of the judicial system so as to secure efficiency and uniformity in all part of the union and at the same time to avoid such an increase of judge as would encumber the supreme appellate tribunal should not be allow to weigh against the great injustice which the present operation of the system produce trust that may be also pardon for renew the recommendation have so often submit to attention in regard to the mode of elect the president and vice president of the|united|state all the reflection have be able to bestow upon the subject increase conviction that the good interest of the country will be promote by the adoption of some plan which will secure in all contingency that important right of sovereignty to the direct control of the people could this be attain and the term of those officer be limit to a single period of either four|or|six|year think liberty would possess an additional safeguard at last session call the attention of congress to the destruction of the public building occupy by the|treasury|department as the public interest require that another building should be erect with as little delay as possible be hope that the mean will be seasonably provide and that will be ample enough to authorize such an enlargement and improvement in the plan of the building as will more effectually accommodate the public officer and secure the public document deposit in from the casualty of fire have not be able to satisfy that the bill entitle an act to improve the navigation of the|wabash|river which be send to at the close of last session ought to pass and have therefore withhold from approval and now return to the senate the body in which originate there can be no question connect with the administration of public affair more important or more difficult to be satisfactorily dealth with than that which relate to the rightful authority and proper action of the|federal|government upon the subject of internal improvement to inherent embarrassment have be add other result from the course of legislation concern have heretofore communicate freely with congress upon this subject and in advert to again can not refrain from express increase conviction of extreme importance as well in regard to bearing upon the maintenance of the constitution and the prudent management of the public revenue as on account of disturbing effect upon the harmony of the union be in no danger from violation of the constitution by which encroachment be make upon the personal right of the citizen the sentence of condemnation long since pronounce by the american people upon act of that character will doubt not continue to prove as salutary in effect as be irreversible in nature but against the danger of unconstitutional act which instead of menace the vengeance of offended authority proffer local advantage and bring in train the patronage of the government be fear not so safe to suppose that because government have be institute for the benefit of the people must therefore have the power to do what ever may seem to conduce to the public good be an error into which even honest mind be too apt to fall in yield to this fallacy overlook the great consideration in which the|federal|constitution be found forget that in consequence of the concede diversity in the interest and condition of the different states be foresee at the period of adoption that although a particular measure of the government may be beneficial and proper in state may be the reverse in another that be for this reason the states would not consent to make a grant to the|federal|government of the general and usual power of government but of such only as be specifically enumerate and the probable effect of which could as think safely anticipate and forget also the paramount obligation upon all to abide by the compact then so solemnly and as be hope so firmly establish in addition to the danger to the constitution springing from the source have state there have be which be perhaps great than all allude to the material which this subject have afford for sinister appeal to selfish feeling and the opinion heretofore so extensively entertain of adaptation to the purpose of personal ambition with such stimulus be not surprising that the act and pretension of the|federal|government in this behalf should some time have be carry to an alarming extent the question which have arise upon this subject have relate to the power of make internal improvement within the limit of a state with the right of territorial jurisdiction sufficient at least for preservation and use to the right of appropriate money in aid of such work when carry on by a state of by a company in virtue of state authority surrender the claim of jurisdiction and to the propriety of appropriation for improvement of a particular class viz for light house beacon buoy public pier and for the removal of sand bar sawyer and other temporary and partial impediment in navigable river and harbor the claim of power for the|general|government upon each of these point certainly present matter of the deep interest the first be however of much the great importance in as much as in addition to the danger of unequal and improvident expenditure of public money common to all there be super - add to that the conflicting jurisdiction of the respective government federal jurisdiction at least to the extent have state have be justly regard by advocate as necessarily appurtenant to the power in question if that exist by the constitution that the most injurious conflict would unavoidably arise between the respective jurisdiction of the state and federal|government in the absence of a constitutional provision mark out respective boundary can not be doubt the local advantage to be obtain would induce the states to overlook in the beginning the danger and difficulty to which may ultimately be expose the power exercise by the|federal|government would soon be regard with jealousy by the state authority and originate as must from implication or assumption would be impossible to affix to certain and safe limit opportunity and temptation to the assumption of power incompatible with state sovereignty would be increase and those barrier which resist the tendency of system toward consolidation greatly weaken the officer and agent of the|general|government may not always have the discretion to abstain from intermeddle with state concern and if do would not always escape the suspicion of have do so collision and consequent irritation would spring up that harmony which should ever exist between the|general|government and each member of the confederacy would be frequently interrupt a spirit of contention would be engender and the danger of disunion greatly multiply yet know that not withstand these grave objection this dangerous doctrine be at time apparently proceed to final establishment with fearful rapidity the desi to embark the|federal|government in work of internal improvement prevail in the high degree during the first session of the first congress that have the honor to meet in present situation when the bill authorize a subscription on the part of the|united|state for stock in the maysville and lexington|turnpike|company pass the house there have be report by the|committees|of|internal|improvement bill contain appropriation for such object inclusive of those for the cumberland road and for harbor and light house to the amount of in this amount be include authority to the secretary of the treasury to subscribe for the stock of different company to a great extent and the residue be principally for the direct construction of road by this government in addition to these project which have be present to the houses under the sanction and recommendation of respective committees on internal|improvement there be then still pende before the committee and in memorial to congress present but not refer different project for work of a similar character the expense of which can not be estimate with certainty but must have exceed regard the bill authorize a subscription to the stock of the maysville and lexington|turnpike|company as the enter wedge of a system which however weak at first may soon become strong enough to rive the band of the union asunder and believe that if passage be acquiesce in by the executive and the people there would no longer be any limitation upon the authority of the|general|government in respect to the appropriation of money for such object deem an imperative duty to withhold from the executive approval although from the obviously local character of that work may well have content with a refusal to approve the bill upon that ground yet sensible of the vital importance of the subject and anxious that view and opinion in regard to the whole matter should be fully understand by congress and by constituent feel duty to go further therefore embrace that early occasion to apprise congress that in opinion the constitution do not confer upon the power to authorize the construction of ordinary road and canal within the limit of a state and to say respectfully that no bill admit such a power could receive official sanction do so in the confident expectation that the speedy settlement of the public mind upon the whole subject would be greatly facilitate by the difference between the houses and and that the harmonious action of the several department of the|federal|government in regard to would be ultimately secure so far at least as regard this branch of the subject good hope have be realize nearly|four|year have elapse and several session of congress have intervene and no attempt within recollection have be make to induce congress to exercise this power the application for the construction of road and canal which be formerly multiply upon file be no longer present and have good reason to infer that the current public sentiment have become so decide against the pretension as effectually to discourage reassertion so think derive the great satisfaction from the conviction that thus much at least have be secure upon this important and embarrassing subject from attempt to appropriate the national fund to object which be confessedly of a local character can not trust have anything further to apprehend view in regard to the expediency of make appropriation for work which be claim to be of a national character and prosecute under state authority assume that congress have the right to do so be state in annual message to congress in and also in that contain objection to the maysville road bill so thoroughly convinced be that no such appropriation ought to be make by congress until a suitable constitutional provision be make upon the subject and so essential do regard the point to the high interest of country that could not consider as discharge duty to constituent in give the executive sanction to any bill contain such an appropriation if the people of the united|states desire that the public treasury shall be resort to for the mean to prosecute such work will concur in an amendment of the constitution prescribe a rule by which the national character of the work be to be test and by which the great practicable equality of benefit may be secure to each member of the confederacy the effect of such a regulation would be most salutary in prevent unprofitable expenditure in secure legislation from the pernicious consequence of a scramble for the favor of government and in repress the spirit of discontent which must inevitably arise from an unequal distribution of treasure which belong alike to all there be another class of appropriation for what may be call without impropriety internal improvement which have always be regard as stand upon different ground from those to which have refer allude to such as have for object the improvement of harbor the removal of partial and temporary obstruction in navigable river for the facility and security of foreign commerce the ground upon which distinguish appropriation of this character from other have already be state to congress will now only add that at the 1st session of congress under the new constitution be provide by law that all expense which should accrue from and after the|15th|day|of|august,|1789 in the necessary support and maintenance and repair of all light house beacon buoy and public pier erect place or sink before the passage of the act within any bay inlet harbor or port of the|united|state for render the navigation thereof easy and safe should be defray out of the treasury of the|united|state and further that should be the duty of the secretary of the treasury to provide by contract with the approbation of the president for rebuild when necessary and keep in good repair the light house beacon buoy and public pier in the several states and for furnish with supply appropriation for similar object have be continue from that time to the present without interruption or dispute as a natural consequence of the increase and extension of foreign commerce port of entry and delivery have be multiply and establish not only upon sea board but in the interior of the country upon lake and navigable river the convenience and safety of this commerce have lead to the gradual extension of these expenditure to the erection of light house the placing planting and sinking of buoy beacon and pier and to the removal of partial and temporary obstruction in navigable river and in the harbor upon great|lake as well as on the sea board although have express to congress apprehension that these expenditure have some time be extravagant and disproportionate to the advantage to be derive from have not gelt to be duty to refuse assent to bill contain and have content to follow in this respect in the foot step of all predecessor sensible however from experience and observation of the great abuse to which the unrestricted exercise of this authority by congress be expose have prescribe a limitation for the government of own conduct by which expenditure of this character be confine to place below the port of entry or delivery establish by law be very sentible that this restriction be not as satisfactory as could be desire and that much embarrassment may be cause to the executive department in execution by appropriation for remote and not well understand object but as neither own reflection nor the light which may properly derive from other source have supply with a well shall continue to apply good exertion to a faithful application of the rule upon which be found sincerely regret that could not give assent to the bill entitle an act to improve the navigation of the|wabash|river but could not have do so without recede from the ground which have upon the full consideration take upon this subject and of which congress have be heretofore apprise and without throw the subject again open to abuse which no good citizen entertain opinion could desire rely upon the intelligence and candor of fellow citizen in whose liberal indulgence have already so largely participated for a correct appreciation on motif in interposing as have do on this and other occasion check to a course of legislation which without in the slight degree call in question the motif of other consider as sanction improper and unconstitutional expenditure of public treasure be not hostile to internal improvement and wish to see extend to every part of the country but be fully persuade if be not commence in a proper manner confine to proper object and conduct under an authority generally concede to be rightful that a successful prosecution of can not be reasonably expect the attempt will meet with resistance where may otherwise receive support and instead of strengthen the bond of confederacy will only multiply and aggravate the cause of disunion transcript to the senate of the|united|state have reason to believe that certain passage contain in message and protest transmit to the senate on the|17th|(15th instant may be misunderstood think proper to state that be not intention to deny in the said message the power and right of the legislative department to provide by law for the custody safe keeping and disposition of the public money and property of the|united|state although be well satisfied that such a construction be not warrant by anything contain in that message yet aware from experience that detach passage of an argumentative document when disconnect from context and consider without reference to previous limitation and the particular position be intend to refute or to establish may be make to bear a construction vary altogether front the sentiment really entertain and intend to be express and deeply solicitous that view on this point should not either now or hereafter be misapprehend have deem due to the gravity of the subject to the great interest involve and to the senate as well as to to embrace the early opportunity to make this communication admit without reserve as have before do the constitutional power of the legislature to prescribe by law the place or place in which the public money or other property be to be deposit and to make such regulation concern custody removal or disposition as may think proper to enact nor do claim for the executive any right to the possession or disposition of the public property or treasure or any authority to interfere with the same except when such possession disposition or authority be give to by law nor do claim the right in any manner to supervise or interfere with the person intrust with such property or treasure unless be an officer whose appointment under the constitution and law be devolve upon the president alone or in conjunction with the senate and for whose conduct be constitutionally responsible as the message and protest refer to may appear on the|journal|of|the|senate and remain among the record document of the nation be unwilling that opinion should be impute to even through misconstruction which be not entertain and more particularly be solicitous that may not be suppose to claim for or successor any power or authority not clearly grant by the constitution and law to the president have therefore respectfully to request that this communication may be consider a part of that message and that may be enter therewith on the journal of the senate transcript to the senate of the|united|state appear by the publish journal|of|the|senate that on the|26th|of|december last a resolution be offer by a member of the senate which after a protract debate be on the|28th|day|of|march last modify by the mover and pass by the vote of senator out of who be present and vote in the follow word viz the senate order that be not enter on the journal resolve that the president in the late executive proceeding in relation to the public revenue have assume upon authority and power not confer by the constitution and law but in derogation of both have have the honor through the voluntary suffrage of the american people to fill the office of president of the|united|state during the period which may be presume to have be refer to in this resolution be sufficiently evident that the censure inflict be intend for without notice unheard and untried thus find charge on the record of the senate and in a form hitherto unknown in history with the high crime of violate the law and constitution|of|my country can seldom be necessary for any department of the government when assail in conversation or debate or by the stricture of the press or of popular assembly to step out of ordinary path for the purpose of vindicate conduct or of point out any irregularity or injustice in the manner of the attack but when the chief executive magistrate be by of the most important branch of the government in official capacity in a public manner and by record sentence but without precedent competent authority or just cause declare guilty of a breach of the law and constitution be due to station to public opinion and to a proper self respect that the officer thus denounce should promptly expose the wrong which have be do in the present case moreover there be even a strong necessity for such a vindication by an express provision of the constitution before the president of the|united|state can enter on the execution of office be require to take an oath or affirmation in the following word do solemnly swear or affirm that will faithfully execute the office of president of the|united|state and will to the good of ability preserve protect and defend the|united|state the duty of defend so far as in lie the integrity of the constitution would indeed have result from the very nature of office but by thus express in the official oath or affirmation which in this respect differ from that of any other functionary the founder of republic have attest sense of importance and have give to a peculiar solemnity and force bind to the performance of this duty by the oath have take by the strong obligation of gratitude to the american people and by the tie which unite every earthly interest with the welfare and glory of country and perfectly convince that the discussion and passage of the above mention resolution be not only unauthorized by the constitution but in many respect repugnant to provision and subversive of the right secure by to other coordinate department deem an imperative duty to maintain the supremacy of that sacred instrument and the immunity of the department intrust to care by all mean consistent with own lawful power with the right of other and with the genius of civil institution to this end have cause this solemn protest against the aforesaid proceeding to be place on the file of the executive department and to be transmit to the senate be alike due to the subject the senate and the people that the view which have take of the proceeding refer to and which compel to regard in the light that have be mention should be exhibit at length and with the freedom and firmness which be require by an occasion so unprecedented and peculiar under the|united|stat the power and function of the various department of the|federal|government and responsibility for violation or neglect of duty be clearly define or result by necessary inference the legislative power be subject to the qualified negative of the president vest in compose of the senate and house|of|representatif the executive power be vest exclusively in the president except that in the conclusion of treaty and in certain appointment to office be to act with the advice and consent of the senate the judicial power be vest exclusively in the supreme and other court of the|united|state except in case of impeachment for which purpose the accusatory power be vest in the|house|of|representatives and that of hearing and determine in the senate but although for the special purpose which have be mention there be an occasional intermixture of the power of the different department yet with these exception each of the great department be independent of the other in sphere of action and when deviate from that sphere be not responsible to the other further than be expressly make so in the constitution in every other respect each of be the coequal of the other and all be the servant of the american people without power or right to control or censure each other in the service of common superior save only in the manner and to the degree which that superior have prescribe the responsibility of the president be numerous and weighty be liable to impeachment for high crime and misdemeanor and on due conviction to removal from office and perpetual disqualification and notwithstanding such conviction may also be indict and punish accord to law be also liable to the private action of any party who may have be injure by illegal mandate or instruction in the same manner and to the same extent as the humble functionary in addition to the responsibility which may thus be enforce by impeachment criminal prosecution or suit at law be also accountable at the bar of public opinion for every act of administration subject only to the restraint of truth and justice the free people of the|united|state have the undoubted right as individual or collectively orally or in writing at such time and in such language and form as may think proper to discuss official conduct and to express and promulgate opinion concern indirectly also conduct may come under review in either branch of the legislature or in the senate when act in executive capacity and so far as the executive or legislative proceeding of these body may require may be exercise by these be believe to be the proper and only mode in which the president of the|united|state be to be hold accountable for official conduct test by these principle the resolution of the senate be wholly unauthorized by the constitution and in derogation of entire spirit assume that a single branch of the legislative department may for the purpose of a public censure and without any view to legislation or impeachment take up consider and decide upon the official act of the executive but in no part of the constitution be the president subject to any such responsibility and in no part of that instrument be any such power confer on either branch of the legislature the justice of these conclusion will be illustrate and confirm by a brief analysis of the power of the senate and a comparison of recent proceeding with those power the high function assign by the constitution to the senate be in nature either legislative executive or judicial be only in the exercise of judicial power when sit as a court for the trial of impeachment that the senate be expressly authorize and necessarily require to consider and decide upon the conduct of the president or any other public officer indirectly however as have already be suggest may frequently be call on to perform that office case may occur in the course of legislative or executive proceeding in which may be indispensable to the proper exercise of power that should inquire into and decide upon the conduct of the president or other public officer and in every such case constitutional right to do so be cheerfully concede but to authorize the senate to enter on such a task in legislative or executive capacity the inquiry must actually grow out of and tend to some legislative or executive action and the decision when express must take the form of some appropriate legislative or executive act the resolution in question be introduce discuss and pass not as a joint but as a separate resolution assert no legislative power propose no legislative action and neither possess the form nor any of the attribute of a legislative measure do not appear to have be entertain or pass with any view or expectation of issuing in a law or joint resolution or in the repeal of any law or joint resolution or in any other legislative action whilst want both the form and substance of a legislative measure be equally manifest that the resolution be not justify by any of the executive power confer on the senate these power relate exclusively to the consideration of treaty and nomination to office and be exercise in secret session and with closed door this resolution do not apply to any treaty or nomination and be pass in a public session nor do this proceeding in any way belong to that class of incidental resolution which relate to the officer of the senate to chamber and other appurtenance or to subject of order and other matter of the like nature in all which either house may lawfully proceed without any cooperation with the other or with the president on the contrary the whole phraseology and sense of the resolution seem to be judicial essence true character and only practical effect be to be find in the conduct which enlarge upon the president and in the judgment which pronounce on that conduct the resolution therefore though discuss and adopt by the senate in legislative capacity be in office and in all characteristic essentially judicial that the senate possess a high judicial power and that instance may occur in which the president of the|united|state will be amenable to be undeniable but under the provision of the constitution would seem to be equally plain that neither the president nor any other officer can be rightfully subject to the operation of the judicial power of the senate except in the case and under the form prescribe by the constitution the constitution declare that the president vice president and all civil officer of the|united|state shall be remove from office on impeachment for and conviction of treason bribery or other high crime and misdemeanor that the|house|of|representatives shall have the sole power of impeachment that the senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachment that when sit for that purpose shall be on oath or affirmation that when the president of the|united|state be try the chief justice shall preside that no person shall be convict without the concurrence of third of the member present and that judgment shall not extend further than to removal from office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor trust or profit under the|united|state the resolution above quote charge in substance that in certain proceeding relate to the public revenue the president have usurped authority and power not confer upon by the constitution and law and that in do so violate both any such act constitute a high crime of the high indeed which the president can commit a crime which justly expose to impeachment by the|house|of|representatives and upon due conviction to removal from office and to the complete and immutable disfranchisement prescribe by the constitution the resolution then be in substance an impeachment of the president and in passage amount to a declaration by a majority of the senate that be guilty of an impeachable offense as such be spread upon the journal of the senate publish to the nation and to the world make part of endure archive and incorporate in the history of the age the punishment of removal from office and future disqualification do not be true follow this decision nor would have follow the like decision if the regular form of proceeding have be pursue because the requisite number do not concur in the result but the moral influence of a solemn declaration by a majority of the senate that the accuse be guilty of the offense charge upon have be as effectually secure as if the like declaration have be make upon an impeachment express in the same term indeed a great practical effect have be gain because the vote give for the resolution though not sufficient to authorize a judgment of guilty on an impeachment be numerous enough to carry that resolution that the resolution do not expressly allege that the assumption of power and authority which condemn be intentional and corrupt be no answer to the precede view of character and effect the act thus condemn necessarily imply volition and design in the individual to whom be impute and be unlawful in character the legal conclusion be that be prompt by improper motif and commit with an unlawful intent the charge be not of a mistake in the exercise of suppose power but of the assumption of power not confer by the constitution and law but in derogation of both and nothing be suggest to excuse or palliate the turpitude of the act in the absence of any such excuse or palliation there be only room for inference and that be that the intent be unlawful and corrupt besides the resolution not only contain no mitigating suggestion but on the contrary hold up the act complain of as justly obnoxious to censure and reprobation and thus as distinctly stamp with impurity of motive as if the strong epithet have be use the president of the|united|state therefore have be by a majority of constitutional trier accuse and find guilty of an impeachable offense but in no part of this proceeding have the direction of the constitution be observe the impeachment instead of be prefer and prosecute by the|house|of|representatives originate in the senate and be prosecute without the aid or concurrence of the other house the oath or affirmation prescribe by the constitution be not take by the senators the chief justice do not preside no notice of the charge be give to the accuse and no opportunity afford to respond to the accusation to meet accuser face to face to cross - examine the witness to procure counteracting testimony or to be hear in defense the safeguard and formality which the constitution have connect with the power of impeachment be doubtless suppose by the framer of that instrument to be essential to the protection of the public servant to the attainment of justice and to the order impartiality and dignity of the procedure these safeguard and formality be not only practically disregard in the commencement and conduct of these proceeding but in result find convict by third of the member present of an impeachable offense in vain may be allege in defense of this proceeding that the form of the resolution be not that of an impeachment or of a judgment thereupon that the punishment prescribe in the constitution do not follow adoption or that in this case no impeachment be to be expect from the|house|of|representatives be because do not assume the form of an impeachment that be the more palpably repugnant to the constitution for be through that form only that the president be judicially responsible to the senate and though neither removal from office nor future disqualification ensue yet be not to be presume that the framer of the constitution consider either or both of those result as constitute the whole of the punishment prescribe the judgment of guilty by the high tribunal in the union the stigma would inflict on the offender family and fame and the perpetual record on the journal hand down to future generation the story of disgrace be doubtless regard by as the bitter portion if not the very essence of that punishment so far therefore as some of most material part be concern the passage recording and promulgation of the resolution be an attempt to bring on the president in a manner unauthorized by the constitution to shield and other officer who be liable to impeachment from consequence so momentous except when really merit by official delinquency the constitution have most carefully guard the whole process of impeachment a majority of the|house|of|representatives must think the officer guilty before can be charge third of the senate must pronounce guilty or be deem to be innocent senator appear by the journal to have be present when the vote on the resolution be take if after all the solemnity of an impeachment of those senators have vote that the president be guilty yet would have be acquit but by the mode of proceed adopt in the present case a lasting record of conviction have be enter up by the vote of senator without an impeachment or trial whilst the constitution expressly declare that to the entry of such a judgment an accusation by the|house|of|representatives a trial by the senate and a concurrence of third in the vote of guilty shall be indispensable prerequisite whether or not an impeachment be to be expect from the|house|of|representatives be a point on which the senate have no constitutional right to speculate and in respect to which even have possess the spirit of prophecy anticipation would have furnish no just ground for this procedure admit that there be reason to believe that a violation of the constitution and law have be actually commit by the president still be the duty of the senate as sole constitutional judge to wait for an impeachment until the other house should think proper to prefer the member of the senate could have no right to infer that no impeachment be intend on the contrary every legal and rational presumption on part ought to have be that if there be good reason to believe guilty of an impeachable offense the|house|of|representatives would perform constitutional duty by arraign the offender before the justice of country the contrary presumption would involve an implication derogatory to the integrity and honor of the representative of the people but suppose the suspicion thus imply be actually entertain and for good cause how can justify the assumption by the senate of power not confer by the constitution be only necessary to look at the condition in which the senate and the president have be place by this proceeding to perceive utter incompatibility with the provision and the spirit of the constitution and with the plain dictate of humanity and justice if the|house|of|representatives shall be of opinion that there be just ground for the censure pronounce upon the president then will be the solemn duty of that house to prefer the proper accusation and to cause to be bring to trial by the constitutional tribunal but in what condition would find that tribunal a majority of member have already consider the case and have not only form but express a deliberate judgment upon merit be the policy of benign system of jurisprudence to secure in all criminal proceeding and even in the most trivial litigation a fair unprejudiced and impartial trial and surely can not be less important that such a trial should be secure to the high officer of the government the constitution make the|house|of|representative the exclusive judge in the first instance of the question whether the president have commit an impeachable offense a majority of the senate whose interference with this preliminary question have for the good of all reason be studiously exclude anticipate the action of the|house|of|representatives assume not only the function which belong exclusively to that body but convert into accuser witness counsel and judge and prejudge the whole case thus present the appalling spectacle in a free state of judge go through a labored preparation for an impartial hearing and decision by a previous parte investigation and sentence against the suppose offender there be no more settled axiom in that government whence derive the model of this part of constitution than that the lord can not impeach any to nor join in the accusation because be judge independently of the general reason on which this rule be found propriety and importance be greatly increase by the nature of the impeaching power the power of arraign the high officer of government before a tribunal whose sentence may expel from seat and brand as infamous be eminently a popular remedy a remedy design to be employ for the protection of private right and public liberty against the abuse of injustice and the encroachment of arbitrary power but the framer of the constitution be also undoubtedly aware that this formidable instrument have be and may be abuse and that from very nature an impeachment for high crime and misdemeanor whatever may be result would in most case be accompany by so much of dishonor and reproach solicitude and suffering as to make the power of prefer of the high solemnity and importance be due to both these consideration that the impeaching power should be lodge in the hand of those who from the mode of election and the tenure of office would most accurately express the popular will and at the same time be most directly and speedily amenable to the people the theory of these wise and benignant intention be in the present case effectually defeat by the proceeding of the senate the member of that body represent not the people but the states and though be undoubtedly responsible to the states yet from extended term of service the effect of that responsibility during the whole period of that term must very much depend upon own impression of obligatory force when a body thus constitute express beforehand opinion in a particular case and thus indirectly invite a prosecution not only assume a power intend for wise reason to be confine to other but shield the latter from that exclusive and personal responsibility under which be intend to be exercise and reverse the whole scheme of this part of the constitution such would be some of the objection to this procedure even if be admit that there be just ground for impute to the president the offense charge in the resolution but if on the other hand the|house|of|representatives shall be of opinion that there be no reason for charge upon and shall therefore deem improper to prefer an impeachment then will the violation of privilege as respect that house of justice as regard the president and of the constitution as relate to both be only the more conspicuous and impressive the constitutional mode of procedure on an impeachment have not only be wholly disregard but some of the first principle of natural right and enlightened jurisprudence have be violate in the very form of the resolution carefully abstain from aver in which of the late proceeding in relation to the public revenue the president have assume upon authority and power not confer by the constitution and law carefully abstain from specify what law or what part of the constitution have be violate why be not the certainty of the offense-- the nature and cause of the accusation --set out in the manner require in the constitution before even the humble individual for the small crime can be expose to condemnation such a specification be due to the accuse that may direct defense to the real point of attack to the people that may clearly understand in what particular institution have be violate and to the truth and certainty of public annal as the record now stand whilst the resolution plainly charge upon the president at|least|one act of usurpation in the late executive proceeding in relation to the public revenue and be so frame that those senator who believe that such act and only|one have be commit could assent to language be yet broad enough to include several such act and so may have be regard by some of those who vote for but though the accusation be thus comprehensive in the censure imply there be no such certainty of time place or circumstance as to exhibit the particular conclusion of fact or law which induce any senator to vote for and may well have happen that whilst senator believe that some particular act embrace in the resolution be an arbitrary and unconstitutional assumption of power other of the majority may have deem that very act both constitutional and expedient or if not expedient yet still within the pale of the constitution and thus a majority of the senators may have be enable to concur in a vague and undefined accusation that the president in the course of the late executive proceeding in relation to the public revenue have violate the constitution and law whilst if a separate vote have be take in respect to each particular act include within the general term the accuser of the president may on any such vote have be find in the minority still further to exemplify this feature of the proceeding be important to be remark that the resolution as originally offer to the senate specify with adequate precision certain act of the president which denounce as a violation of the constitution and law and that be not until the very close of the debate and when perhaps be apprehend that a majority may not sustain the specific accusation contain in that the resolution be so modify as to assume present form a more striking illustration of the soundness and necessity of the rule which forbid vague and indefinite generality and require a reasonable certainty in all judicial allegation and a more glare instance of the violation of those rule have seldom be exhibit in this view of the resolution must certainly be regard not as a vindication of any particular provision of the law or the constitution but simply as an official rebuke or condemnatory sentence too general and indefinite to be easily repel but yet sufficiently precise to bring into discredit the conduct and motif of the executive but whatever may have be intend to accomplish be obvious that the vague general and abstract form of the resolution be in perfect keeping with those other departure from first principle and settle improvement in jurisprudence so properly the boast of free country in modern time and be not too much to say of the whole of these proceeding that if shall be approve and sustain by an intelligent people then will that great contest with arbitrary power which have establish in statute in bill of right in sacred charter and in constitution of government the right of every citizen to a notice before trial to a bearing before conviction and to an impartial tribunal for decide on the charge have be wag in vain if the resolution have be leave in original form be not to be presume that could ever have receive the assent of a majority of the senate for the act therein specify as violation of the constitution and law be clearly within the limit of the executive authority be the dismiss the late secretary of the treasury because would not contrary to sense of own duty remove the money of the|united|state in deposit with the|bank|of|the|united|state and branch in conformity with the president 's opinion and appoint successor to effect such removal which have be do but as no other specification have be substitute and as these be the executive proceeding in relation to the public revenue principally refer to in the course of the discussion will doubtless be generally regard as the act intend to be denounce as an assumption of authority and power not confer by the constitution or law but in derogation of both be therefore due to the occasion that a condensed summary of the view of the executive in respect to should be here exhibit by the constitution the executive power be vest in a president of the|united|state among the duty impose upon and which be swear to perform be that of take care that the law be faithfully execute be thus make responsible for the entire action of the executive department be but reasonable that the power of appointing oversee and control those who execute the law a power in nature executive should remain in hand be therefore not only right but the constitution make duty to nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate appoint all officer of the|united|state whose appointment be not in the constitution otherwise provide for with a proviso that the appointment of inferior officer may be vest in the president alone in the court of justice or in the head of departments the executive power vest in the senate be neither that of nominate nor appoint be merely a check upon the executive power of appointment if individual be propose for appointment by the president by deem incompetent or unworthy may withhold consent and the appointment can not be make check the action of the executive but can not in relation to those very subject act nor direct selection be still make by the president and the negative give to the senate without diminish responsibility furnish an additional guaranty to the country that the subordinate executive as well as the judicial office shall be fill with worthy and competent man the whole executive power be vest in the president who be responsible for exercise be a necessary consequence that should have a right to employ agent of own choice to aid in the performance of duty and to discharge when be no longer willing to be responsible for act in strict accordance with this principle the power of removal which like that of appointment be an original executive power be leave unchecked by the constitution in relation to all executive officer for whose conduct the president be responsible while be take from in relation to judicial officer for whose act be not responsible in the government from which many of the fundamental principle of system be derive the head of the executive department originally have power to appoint and remove at will all officer executive and judicial be to take the judge out of this general power of removal and thus make independent of the executive that the tenure of office be change to good behavior nor be conceivable why be place in constitution upon a tenure different from that of all other officer appoint by the executive unless be for the same purpose but if there be any just ground for doubt on the face of the constitution whether all executive officer be removable at the will of the president be obviate by the contemporaneous construction of the instrument and the uniform practice under the power of removal be a topic of solemn debate in the congress of while organize the administrative department of the government and be finally decide that the president derive from the constitution the power of removal so far as regard that department for whose act be responsible although the debate cover the whole ground embrace the treasury as well as all the other executive|department arise on a motion to strike out of the bill to establish a|department|of|foreign|affair since call the|department|of|state a clause declare the secretary to be removable from office by the president of the|united|state after that motion have be decide in the negative be perceive that these word do not convey the sense of the|house|of|representatives in relation to the true source of the power of removal with the avow object of prevent any future inference that this power be exercise by the president in virtue of a grant from congress when in fact that body consider as derive from the constitution the word which have be the subject of debate be strike out and in lieu thereof a clause be insert in a provision concern the chief clerk of the department which declare that whenever the say principal officer shall be remove from office by the president of the|united|state or in any other case of vacancy the chief clerk should during such vacancy have charge of the paper of the office this change have be make for the express purpose of declare the sense of congress that the president derive the power of removal from the constitution the act as pass have always be consider as a full expression of the sense of the legislature on this important part of the|american|constitution here then have the concurrent authority of president washington of the senate and the|house|of|representatives number of whom have take an active part in the convention which frame the constitution and in the state convention which adopt that the president derive an unqualified power of removal from that instrument which be beyond the reach of legislative authority upon this principle the government have now be steadily administer for about|forty five|years during which there have be numerous removal make by the president or by direction embrace every grade of executive officer from the head of departments to the messenger of bureaus the|treasury|department in the discussion of be consider on the same footing as the other executive|department and in the act establish be incorporate the precise word indicative of the sense of congress that the president derive power to remove the secretary from the constitution which appear in the act establish the|department|of|foreign|affairs an assistant secretary of the treasury be create and be provide that should take charge of the book and paper of the department whenever the secretary shall be remove from office by the president of the|united|state the secretary of the treasury be appoint by the president and be consider as constitutionally removable by appear never to have occur to anyone in the congress of or since until very recently that be other than an executive officer the mere instrument of the chief magistrate in the execution of the law subject like all other head of departments to supervision and control no such idea as an officer of the congress can be find in the constitution or appear to have suggest to those who organize the government there be officer of each house the appointment of which be authorize by the constitution but all officer refer to in that instrument as come within the appoint power of the president whether establish thereby or create by law be officer of the|united|state no joint power of appointment be give to the houses|of|congress nor be there any accountability to as body but as soon as any office be create by law of whatever name or character the appointment of the person or person to fill devolve by the constitution upon the president with the advice and consent of the senate unless be an inferior office and the appointment be vest by the law in the president alone in the court of law or in the head of departments but at the time of the organization of the|treasury|department an incident occur which distinctly evince the unanimous concurrence of the|first|congress in the principle that the|treasury|department be wholly executive in character and responsibility a motion be make to strike out the provision of the bill make the duty of the secretary to digest and report plan for the improvement and management of the revenue and for the support of public credit on the ground that would give the executive department of the government too much influence and power in congress the motion be not oppose on the ground that the secretary be the officer of congress and responsible to that body which would have be conclusive if admit but on other ground which concede executive character throughout the whole discussion evince an unanimous concurrence in the principle that the secretary of the treasury be wholly an executive officer and the struggle of the minority be to restrict power as such from that time down to the present the secretary of the treasury the treasurer register comptrollers auditors and clerk who fill the office of that department have in the practice of the government be consider and treat as on the same footing with correspond grade of officer in all the other executive|department the custody of the public property under such regulation as may be prescribe by legislative authority have always be consider an appropriate function of the executive department in this and all other government in accordance with this principle every specie of property belong to the|united|state except that which be in the use of the several coordinate department of the government as mean to aid in perform appropriate function be in charge of officer appoint by the president whether be land or building or merchandise or provision or clothing or arm and munition of war the superintendent and keeper of the whole be appoint by the president responsible to and removable at will public money be but a species of public property can not be raise by taxation or custom nor bring into the treasury in any other way except by law but whenever or howsoever obtain custody always have be and always must be unless the constitution be change intrust to the executive department no officer can be create by congress for the purpose of take charge of whose appointment would not by the constitution at once devolve on the president and who would not be responsible to for the faithful performance of duty the legislative power may undoubtedly bind and the president by any law may think proper to enact may prescribe in what place particular portion of the public property shall be keep and for what reason shall be remove as may direct that supply for the army or navy shall be keep in particular store and will be the duty of the president to see that the law be faithfully execute yet will the custody remain in the executive department of the government be the congress to assume with or without a legislative act the power of appoint officer independently of the president to take the charge and custody of the public property contain in the military and naval arsenal magazine and storehouse be believe that such an act would be regard by all as a palpable usurpation of executive power subversive of the form as well as the fundamental principle of government but where be the difference in principle whether the public property be in the form of arm munition of war and supply or in gold and silver or bank note none can be perceive none be believe to exist congress can not therefore take out of the hand of the executive department the custody of the public property or money without an assumption of executive power and a subversion of the first principle of the constitution the|congress|of|the|united|state have never pass an act imperatively direct that the public money shall be keep in any particular place or place from the origin of the government to the year the statute book be wholly silent on the subject in a treasurer be create subordinate to the secretary of the treasury and through to the president be require to give bond safely to keep and faithfully to disburse the public money without any direction as to the manner or place in which should be keep by reference to the practice of the government be find that from first organization the secretary of the treasury act under the supervision of the president designate the place in which the public money should be keep and especially direct all transfer from place to place this practice be continue with the silent acquiescence of congress from down to and although many bank be select and discharge and although a portion of the money be first place in the state bank and then in the former bank|of|the|united|state and upon the dissolution of that be again transfer to the state bank no legislation be think necessary by congress and all the operation be originate and perfect by executive authority the secretary of the treasury responsible to the president and with approbation make contract and arrangement in relation to the whole subject matter which be thus entirely commit to the direction of the president under responsibility to the american people and to those who be authorize to impeach and punish for any breach of this important trust the act of establish the|bank|of|the|united|state direct the deposit of public money to be make in that bank and branch in place in which the say bank and branch thereof may be establish unless the secretary of the treasury should otherwise order and direct in which event be require to give reason to congress this be but a continuation of preexist power as the head of an|executive|department to direct where the deposit should be make with the superadded obligation of give reason to congress for make elsewhere than in the|bank|of|the|united|state and branch be not to be consider that this provision in any degree alter the relation between the secretary of the treasury and the president as the responsible head of the executive department or release the latter from constitutional obligation to take care that the law be faithfully execute on the contrary increase responsibility by add another to the long list of law which be duty to carry into effect would be an extraordinary result if because the person charge by law with a public duty be of secretaries be less the duty of the president to see that law faithfully execute than other law enjoin duty upon subordinate officer or private citizen if there be any difference would seem that the obligation be the strong in relation to the former because the neglect be in presence and the remedy at hand can not be doubt that be the legal duty of the secretary of the treasury to order and direct the deposit of the public money to be make elsewhere than in the|bank|of|the|united|state whenever sufficient reason exist for make the change if in such a case neglect or refuse to act would neglect or refuse to execute the law what would be the swear duty of the president could say that the constitution do not bind to see the law faithfully execute because be of secretaries and not upon whom the service be specially impose may not be ask whether there be any such limitation to obligation prescribe in the constitution whether be not equally bind to take care that the law be faithfully execute whether impose duty on the high officer of state or the low subordinate in any of the departments may not be tell that be for the sole purpose of cause all executive officer from the high to the low faithfully to perform the service require of by law that the people of the|united|state have make chief magistrate and the constitution have clothe with the entire executive power of this government the principle imply in these question appear too plain to need elucidation but here also have a contemporaneous construction of the act which show that be not understand as in any way change the relation between the president and secretary of the treasury or as place the latter out of executive control even in relation to the deposit of the public money nor on that point be leave to any equivocal testimony the document of the|treasury|department show that the secretary of the treasury do apply to the president and obtain approbation and sanction to the original transfer of the public deposit to the present bank|of|the|united|state and do carry the measure into effect in obedience to decision also show that transfer of the public deposit from the branch of the|bank|of|the|united|state to state bank at chillicothe cincinnati and louisville in be make with the approbation of the president and by authority show that upon all important question appertain to department whether relate to the public deposit or other matter be the constant practice of the secretary of the treasury to obtain for act the approval and sanction of the president these act and the principle on which be round be know to all the department of the government to congress and the country and until very recently appear never to have be call in question thus be settle by the constitution the law and the whole practice of the government that the entire executive power be vest in the president of the|united|state that as incident to that power the right of appoint and remove those officer who be to aid in the execution of the law with such restriction only as the constitution prescribe be vest in the president that the secretary of the treasury be of those officer that the custody of the public property and money be an executive function which in relation to the money have always be exercise through the secretary of the treasury and subordinate that in the performance of these duty be subject to the supervision and control of the president and in all important measure have relation to consult the chief magistrate and obtain approval and sanction that the law establish the bank do not as could not change the relation between the president and the secretary do not release the former from obligation to see the law faithfully execute nor the latter from the president 's supervision and control that afterwards and before the secretary do in fact consult and obtain the sanction of the president to transfer and removal of the public deposit and that all department of the government and the nation approve or acquiesce in these act and principle as in strict conformity with constitution and law during the|last|year the approach termination accord to the provision of charter and the solemn decision of the american people of the|bank|of|the|united|state make expedient and expose abuse and corruption make in opinion the duty of the secretary of the treasury to place the money of the|united|state in other depository the secretary do not concur in that opinion and decline give the necessary order and direction so glare be the abuse and corruption of the bank so evident fixed purpose to persevere in and so palpable design by money and power to control the government and change character that deem the imperative duty of the executive authority by the exertion of every power confide to by the constitution and law to check career and lessen ability to do mischief even in the painful alternative of dismiss the head of of the departments at the time the removal be make other cause sufficient to justify exist but if have not the secretary would have be dismiss for this cause only place supply by whose opinion be well known to and whose frank expression of in another situation and generous sacrifice of interest and feeling when unexpectedly call to the station now occupy ought forever to have shield motif from suspicion and character from reproach in accordance with the view long before express by proceed with sanction to make arrangement for deposit the money of the|united|state in other safe institution the resolution of the senate as originally frame and as pass if refer to these act presuppose a right in that body to interfere with this exercise of executive power if the principle be once admit be not difficult to perceive where may end if by a mere denunciation like this resolution the president should ever be induce to act in a matter of official duty contrary to the honest conviction of own mind in compliance with the wish of the senate the constitutional independence of the executive department would be as effectually destroy and power as effectually transfer to the senate as if that end have be accomplish by an amendment of the constitution but if the senate have a right to interfere with the executive power have also the right to make that interference effective and if the assertion of the power imply in the resolution be silently acquiesce in may reasonably apprehend that will be follow at by an attempt at actual enforcement the senate may refuse except on the condition that will surrender opinion to and obey will to perform own constitutional function to pass the necessary law to sanction appropriation propose by the|house|of|representatives and to confirm proper nomination make by the president have already be maintain and be not conceivable that the resolution of the senate can be base on any other principle that the secretary of the treasury be the officer of congress and independent of the president that the president have no right to control and consequently none to remove with the same propriety and on similar ground may the secretary of state the|secretaries|of|war and the navy and the postmaster general each in succession be declare independent of the president the subordinate of congress and removable only with the concurrence of the senate follow to consequence this principle will be find effectually to destroy coordinate department of the government to concentrate in the hand of the senate the whole executive power and to leave the president as powerless as would be useless the shadow of authority after the substance have depart the time and the occasion which have call forth the resolution of the senate seem to impose upon an additional obligation not to pass over in silence five|years have the president exercise without a question as to rightful authority those power for the recent assumption of which be now denounce the vicissitude of peace and war have attend government violent party watchful to take advantage of any seem usurpation on the part of the executive have distract council frequent removal or force resignation in every sense tantamount to removal have be make of the secretary and other officer of the treasury and yet in no instance be know that any man whether patriot or partisan have raise voice against as a violation of the constitution the expediency and justice of such change in reference to public officer of all grade have frequently be the topic of discussion but the constitutional right of the president to appoint control and remove the head of the treasury as well as all other departments seem to have be universally concede and what be the occasion upon which other principle have be first officially assert the|bank|of|the|united|state a great moneyed monopoly have attempt to obtain a renewal of charter by control the election of the people and the action of the government the use of corporate fund and power in that attempt be fully disclose and be make known to the president that the corporation be put in train the same course of measure with the view of make another vigorous effort through an interference in the election of the people to control public opinion and force the government to yield to demand this with corruption of the press violation of charter exclusion of the government director from proceeding neglect of duty and arrogant pretension make in the opinion of the president incompatible with the public interest and the safety of institution that should be longer employ as the fiscal agent of the treasury a secretary of the treasury appoint in the recess of the senate who have not be confirm by that body and whom the president may or may not at pleasure nominate to refuse to do what superior in the executive department consider the most imperative of duty and become in fact however innocent motif the protector of the bank and on this occasion be discover for the first time that those who frame the constitution misunderstood that the|first|congress and all successor have be under a delusion that the practice of near five|years be but a continued usurpation that the secretary of the treasury be not responsible to the president and that to remove be a violation of the constitution and law for which the president deserve to stand forever dishonor on the journal of the senate there be also some other circumstance connect with the discussion and passage of the resolution to which feel to be not only right but duty to refer appear by that among the senator who vote for the resolution on final passage and who have support in debate in original form be of the senators from the|state|of|maine the senators from new|jersey and of the senators from ohio also appear by the same journal and by the file of the senate that the legislature of these states have severally express opinion in respect to the executive proceeding draw in question before the senate the branch of the legislature of the|state|of|maine on the|25th|of|january,|1834 pass a preamble and series of resolution in the following word whereas at an early period after the election of andrew|jackson to the presidency in accordance with the sentiment which have uniformly express the attention of congress be call to the constitutionality and expediency of the renewal of the charter of the|united|states|bank and whereas the bank have transcend chartered limit in the management of business transaction and have abandon the object of creation by engage in political controversy by wield power and influence to embarrass the|administration|of|the|general|government and by bring insolvency and distress upon the commercial community and whereas the public security from such an institution consist less in present pecuniary capacity to discharge liability than in the fidelity with which the trust repose in have be execute and whereas the abuse and misapplication of the power confer have destroy the confidence of the public in the officer of the bank and demonstrate that such power endanger the stability of republican institution therefore resolve that in the removal of the public deposit from the|bank|of|the|united|state as well as in the manner of removal recognize in the administration an adherence to constitutional right and the performance of a public duty resolve that this legislature entertain the same opinion as heretofore express by precede legislature of this state that the|bank|of|the|united|state ought not to be rechartere resolve that the senator of this state in the congress of the|united|state be instruct and the representatives be request to oppose the restoration of the deposit and the renewal of the charter of the|united|states|bank on the|11th|of|january,|1834 the house of assembly and council compose the legislature of the state of new|jersey pass a preamble and a series of resolution in the following word whereas the present crisis in public affair call for a decided expression of the voice of the people of this state and whereas consider the undoubted right of the legislature of the several states to instruct those who represent interest in the council of the nation in all matter which intimately concern the public weal and may affect the happiness or well being of the people therefore be resolve by the council and general assembly of this state that while acknowledge with feeling of devout gratitude obligation to the|great|ruler|of|nation for mercy to as a people that have be preserve alike from foreign war from the evil of internal commotion and the machination of design and ambitious man who would prostrate the fair fabric of union that ought nevertheless to humble in presence and implore aid for the perpetuation of republican institution and for a continuance of that unexampled prosperity which country have hitherto enjoy resolve that have undiminished confidence in the integrity and firmness of the venerable patriot who now hold the distinguished post of chief magistrate of this nation and whose purity of purpose and elevated motif have so often receive the unqualified approbation of a large majority of fellow citizen resolve that view with agitation and alarm the existence of a great moneyed incorporation which threaten to embarrass the operation of the government and by mean of unbounded influence upon the currency of the country to scatter distress and ruin throughout the community and that therefore solemnly believe the present bank|of|the|united|state ought not to be rechartere resolve that senator in congress be instruct and member of the|house|of|representatives be request to sustain by vote and influence the course adopt by the secretary of the treasury mr. taney in relation to the|bank|of|the|united|state and the deposit of the government money believe as do the course of the secretary to have be constitutional and that the public good require adoption resolve that the governor be request to forward a copy of the above resolution to each of senator and representatives from this state to on the|21st|day|of|february last the legislature of the same state reiterate the opinion and instruction before give by joint resolution in the following word resolve by the council and general assembly of the state of new|jersey that do adhere to the resolution pass by on the|11th|day|of|january|last relative to the president of the|united|state the|bank|of|the|united|state and the course of mr. taney in remove the government deposit resolve that the legislature of new|jersey have not see any reason to depart from such resolution since the passage thereof and be wish that should receive from senator and representatives of this state in the congress of the|united|state that attention and obedience which be due to the opinion of a sovereign state openly express in legislative capacity on the of january,|1834 the senate and house of representative compose the legislature of ohio pass a preamble and resolution in the following word whereas there be reason to believe that the|bank|of|the|united|state will attempt to obtain a renewal of charter at the present session of congress and whereas be abundantly evident that say bank have exercise power derogatory to the spirit of free institution and dangerous to the liberty of these|united|states and whereas there be just reason to doubt the constitutional power of congress to grant act of incorporation for banking purpose out of and whereas believe the proper disposal of the public land to be of the utmost importance to the people of these|united|states and that honor and good faith require equitable distribution therefore resolve by the general assembly of the|state of ohio that consider the removal of the public deposit from the|bank|of|the|united|state as require by the good interest of country and that a proper sense of public duty imperiously demand that that institution should be no longer use as a depository of the public fund resolve also that view with decided disapprobation the renew attempt in congress to secure the passage of the bill provide for the disposal of the public domain upon the principle propose by mr. clay inasmuch as believe that such a law would be unequal in operation and unjust in result resolve also that heartily approve of the principle set forth in the late veto message upon that subject and resolve that senator in congress be instruct and representatives request to use influence to prevent the rechartering of the|bank|of|the|united|state to sustain the administration in removal of the public deposit and to oppose the passage of a land bill contain the principle adopt in the act upon that subject pass at the last session of congress resolve that the governor be request to transmit copy of the forego preamble and resolution to each of senator and representatives be thus see that senator have declare by vote that the president in the late executive proceeding in relation to the revenue have be guilty of the impeachable offense of assume upon authority and power not confer by the constitution and law but in derogation of both whilst the legislature of respective states have deliberately approve those very proceeding as consistent with the constitution and demand by the public good if these vote have be give in accordance with the sentiment of the legislature as above express there would have be but vote out of for censure the president and the unprecedented record of conviction could not have be place upon the|journal|of|the|senate in thus refer to the resolution and instruction of the state legislature disclaim and repudiate all authority or design to interfere with the responsibility due from member of the senate to own conscience constituent and country the fact now state belong to the history of these proceeding and be important to the just development of the principle and interest involve in as well as to the proper vindication of the executive department and with that view and that view only be here make the topic of remark the dangerous tendency of the doctrine which deny to the president the power of supervising directing and control the secretary of the treasury in like manner with the other executive officer would soon be manifest in practice be the doctrine to be establish the president be the direct representative of the american people but the secretaries be not if the secretary fo the treasury be independent of the president in the execution of the law then be there no direct responsibility to the people in that important branch of this government to which be commit the care of the national finance and be in the power of the|bank|of|the|united|state or any other corporation body of man or individual if a secretary shall be find to accord with in opinion or can be induce in practice to promote view to control through the whole action of the government so far as be exercise by department in defiance of the chief magistrate elect by the people and responsible to but the evil tendency of the particular doctrine avert to though sufficiently serious would be as nothing in comparison with the pernicious consequence which would inevitably flow from the approbation situational power of arraign and censure the official conduct of the executive in the manner recently pursue such proceeding be eminently calculate to unsettle the foundation of the government to disturb the harmonious action of different department and to break down the check and balance by which the wisdom of framer seek to insure stability and usefulness the honest difference of opinion which occasionally exist between the senate and the president in regard to matter in which both be oblige to participate be sufficiently embarrassing but if the course recently adopt by the senate shall hereafter be frequently pursue be not only obvious that the harmony of the relation between the president and the senate will be destroy but that other and graver effect will ultimately ensue if the censure of the senate be submit to by the president the confidence of the people in ability and virtue and the character and usefulness of administration will soon be at an end and the real power of the government will fall in to the hand of a body hold office for long term not elect by the people and not to directly responsible if on the other hand the illegal censure of the senate should be resist by the president collision and angry controversy may ensue discreditable in progress and in the end compel the people to adopt the conclusion either that chief magistrate be unworthy of respect or that the senate be chargeable with calumny and injustice either of these result would impair public confidence in the perfection of the system and lead to serious alteration of framework or the practical abandonment of some of provision the influence of such proceeding on the other department of the government and more especially on the states could not fail to be extensively pernicious when the judge in the last resort of official misconduct overleap the bound of authority as prescribe by the constitution what general disregard of provision may not example be expect to produce and who do not perceive that such contempt of the|federal|constitution by of most important department would hold out the strong temptation to resistance on the part of the state sovereignty whenever shall suppose just right to have be invade thus all the independent department of the government and the state which compose confederate union instead of attend to appropriate duty and leave those who may offend to be reclaim or punish in the manner point out in the constitution would fall to mutual crimination and recrimination and give to the people confusion and anarchy instead of order and law until at length some form of aristocratic power would be establish on the ruin of the|constitution|or|the|states be break into separate community far be from to charge or to insinuate that the present senate of the|united|state intend tin the most distant way to encourage such a result be not of motif or design but only of the tendency of act that be duty to speak be if possible to make senator sensible of the danger which lurk under the precedent set in resolution and at any rate to perform duty as the responsible head of of the coequal department of the government that have be compel to point out the consequence to which the discussion and passage of the resolution may lead if the tendency of the measure be not check in inception be due to the high trust with which have be charge to those who may be call to succeed in to the representative of the people whose constitutional prerogative have be unlawfully assume to the people and to the states and to the constitution have establish that should not permit provision to be break down by such an attack on the executive department without at least some effort “ to preserve protect and defend with this view and for the reason which have be state do hereby solemnly protest against the aforementioned proceeding of the senate as unauthorized by the constitution contrary to spirit and to several of express provision subversive of that distribution of the power of government which have ordain and establish destructive of the check and safeguard by which those power be intend on the hand to be control and on the other to be protect and calculate by immediate and collateral effect by character and tendency to concentrate in the hand of a body not directly amenable to the people a degree of influence and power dangerous to liberty and fatal to the constitution of choice the resolution of the senate contain an imputation upon private as well as upon public character and as must stand forever on journal can not close this substitute for that defense which have not be allow to present in the ordinary form without remark that have live in vain if be necessary to enter into a formal vindication of character and purpose from such an imputation in vain do bear upon person endure memorial of that contest in which american liberty be purchase in vain have since peril property fame and life in defense of the right and privilege so dearly buy in vain be now without a personal aspiration or the hope of individual advantage encounter responsibility and danger from which by mere inactivity in relation to a single point may have be exempt if any serious doubt can be entertain as to the purity of purpose and motif if have be ambitious should have seek an alliance with that powerful institution which even now aspire to no divided empire if have be venal should have sell to design have prefer personal comfort and official ease to the performance of arduous duty should have cease to molest in the history of conqueror and usurper never in the fire of youth nor in the vigor of manhood

several installment with the interest thereon to be receive from the|french|government and transfer to the|united|state in such manner as may deem best and by the same act of congress the stipulation on the part of the|united|state in the convention be in all respect fulfil not doubt that a treaty thus make and ratify by the government and faithfully execute by the|united|state would be promptly comply with by the other party and desire to avoid the risk and expense of intermediate agency the secretary of the treasury deem advisable to receive and transfer the first installment by mean of a draft upon the french minister of finance a draft for this purpose be accordingly draw in favor of the cashier of the|bank|of|the|united|state for the amount accrue to the|united|state out of the

by the|french|chamber be not know to that up to that period any appropriation have be require of the chambers and although a communication be subsequently make to the chambers by direction of the king recommend that the necessary provision should be make for carry the convention into effect be at an advanced period of the session and the subject be finally postpone until the next meeting of the chambers not withstand have be suppose by the french ministry that the financial stipulation of the treaty can not be carry into effect without an appropriation by the chambers appear to to be not only consistent with the character of france but due to the character of both government as well as to the right of citizen to treat the convention make and ratify in proper form as pledge the good faith of the|french|government for execution and as impose upon each department an obligation to fulfill and have receive assurance through charg at paris and the french minister plenipotentiary at washington and more recently through the minister of the|united|state at paris that the delay have not proceed from any indisposition on the part of the king and minister to fulfill treaty and that measure will be present at the next meeting of the chambers and with a reasonable hope of success to obtain the necessary appropriation be necessary to state however that the document except certain list of vessel capture condemn or burn at sea proper to facilitate the examination and liquidation of the reclamation comprise in the stipulation of the convention and which by the 6th article france engage to communicate to the|united|state by the intermediary of the legation though repeatedly apply for by the american charg d'affaire under instruction from this government have not yet be communicate and this delay be apprehend will necessarily prevent the completion of the duty assign to the commissioner within the time at present prescribe by law the reason for delay to communicate these document have not be explicitly state and this be the more to be regret as be not understand that the interposition of the chambers be in any manner require for the delivery of those paper under these circumstance in a case so important to the interest of citizen and to the character of country and under disappointment so unexpected deem duty however may respect the general assurance to which have advert no longer to delay the appointment of a minister plenipotentiary to paris but to dispatch in season to communicate the result of application to the|french|government at an early period of session accordingly appoint a distinguished citizen for this purpose who proceed on mission in august last and be present to the king early in the|month|of|october be particularly instruct as to all matter connect with the present posture of affair and indulge the hope that with the representation be instruct to make and from the disposition manifest by the king and minister in recent assurance to minister at paris the subject will be early consider and satisfactorily dispose of at the next meeting of the chambers as this subject involve important interest and have attract a considerable share of the public attention have deem proper to make this explicit statement of actual condition and should be disappoint in the hope now entertain the subject will be again bring to the notice of congress in such manner as the occasion may require the friendly relation which have always be maintain between the|united|state and russia have be further extend and strengthen by the treaty of navigation and commerce conclude on and sanction by the senate before the close of last session the ratification have be since exchange the liberal provision of the treaty be now in full force and under the encouragement which have secure a flourishing and increase commerce yield benefit to the enterprise of both nation afford to each the just recompense of wise measure and add new motif for that mutual friendship which the country have hitherto cherish toward each other afford peculiar satisfaction to state that the|government|of|spain have at length yield to the justice of the claim which have be so long urge in behalf of citizen and have express a willingness to provide an indemnification as soon as the proper amount can be agree upon upon this latter point be probable an understanding have take place between the minister of the|united|state and the|spanish|government before the decease of the late king of spain and unless that event may have delay completion there be reason to hope that may be in power to announce to early in present session the conclusion of a convention upon term not less favorable than those enter into for similar object with other nation that act of justice would well accord with the character of spain and be due to the|united|state from ancient friend could not fail to strengthen the sentiment of amity and good will between the nation which be so much the wish of the|united|state to cherish and so truly the interest of both to maintain by the first section of an act of congress pass on the tonnage duty on spanish ship arrive from the port of spain previous to be per ton that act be intend to give effect on side to an arrangement make with the|spanish|government by which discriminate duty of tonnage be to be abolish in the port of the|united|state and spain on vessel of the nation pursuant to that arrangement which be carry into effect on the part of spain on by a royal order date american vessel in the port of spain have pay per ton which rate of duty be also pay in those port by spanish ship but as american vessel pay no tonnage duty in the port of the|united|state the duty of payable in port by spanish vessel under the act above mention be really a discriminate duty operate to the disadvantage of spain though no complaint have yet be make on the part of spain be not the less bind by the obligation of good faith to remove the discrimination and recommend that the act be amend accordingly as the royal order above allude to include the port of the balearic and canary island as well as those of spain would seem that the provision of the act of congress should be equally extensive and that for the repayment of such duty as may have be improperly receive an addition should be make to the sum appropriate at the last session of congress for refund discriminate duty as the arrangement refer to however do not embrace the island of cuba and puerto|rico discriminate duty to the prejudice of american shipping continue to be levy there from the extent of the commerce carry on between the|united|state and those island particularly the former this discrimination cause serious injury to of those great national interest which have be consider an essential part of policy to cherish and have give rise to complaint on the part of merchant under instruction give to minister at madrid earnest representation have be make by to the|spanish|government upon this subject and there be reason to expect from the friendly disposition which be entertain toward this country that a beneficial change will be produce the disadvantage however to which shipping be subject by the operation of these discriminate duty require that be meet by suitable countervailing duty during present session power be at the same time vest in the president to modify or discontinue as the discriminate duty on american vessel or cargo may be modify or discontinue at those island intimation have be give to the|spanish|government that the|united|state may be oblige to resort to such measure as be of necessary self defense and there be no reason to apprehend that would be unfavorably receive the propose proceeding if adopt would not be permit however in any degree to induce a relaxation in the effort of minister to effect a repeal of this irregularity by friendly negotiation and may serve to give force to representation by show the danger to which that valuable trade be expose by the obstruction and burden which a system of discriminate and countervail duty necessarily produce the selection and preparation of the florida archive for the purpose of be deliver over to the|united|state in conformity with the royal order as mention in last annual message though in progress have not yet be complete this delay have be produce partly by cause which be unavoidable particularly the prevalence of the cholera at havana but measure have be take which be believe will expedite the delivery of those important record congress be inform at the opening of the last session that owe as be allege to embarrassment in the finance of portugal consequent upon the civil war in which that nation be engage payment have be make of only|one installment of the amount which the|portuguese|government have stipulate to pay for indemnify citizen for property illegally capture in the blockade of terceira since that time a postponement for two|year with interest of the remain installment be request by the|portuguese|government and as a consideration offer to stipulate that rice of the|united|state should be admit into portugal at the same duty as brazilian rice be satisfied that no well arrangement could be make consent be give and a royal order of the king of portugal be accordingly issue on for the reduction of the duty on rice of the|united|state would give great pleasure if in speaking of that country in whose prosperity the|united|state be so much interested and with whom a long- subsisting extensive and mutually advantageous commercial intercourse have strengthen the relation of friendship could announce to the restoration of internal tranquillity subsequently to the commencement of the last session of congress the final installment payable by denmark under the convention of be receive the commissioner for examine the claim have since terminate labor and award have be pay at the treasury as have be call for the justice render to citizen by that government be thus complete and a pledge be thereby afford for the maintenance of that friendly intercourse become the relation that the nation mutually bear to each other be satisfactory to inform that the|danish|government have recently issue an ordinance by which the commerce with the island of st.|croix be place on a more liberal footing than heretofore this change can not fail to prove beneficial to the trade between the|united|state and that colony and the advantage likely to flow from may lead to great relaxation in the colonial system of other nation the ratification of the convention with the|king|of|the sicilies have be duly exchange and the commissioner appoint for examine the claim under have enter upon the duty assign to by law the friendship that the interest of the nation require of be now establish may be hope that each will enjoy the benefit which a liberal commerce should yield to both a treaty of amity and commerce between the|united|state and belgium be conclude during the|last|winter and receive the sanction of the senate but the exchange of the ratification have be hitherto delay in consequence in the first instance of some delay in the reception of the treaty at brussels and subsequently of the absence of the belgian minister of foreign affair at the important conference in which government be engage at london that treaty do but embody those enlarge principle of friendly policy which be sincerely hope will always regulate the conduct of the nation have such strong motif to maintain amicable relation toward each other and so sincerely desirous to cherish with all the other european power with whom the|united|state have form diplomatic relation and with the sublime porte the good understanding prevail from all continue to receive assurance of good will toward the|united|state assurance which give no less pleasure to reciprocate than to receive with all the engagement which have be enter into be fulfil with good faith on both side measure have also be take to enlarge friendly relation and extend commercial intercourse with other states the system have pursue of aim at no exclusive advantage of deal with all on term of fair and equal reciprocity and of adhere scrupulously to all engagement be well calculated to give success to effort intend to be mutually beneficial the war of which the southern part of this continent be so long the theater and which be carry on either by the mother country against the states which have formerly be colony or by the states against each other have terminate and civil dissension have so far subside as with few exception no longer to disturb the public tranquillity be earnestly hope those states will be able to employ without interruption in perfect institution cultivate the art of peace and promote by wise council and able exertion the public and private prosperity which patriotic struggle so well entitle to enjoy with those states relation have under go but little change during the|present|year no reunion have yet take place between the states which compose the|republic|of|colombia charg d'affaire at bogota have be accredit to the|government|of|new|grenada and have therefore no diplomatic relation with venezuela and equator except as may be include in those heretofore form with the|colombian|republic be understand that representative from the statte be about to assemble at bogota to confer on the subject of mutual interest particularly that of union and if the result should render necessary measure will be take on part to preserve with each that friendship and those liberal commercial connection which have be the constant desire of the|united|state to cultivate with sister republics of this hemisphere until the important question of reunion shall be settle however the different matter which have be under discussion between the|united|state and the|republic|of|colombia or either of the states which compose be not likely to be bring to a satisfactory issue in consequence of the illness of the charg d'affaires appoint to central|america at the last session of congress be prevent from proceed on mission until the|month|of|october be hope however that be by this time at post and that the official intercourse unfortunately so long interrupt have be thus renew on the part of the nation so amicably and advantageously connect by engagement found on the most enlarged principle of commercial reciprocity be gratify to state that since last annual message some of the most important claim of fellow citizen upon the government|of|brazil have be satisfactorily adjust and a reliance be place on the friendly disposition manifest by that justice will also be do in other no new cause of complaint have arise and the trade between the country flourish under the encouragement secure to by the liberal provision of the treaty be cause of regret that owe probably to the civil dissension which have occupy the attention of the|mexican|government the time fix by the treaty of limit with the|united|state for the meeting of the commissioner to define the boundary between the nation have be suffer to expire without the appointment of any commissioner on the part of that government while the true boundary remain in doubt by either party be difficult to give effect to those measure which be necessary to the protection and quiet of numerous citizen reside near that frontier the subject be of great solicitude to the|united|state and will not fail to receive earnest attention the treaty conclude with chili and approve by the senate at last session be also ratify by the|chilian|government but with certain additional and explanatory article of a nature to have require to be again submit to the senate the time limit for the exchange of the ratification however have since expire the action of both government on the treaty will again become necessary the negotiation commence with the|argentine|republic relative to the outrage commit on vessel engage in the fishery at the|falkland|island by person act under the color of authority as well as the other matter in controversy between the government have be suspend by the departure of the charg d'affaires of the|united|state from buenos|ayre be understand however that a minister be subsequently appoint by that government to renew the negotiation in the|united|state but though daily expect have not yet arrive in this country with peru no treaty have yet be form and with bolivia no diplomatic intercourse have yet be establish will be endeavor to encourage those sentiment of amity and that liberal commerce which belong to the relation in which all the independent states of this continent stand toward each other deem proper to recommend to notice the revision of consular system this have become an important branch of the public service in as much as be intimately connect with the preservation of national character abroad with the interest of citizen in foreign country with the regulation and care of commerce and with the protection of sea man at the close of the last session of congress communicate a report from the secretary of state upon the subject to which now refer as contain information which may be useful in any inquiry that congress may see fit to institute with a view to a salutary reform of the system give great pleasure to congratulate upon the prosperous condition of the finance of the country as will appear from the report which the secretary of the treasury will in due time lie before the receipt into the treasury during the|present|year will amount to more|than|$32,000,000 the revenue derive from custom will be believe be more|than|$28,000,000 and the public land will yield about|$3,0900,000 the expenditure within the|year for all object include on account of the public debt will not amount to and a large balance will remain in the treasury after satisfy all the appropriation chargeable on the revenue for the|present|year the measure take by the secretary of the treasury will probably enable to pay off in the course of the|present|year the residue of the exchange % stock redeemable on have therefore be include in the estimate expenditure of this|year and form a part of the sum above state to have be pay on account of the public debt the payment of this stock will reduce the whole debt of the|united|state fund and unfunded to the sum of and as provision have already be make for the % stock above mention and charge in the expense of the|present|year the sum last state be all that now remain of the national debt and the revenue of the|coming|year together with the balance now in the treasury will be sufficient to discharge after meet the current expense of the government under the power give to the commissioner of the sinking fund will have no doubt be purchase on favorable term within the|year from this view of the state of the finance and the public engagement yet to be fulfil will perceive that if providence permit to meet at another session shall have the high gratification of announce to that the national debt be extinguish can not refrain from express the pleasure feel at the near approach of that desirable event the short period of time within which the public debt will have be discharge be strong evidence of the abundant resource of the country and of the prudence and economy with which the government have heretofore be administer have wag war since become a nation with of the most powerful kingdom in the world both of undertake in defense of dear right be successfully prosecute and honorably terminate and many of those who partook in the first struggle as well as in the second will have live to see the last item of the debt incur in these necessary but expensive conflict faithfully and honestly discharge and shall have the proud satisfaction of bequeathing to the public servant who follow in the administration of the government the rare blessing of a revenue sufficiently abundant raise without injustice or oppression to citizen and unencumbered with any burden but what shall think proper to impose upon the flourish state of the finance ought not however to encourage to indulge in a lavish expenditure of the public treasure the receipt of the|present|year do not furnish the test by which be to estimate the income of the next the change make in revenue system by the act of congress of and and more especially by the former have swell the receipt of the|present|year far beyond the amount to be expect in future|year upon the reduced tariff of duty the shortened credit on revenue bond and the cash duty on woolen which be introduce by the act of and take effect on have bring large sum into the treasury in which accord to the credit formerly give would not have be payable until and would have form a part of the income of that|year these cause would of produce a great diminution of the receipt in the|year|1834 as compare with the present and will be still more diminished by the reduce rate of duty which take place on on some of the most important and productive article upon the good estimate that can be make the receipt of the|next|year with the aid of the unappropriated amount now in the treasury will not be much more than sufficient to meet the expense of the|year and pay the small remnant of the national debt which yet remain unsatisfied can not therefore recommend to any alteration in the present tariff of duty the rate as now fix by law on the various article be adopt at the last session of congress as a matter of compromise with unusual unanimity and unless be find to produce more than the necessity of the government call for there would seem to be no reason at this time to justify a change but while forbear to recommend any further reduction of the duty beyond that already provide for by the exist law must earnestly and respectfully press upon congress the importance of abstain from all appropriation which be not absolutely require for the public interest and authorize by the power clearly delegate to the|united|state be begin a new era in government the national debt which have so long be a burden on the treasury will be finally discharge in the course of the|ensuing|year no more memory will afterwards be need than what may be necessary to meet the ordinary expense of the government now then be the proper moment to fix system of expenditure on firm and durable principle and can not too strongly urge the necessity of a rigid economy and an inflexible determination not to enlarge the income beyond the real necessity of the government and not to increase the want of the government by unnecessary and profuse expenditure if a contrary course should be pursue may happen that the revenue of will fall short of the demand upon and after reduce the tariff in order to lighten the burden of the people and provide for a still further reduction to take effect hereafter would be much to be deplore if at should find oblige to retrace step and impose additional taxis to meet unnecessary expenditure be duty on this occasion to call attention to the destruction of the public building occupy by the|treasury|department which happen since the last adjournment of congress a thorough inquiry into the cause of this loss be direct and make at the time the result of which will be duly communicate to take pleasure however in state here that by the laudable exertion of the officer of the department and many of the citizen of the district but few paper be lose and none that will materially affect the public interest the public convenience require that another building should be erect as soon as practicable and in provide for will be advisable to enlarge in some manner the accommodation for the public officer of the several departments and to authorize the erection of suitable depository for the safe keeping of the public document and record since the last adjournment of congress the secretary of the treasury have direct the money of the|united|state to be deposit in certain state bank designate by and will immediately lay before reason for this direction concur with entirely in the view have take on the subject and some|months before the removal urge upon the department the propriety of take that step the near approach of the|day on which the charger will expire as well as the conduct of the bank appear to to call for this measure upon the high consideration of public interest and public duty the extent of misconduct however although know to be great be not at that time fully develop by proof be not until late in the|month|of|august that receive from the government director an official report establish beyond question that this great and powerful institution have be actively engage in attempt to influence the election of the public officer by mean of money and that in violation of the express provision of charter have by a formal resolution place fund at the disposition of president to be employ in sustain the political power of the bank a copy of this resolution be contain in the report of the government director before refer to and how ever the object may be disguise by cautious language no one can doubt that this money be in truth intend for electioneer purpose and the particular us to which be prove to have be apply abundantly show that be so understand not only be the evidence complete as to the past application of the money and power of the bank to electioneer purpose but that the resolution of the board of director authorize the same course to be pursue in future be thus establish by unquestionable proof that the|bank|of|the|united|state be convert into a permanent electioneering engine appear to that the path of duty which the executive department of the government ought to pursue be not doubtful as by the term of the bank charter no officer but the secretary of the treasury could remove the deposit seem to that this authority ought to be at once exert to deprive that great corporation of the support and countenance of the government in such an use of and such an exertion of power in this point of the case the question be distinctly present whether the people of the|united|state be to govern through representative choose by unbiased suffrage or whether the money and power of a great corporation be to be secretly exert to influence judgment and control decision must now be determine whether the bank be to have candidate for all office in the country from the high to the low or whether candidate on both side of political question shall be bring forward as heretofore and support by the usual mean at this time the effort of the bank to control public opinion through the distress of some and the fear of other be equally apparent and if possible more objectionable by a curtailment of accommodation more rapid than any emergency require and even while retain specie to an almost unprecedented amount in vault be attempt to produce great embarrassment in portion of the community while through press know to have be sustain by money attempt by unfounded alarm to create a panic in all these be the mean by which seem to expect that can force a restoration of the deposit and as a necessary consequence extort from congress a renewal of charter be happy to know that through the good sense of people the effort to get up a panic have hitherto fail and that through the increase accommodation which the state bank have be enable to afford no public distress have follow the exertion of the bank and can not be doubt that the exercise of power and the expenditure of money as well as effort to spread groundless alarm will be meet and rebuke as deserve in own sphere of duty should feel call on by the fact disclose to order a scire facia against the bank with a view to put an end to the charter right have so palpably violate be not that the charter will expire as soon as a decision would probably be obtain from the court of last resort call the attention of congress to this subject in last annual message and inform that such measure as be within the reach of the secretary of the treasury have be take to enable to judge whether the public deposit in the|bank|of|the|united|state be entirely safe but that as single power may be inadequate to the object recommend the subject to congress as worthy of serious investigation declare as opinion that an inquiry into the transaction of that institution embrace the branch as well as the principal bank be call for by the credit which be give throughout the country to many serious charge impeach character and which if true may justly excite the apprehension that be no longer a safe depository for the public money the extent to which the examination thus recommend be go into be spread upon journal and be too well known to require to be state such as be make resulted in a report from a majority of the|committee|of|ways|and|mean touch certain specify point only conclude with a resolution that the government deposit may safely be continue in the|bank|of|the|united|states this resolution be adopt at the close of the session by the vote of a majority of the|house|of|representatives although may not always be able to concur in the view of the public interest or the duty of agent which may be take by the other department of the government or either of branch be not withstand wholly incapable of receive otherwise than with the most sincere respect all opinion or suggestion proceed from such a source and in respect to none be more inclined to do so than to the|house|of|representatives but will be see from the brief view at this time take of the subject by as well as the more ample one present by the secretary of the treasury that the change in the deposit which have be order have be deem to be call for by consideration which be not affect by the proceeding refer to and which if correctly view by that department render act a matter of imperious duty come as do for the most part immediately from the people and the states by election and possess the full opportunity to know sentiment the present congress will be sincerely solicitous to carry into full and fair effect the will of constituent in regard to this institution will be for those in whose behalf all act to decide whether the executive department of the government in the step which have take on this subject have be find in the line of duty the accompanying report of the secretary of war with the document annex to exhibit the operation of for the|past|year and the condition of the various subject intrust to administration will be see from that the army maintain the character have heretofore acquire for efficiency and military knowledge nothing have occur since last session to require service beyond the ordinary routine duty which upon the sea board and the in land frontier devolve upon in a time of peace the system so wisely adopt and so long pursued of construct fortification at expose point and of prepare and collect the supply necessary for the military defense of the country and thus providently furnish in peace the mean of defense in war have be continue with the usual result recommend to consideration the various subject suggest in the report of the secretary of war adoption would promote the public service and meliorate the condition of the army relation with the various indian tribe have be undisturbed since the termination of the difficulty grow out of the hostile aggression of the sac and fox|indians several treaty have be form for the relinquishment of territory to the|united|state and for the migration of the occupant of the region assign for residence west of the mississippi should these treaty be ratify by the senate provision will have be make for the removal of almost all the tribe remain e of that river and for the termination of many difficult and embarrassing question arise out of anomalous political condition be to be hope that those portion of of the southern tribe which in that event will present the only remain difficulty will realize the necessity of emigration and will speedily resort to original conviction upon this subject have be confirm by the course of event for several|year and experience be every|day add to strength that those tribe can not exist surround by settlement and in continual contact with citizen be certain have neither the intelligence the industry the moral habit nor the desire of improvement which be essential to any favorable change in condition establish in the midst of another and a superior race and without appreciate the cause of inferiority or seek to control must necessarily yield to the force of circumstance and ere long disappear such have be fate heretofore and if be to be avert and be can only be do by a general removal beyond boundary and by the reorganization of political system upon principle adapt to the new relation in which will be place the experiment which have be recently make have so far prove successful the emigrant generally be represent to be prosperous and contented the country suitable to want and habit and the essential article of subsistence easily procure when the report of the commissioner now engage in investigate the condition and prospect of these indians and in devise a plan for intercourse and government be receive trust ample mean of information will be in possession of the government for adjust all the unsettled question connect with this interesting subject the operation of the navy during the|year and present condition be fully exhibit in the annual report from the|navy|department suggestion be make by the secretary of various improvement which deserve careful consideration and most of which if adopt bid fair to promote the efficiency of this important branch of the public service among these be the new organization of the|navy|board the revision of the pay to officer and a change in the period of time or in the manner of make the annual appropriation to which beg leave to call particular attention the view which be present on almost every portion of naval concern and especially on the amount of force and the number of officer and the general course of policy appropriate in the present state of country for secure the great and useful purpose of naval protection in peace and due preparation for the contingency of war meet with entire approbation will be perceive from the report refer to that the fiscal concern of the establishment be in an excellent condition and be hope that congress may feel disposed to make promptly every suitable provision desire either for preserve or improve the system the general post|office|department have continue upon the strength of own resource to facilitate the mean of communication between the various portion of the union with increase activity the method however in which the account of the transportation of the mail have always be keep appear to have present an imperfect view of expense have recently be discover that from the early record of the department the annual statement have be calculate to exhibit an amount considerably short of the actual expense incur for that service these illusory statement together with the expense of carry into effect the law of the last session of congress establish new mail route and a disposition on the part of the head of the department to gratify the wish of the public in the extension of mail facility have induce to incur responsibility for improvement beyond what the current resource of the department would sustain as soon as have discover the imperfection of the method cause an investigation to be make of result and apply the proper remedy to correct the evil become necessary for to withdraw some of the improvement which have make to bring the expense of the department within own resource these expense be incur for the public good and the public have enjoy benefit be now but partially suspend and that where may be discontinue with the least inconvenience to the country the progressive increase in the income from postage have equal the high expectation and afford demonstrative evidence of the grow importance and great utility of this department the detail be exhibit in the accompanying report of the|postmaster|general the many distress accident which have of late occur in that portion of navigation carry on by the use of steam power deserve the immediate and unremitting attention of the constitute authority of the country the fact that the number of those fatal disaster be constantly increase not withstand the great improvement which be every where make in the machinery employ and in the rapid advance which have make in that branch of science show very clearly that be in a great degree the result of criminal negligence on the part of those by whom the vessel be navigate and to whose care and attention the life and property of citizen be so extensively intrusted that these evil may be greatly lessen if not substantially remove by mean of precautionary and penal legislation seem to be highly probably so far therefore as the subject can be regard as within the constitutional purview of congress earnestly recommend to prompt and serious consideration would also call attention to the view have heretofore express of the propriety of amend the constitution in relation to the mode of elect the president and the vice president of the|united|state regard as all important to the future quiet and harmony of the people that every intermediate agency in the election of these officer should be remove and that eligibility should be limit to term of either or year can not too earnestly invite consideration of the subject trust that deliberation on all the topic of general interest to which have advert and such other as more extensive knowledge of the want of beloved country may suggest may be crown with success tender in conclusion the cooperation which may be in power to afford transcript have carefully and anxiously consider all the fact and argument which have be submit to relative to a removal of the public deposit from the|bank|of|the|united|states the president deem duty to communicate in this manner to cabinet the final conclusion of own mind and the reason on which be found in order to put in durable form and to prevent misconception the president 's conviction of the dangerous tendency of the|bank|of|the|united|state since signally illustrate by own act be so overpower when enter on the duty of chief magistrate that feel duty notwithstanding the objection of the friend by whom be surround to avail of the first occasion to call the attention of congress and the people to the question of recharter the opinion express in annual message of december,|1829 be reiterate in those of december and and in that of throw out for consideration some suggestion in relation to a substitute at the session of an act be pass by a majority of both houses of congress rechartere the present bank upon which the president feel duty to put constitutional veto in message return that act repeat and enlarge upon the principle and view briefly assert in annual message declare the bank to be in opinion both inexpedient and unconstitutional and announce to countryman very unequivocally firm determination never to sanction by approval the continuance of that institution or the establishment of any other upon similar principle there be strong reason for believe that the motive of the bank in ask for a recharter at that session of congress be to make a lead question in the election of a president of the|united|state the ensue november and all step deem necessary be take to procure from the people a reversal of the president 's decision although the charter be approach termination and the bank be aware that be the intention of the government to use the public deposit as fast as have accrue in the payment of the public debt yet do extend loan from january,|1831 to may,|1832 from be an increase of in sixteen|months be confidently believe that the lead object of this immense extension of loan be to bring as large a portion of the people as possible under power and influence and have be disclose that some of the large sum be grant on very unusual term to the conductor of the public press in some of these case the motive be make manifest by the nominal or insufficient security take for the loan by the large amount discount by the extraordinary time allow for payment and especially by the subsequent conduct of those receive the accommodation have take these preliminary step to obtain control over public opinion the bank come into congress and ask a new charter the object avow by many of the advocate of the bank be to put the president to the test that the country may know final determination relative to the bank prior to the ensue election many document and article be print and circulate at the expense of the bank to bring the people to a favorable decision upon pretension those whom the bank appear to have make debtor for the special occasion be warn of the ruin which await should the president be sustain and attempt be make to alarm the whole people by paint the depression in the price of property and produce and the general loss inconvenience and distress which be represent would immediately follow the reelection of the president in opposition to the bank can now be say that the question of a recharter of the bank be not decide at the election which ensue have the veto be equivocal or have not cover the whole ground if have merely take exception to the detail of the bill or to the time of passage if have not meet the whole ground of constitutionality and expediency then there may have be some plausibility for the allegation that the question be not decide by the people be to compel the president to take stand that the question be bring forward at that particular time meet the challenge willingly take the position into which adversary seek to force and frankly declare unalterable opposition to the bank as be both unconstitutional and inexpedient on that ground the case be argue to the people and now that the people have sustain the president notwithstanding the array of influence and power which be bring to bear upon be too late confidently think to say that the question have not be decide whatever may be the opinion of other the president consider reelection as a decision of the people against the bank in the concluding paragraph of veto message say have now do duty to country if sustain by fellow citizen shall be grateful and happy if not shall find in the motif which impel ample ground for contentment and peace be sustain by a just people and desire to evince gratitude by carry into effect decision so far as depend upon of all the substitute for the present bank which have be suggest none seem to have unite any considerable portion of the public in favor most of be liable to the same constitutional objection for which the present bank have be condemn and perhaps to all there be strong objection on the score of expediency in rid the country of an irresponsible power which have attempt to control the government care must be take not to unite the same power with the executive branch to give a president the control over the currency and the power over individual now possess by the|bank|of|the|united|state even with the material difference that be responsible to the people would be as objectionable and as dangerous as to leave as be neither nor the other be necessary and therefore ought not to be resort to on the whole the president consider as conclusively settle that the charter of the|bank|of|the|united|state will not be renew and have no reasonable ground to believe that any substitute will be establish be bind to regulate course by the law as exist and not to anticipate the interference of the legislative power for the purpose of frame new system be proper for seasonably to consider the mean by which the service render by the|bank|of|the|united|state be to be perform after charter shall expire the exist law declare the deposit of the money of the|united|state in place in which the say bank and branch thereof may be establish shall be make in say bank or branch thereof unless the secretary of the treasury shall at any time otherwise order and direct in which case the secretary of the treasury shall immediately lay before congress if in session and if not immediately after the commencement of the next session the reason of such order or direction the power of the secretary of the treasury over the deposit be unqualified the provision that shall report reason to congress be no limitation have not be insert would have be responsible to congress have make a removal for any other than good reason and responsibility now cease upon the rendition of sufficient one to congress the only object of the provision be to make reason accessible to congress and enable that body the more readily to judge of soundness and purity and thereupon to make such further provision by law as the legislative power may think proper in relation to the deposit of the public money those reason may be very diversified be assert by the secretary of the treasury without contradiction as|early|as|1817 that have power to control the proceeding of the|bank|of|the|united|state at any moment by change the deposit to the state bank should pursue an illiberal course toward those institution that the secretary of the treasury will always be dispose to support the credit of the state bank and will invariably direct transfer from the deposit of the public money in aid of legitimate exertion to maintain credit and assert a right to employ the state bank when the|bank|of|the|united|state should refuse to receive on deposit the note of such state bank as the public interest require should be receive in payment of the public due in several instance do transfer the public deposit to state bank in the immediate vicinity of branch for reason connect only with the safety of those bank the public convenience and the interest of the treasury if be lawful for mr. crawford the secretary of the treasury at that time to act on these principle will be difficult to discover any sound reason against the application of similar principle in still strong case and be a matter of surprise that a power which in the infancy of the bank be freely assert as of the ordinary and familiar duty of the secretary of the treasury should now be gravely question and attempt make to excite and alarm the public mind as if some new and unheard of power be about to be usurp by the executive branch of the government be but a|little|more|than|two|and|a|half|years to the termination of the charter of the present bank be consider as the decision of the country that shall then cease to exist and no man the president believe have reasonable ground for expectation that any other bank|of|the|united|state will be create by congress to the|treasury|department be intrust the safe keep and faithful application of the public money a plan of collection different from the present must therefore be introduce and put in complete operation before the dissolution of the present bank when shall be commence shall no step be take in this essential concern until the charter expire and the treasury find without an agent account in confusion with no depository for fund and the whole business of the government derange or shall be delay until six|month or a|year or two|year before the expiration of the charter be obvious that any new system which may be substitute in the place of the|bank|of|the|united|state could not be suddenly carry into effect on the termination of existence without serious inconvenience to the government and the people vast amount of note be then to be redeem and withdraw from circulation and immense debt collect these operation must be gradual otherwise much suffering and distress will be bring upon the community ought to be not a work of month only but of year and the president think can not with due attention to the interest of the people be longer postpone be safe to begin too soon than to delay too long be for the wisdom of congress to decide upon the good substitute to be adopt in the place of the|bank|of|the|united|state and the president would have feel relieve from a heavy and painful responsibility if in the charter to the bank congress have reserve to the power of direct at pleasure the public money to be elsewhere deposit and have not devolve that power exclusively on of the|executive|department be useless now to inquire why this high and important power be surrender by those who be peculiarly and appropriately the guardian of the public money perhaps be an oversight but as the president presume that the charter to the bank be to be consider as a contract on the part of the government be not now in the power of congress to disregard stipulation and by the term of that contract the public money be to be deposit in the bank during the continuance of charter unless the secretary of the treasury shall otherwise direct unless therefore the secretary of the treasury first act congress have no power over the subject for can not add a new clause to the charter or strike out of without the consent of the bank and consequently the public money must remain in that institution to the|last|hour of existence unless the secretary of the treasury shall remove at an early day the responsibility be thus throw upon the executive branch of the government of decide how long before the expiration of the charter the public interest will require the deposit to be place elsewhere and although accord to the frame and principle of government this decision would seem more properly to belong to the legislative power yet as the law have impose upon the executive department the duty ought to be faithfully and firmly meet and the decision make and execute upon the good light that can be obtain and the good judgment that can be form would ill become the executive branch of the government to shrink from any duty which the law impose on to fix upon other the responsibility which justly belong to and while the president anxiously wish to abstain from the exercise of doubtful power and to avoid all interference with the right and duty of other must yet with unshaken constancy discharge own obligation and can not allow to turn aside in order to avoid any responsibility which the high trust with which have be honor require to encounter and be the duty of of the|executive|department to decide in the first instance subject to the future action of the legislative power whether the public deposit shall remain in the|bank|of|the|united|state until the end of existence or be withdraw some time before the president have feel bind to examine the question carefully and deliberately in order to make up judgment on the subject and in opinion the near approach of the termination of the charter and the public consideration heretofore mention be of amply sufficient to justify the removal of the deposit without reference to the conduct of the bank or safety in keeping but in the conduct of the bank may be find other reason very imperative in character and which require prompt action development have be make from time to time of faithlessness as a public agent misapplication of public fund interference in election effort by the machinery of committee to deprive the government director of a full knowledge of concern and above all flagrant misconduct as recently and unexpectedly disclose in place all the fund of the bank include the money of the government at the disposition of the president of the bank as mean of operate upon public opinion and procure a new charter without require to render a voucher for disbursement a brief recapitulation of the fact which justify these charge and which have come to the knowledge of the public and the president will think remove every reasonable doubt as to the course which be now the duty of the president to pursue have see that in sixteen|months|ending|in|may,|1832 the bank have extend loan more|than|$28,000,000 although know the government intend to appropriate most of large deposit during that|year in payment of the public debt be in may,|1832 that loan arrive at the maximum and in the|preceding|march so sensible be the bank that would not be able to pay over the public deposit when would be require by the government that commence a secret negotiation without the approbation or knowledge of the government with the agent for about|$2,700,000 of the stock hold in holland with a view of induce not to come forward for payment for one|or|more|years after notice should be give by the|treasury|department this arrangement would have enable the bank to keep and use during that time the public money set apart for the payment of these stock after this negotiation have commence the secretary of the treasury inform the bank that be intention to pay off half of the percent on the|1st of the succeed july which amount to about|$6,500,000 the president of the bank although the committee of investigation be then look into affair at philadelphia come immediately to washington and upon represent that the bank be desirous of accommodate the import merchant at new|york which fail to do and undertake to pay the interest procure the consent of the secretary after consultation with the president to postpone the payment until the succeed 1st of october conscious that at the|end|of|that|quarter the bank would not be able to pay over the deposit and that further indulgence be not to be expect of the government an agent be dispatch to england secretly to negotiate with the holder of the public debt in europe and induce by the offer of an equal or high interest than that pay by the government to hold back claim for one|year during which the bank expect thus to retain the use of of the public money which the government should set apart for the payment of that debt the agent make an arrangement on term in part which be in direct violation of the charter of the bank and when some incident connect with this secret negotiation accidentally come to the knowledge of the public and the government then and not before so much of as be palpably in violation of the charter be disavow a modification of the rest be attempt with the view of get the certificate without payment of the money and thus absolve the government from liability to the holder in this scheme the bank be partially successful but to this day the certificate of a portion of these stock have not be pay and the bank retain the use of the money this effort to thwart the government in the payment of the public debt that may retain the public money to be use for private interest palliate by pretense notoriously unfounded and insincere would have justify the instant withdrawal of the public deposit the negotiation render doubtful the ability of the bank to meet the demand of the treasury and the misrepresentation by which be attempt to be justify prove that no reliance could be place upon allegation if the question of a removal of the deposit present to the executive in the same attitude that appear before the|house|of|representatives at last session resolution in relation to the safety of the deposit would be entitle to more weight although the decision of the question of removal have be confide by law to another department of the government but the question now occur attend by other circumstance and new disclosure of the most serious import be true that in the message of the president which produce this inquiry and resolution on the part of the|house|of|representatives be object to obtain the aid of that body in make a thorough examination into the conduct and condition of the bank and branch in order to enable the executive department to decide whether the public money be longer safe in hand the limited power of the secretary of the treasury over the subject disable from make the investigation as fully and satisfactorily as could be do by a committee of the|house|of|representatives and hence the president desire the assistance of congress to obtain for the|treasury|department a full knowledge of all the fact which be necessary to guide judgment but be not purpose as the language of message will show to ask the representative of the people to assume a responsibility which do not belong to and relieve the executive branch of the government from the duty which the law have impose upon be due to the president that object in that proceeding should be distinctly understand and that should acquit of all suspicion of seek to escape from the performance of own duty or of desire to interpose another body between and the people in order to avoid a measure which be call upon to meet but although as an act of justice to disclaim any design of solicit the opinion of the|house|of|representatives in relation to own duty in order to shelter from responsibility under the sanction of counsel yet be at all time ready to listen to the suggestion of the representative of the people whether give voluntarily or upon solicitation and to consider with the profound respect to which all will admit that be justly entitle whatever may be the consequence however to must finally form own judgment where the constitution and the law make duty to decide and must act accordingly and be bind to suppose that such a course on part will never be regard by that elevated body as a mark of disrespect to but that will on the contrary esteem the strong evidence can give of fix resolution conscientiously to discharge duty to and the country a new state of thing have however arise since the close of the last session of congress and evidence have since be lay before the president which be persuade would have lead the|house|of|representatives to a different conclusion if have come to knowledge the fact that the bank control and in some case substantially own and by money support some of the lead press of the country be now more clearly establish editor to whom loan extravagant sum in and on unusual time and nominal security have since turn out to be insolvent and to other apparently in no well condition accommodation still more extravagant on term more unusual and some without any security have also be heedlessly grant the allegation which have so often circulate through these channel that the treasury be bankrupt and the bank be sustain when for many|year there have not be less on an average,|than|six|million of public money in that institution may be pass over as a harmless misrepresentation but when be attempt by substantial act to impair the credit of the government and tarnish the honor of the country such charge require more serious attention with six|million of public money in vault after have have the use of from five|to|twelve|million for nine|year without interest become the purchaser of a bill draw by government on that of france for be the first installment of the french indemnity the purchase money be leave in the use of the bank be simply add to the treasury deposit the bank sell the bill in england and the holder send to france for collection and arrangement not have be make by the|french|government for payment be take up by the agent of the bank in paris with the fund of the bank in hand under these circumstance have through organ openly assail the credit of the government and have actually make and persist in a demand of or as damage when no damage or none beyond some trifling expense have in fact be sustain and when the bank have in own possession on deposit several|million of the public money which be then use for own profit be a fiscal agent of the government which thus seek to enrich at the expense of the public worthy of further trust there be other important fact not in the contemplation of the|house|of|representatives or not know to the member at the time vote for the resolution although the charter and the rule of the bank both declare that not less|than|seven director shall be necessary to the transaction of business yet the most important business even that of grant discount to any extent be intrust to a committee of member who do not report to the board to cut off all mean of communication with the government in relation to most important act at the commencement of the|present|year not of the government director be place on any committee and although since by an unusual remodeling of those body some of those director have be place on some of the committee be yet entirely exclude from the committee of exchange through which the great and most objectionable loan have be make when the government director make an effort to bring back the business of the bank to the board in obedience to the charter and the exist regulation the board not only overrule attempt but alter the rule so as to make conform to the practice in direct violation of of the most important provision of the charter which give existence have long be know that the president of the bank by single will originate and execute many of the most important measure connect with the management and credit of the bank and that the committee as well as the board of director be leave in entire ignorance of many act do and correspondence carry on in name and apparently under authority the fact have be recently disclose that an unlimited discretion have be and be now vest in the president of the bank to expend fund in payment for prepare and circulate article and purchase pamphlet and newspaper calculate by content to operate on election and secure a renewal of charter appear from the official report of the public director that on the|30th|november,|1830 the president submit to the board an article publish in the american quarterly review contain favorable notice of the bank and suggest the expediency of give a wide circulation at the expense of the bank whereupon the board pass the follow resolution viz resolve that the president be authorize to take such measure in regard to the circulation of the content of the say article either in whole or in part as may deem most for the interest of the bank by an entry in the minute of the bank date march|11,|1831 appear that the president have not only cause a large edition of that article to be issue but have also before the resolution of 30th november be adopt procure to be print and widely circulate numerous copy of the report of general smith and mr. mcduffie in favor of the bank and on that|day suggest the expediency of extend power to the printing of other article which may subserve the purpose of the institution whereupon the follow resolution be adopt viz resolve that the president be hereby authorize to cause to be prepare and circulate such document and paper as may communicate to the people information in regard to the nature and operation of the bank the expenditure purport to have be make under authority of these resolution during the|years|1831|and|1832 be for a portion of these expenditure voucher be render from which appear that be incur in the purchase of some|hundred|thousand copy of newspaper report and speech make in congress review of the veto message and review of speech against the bank for another large portion no voucher whatever be render but the various sum be pay on order of the president of the bank make reference to the resolution of the|11th|of|march,|1831 on ascertain these fact and perceiving that expenditure of a similar character be still continue the government director a|few|weeks|ago offer a resolution in the board call for a specific account of these expenditure show the object to which have be apply and the person to whom the money have be pay this reasonable proposition be vote down also offer a resolution rescind the resolution of november,|1830 and march,|1831 this also be reject not content with thus refuse to recall the obnoxious power or even to require such an account of the expenditure as would show whether the money of the bank have in fact be apply to the object contemplate by these resolution as obnoxious as be the board renew the power already confer and even enjoin renew attention to exercise by adopt the following in lieu of the proposition submit by the government director viz resolve that the board have confidence in the wisdom and integrity of the president and in the propriety of the resolution of and and entertain a full conviction of the necessity of a renew attention to the object of those resolution and that the president be authorize and request to continue exertion for the promotion of say object take in connection with the nature of the expenditure heretofore make as recently disclose which the board not only tolerate but approve this resolution put the fund of the bank at the disposition of the president for the purpose of employ the whole press of the country in the service of the bank to hire writer and newspaper and to pay out such sum as please to what person and for what service please without the responsibility of render any specific account the bank be thus convert into a vast electioneer engine with mean to embroil the country in deadly feud and under cover of expenditure in improper extend corruption through all the ramification of society some of the item for which account have be render show the construction which have be give to the resolution and the way in which the power confer have be exert the money have not be expend merely in the publication and distribution of speech report of committee or article write for the purpose of show the constitutionality or usefulness of the bank but publication have be prepare and extensively circulate contain the grossest invective against the officer of the government and the money which belong to the stockholder and to the public have be freely apply in effort to degrade in public estimation those who be suppose to be instrumental in resist the wish of this gasping and dangerous institution as the president of the bank have not be require to settle account no one but know how much more than the sum already mention may have be squander and for which a credit may hereafter be claim in account under this most extraordinary resolution with these fact before can be surprised at the torrent of abuse incessantly pour out against all who be suppose to stand in the way of the cupidity or ambition of the|bank|of|the|united|state can be surprised sudden and unexpected change of opinion in favor of an institution which have million to lavish and avow determination not to spare mean when be necessary to accomplish purpose the refusal to render an account of the manner in which a part of the money expend have be apply give just cause for the suspicion that have be use for purpose which be not deem prudent to expose to the eye of an intelligent and virtuous people those who act justly do not shun the light nor do refuse explanation when the propriety of conduct be bring into question with these fact before in an official report from the government director the president would feel that be not only responsible for all the abuse and corruption the bank have commit or may commit but almost an accomplice in a conspiracy against that government which have swear honestly to administer if do not take every step within constitutional and legal power likely to be efficient in put an end to these enormity if be possible within the scope of human affair to find a reason for remove the government deposit and leave the bank to own resource for the mean of effect criminal design have here be expect when the money of the|united|state be direct to be place in that bank that would be put under the control of man empower to spend million without render a voucher or specify the object can be consider safe with the evidence before that tens|of|thousand have be spend for highly improper if not corrupt purpose and that the same motive may lead to the expenditure of hundreds|of|thousands and even million more and can justify to the people by long lend to the money and power of the government to be employ for such purpose have be allege by some as an objection to the removal of the deposit that the bank have the power and in that event will have the disposition to destroy the state bank employ by the government and bring distress upon the country have be the fortune of the president to encounter danger which be represent as equally alarming and have see vanish before resolution and energy picture equally appal be parade before when this bank come to demand a new charter but what be the result have the country be ruin or even distressed be ever more prosperous than since that act the president verily believe the bank have not the power to produce the calamity friend threaten the fund of the government will not be annihilate by be transfer will immediately be issue for the benefit of trade and if the|bank|of|the|united|state curtail loan the state bank strengthen by the public deposit will extend what come in through bank will go out through other and the equilibrium will be preserve should the bank for the mere purpose of produce distress press debtor more heavily than some of can bear the consequence will recoil upon and in the attempt to embarrass the country will only bring loss and ruin upon the holder of own stock but if the president believe the bank possess all the power which have be attribute to determination would only be render the more inflexible if indeed this corporation now hold in hand the happiness and prosperity of the american people be high time to take the alarm if the despotism be already upon and only safety be in the mercy of the despot recent development in relation to design and the mean employ show how necessary be to shake off the struggle can never come with less distress to the people or under more favorable auspex than at the present moment all doubt as to the willingness of the state bank to undertake the service of the government to the same extent and on the same term as be now perform by the|bank|of|the|united|states be put to rest by the report of the agent recently employ to collect information and from that willingness own safety in the operation may be confidently infer know own resource better than can be know by other be not to be suppose that would be willing to place in a situation which can not occupy without danger of annihilation or embarrassment the only consideration apply to the safety of the public fund if deposit in those institution and when be see that the director of many of be not only willing to pledge the character and capital of the corporation in give success to this measure but also own property and reputation can not doubt that at least believe the public deposit would be safe in management the president think that these fact and circumstance afford as strong a guaranty as can be have in human affair for the safety of the public fund and the practicability of a new system of collection and disbursement through the agency of the state bank from all these consideration the president think that the state bank ought immediately to be employ in the collection and disbursement of the public revenue and the fund now in the|bank|of|the|united|state draw out with all convenient dispatch the safety of the public money if deposit in the state bank must be secure beyond all reasonable doubt but the extent and nature of the security in addition to capital if any be deem necessary be a subject of detail to which the|treasury|department will undoubtedly give anxious attention the bank to be employ must remit the money of the government without charge as the|bank|of|the|united|state now do must render all the service which that bank now perform must keep the government advise of situation by periodical return in fine in any arrangement with the state bank the government must not in any respect be place on a bad footing than now be the president be happy to perceive by the report of the agent that the bank which have consult have in general consent to perform the service on these term and that those in new|york have further agree to make payment in london without other charge than the mere cost of the bill of exchange should also be enjoin upon any bank which may be employ that will be expect of to facilitate domestic exchange for the benefit of internal commerce to grant all reasonable facility to the payer of the revenue to exercise the utmost liberality toward the other state bank and do nothing uselessly to embarrass the|bank|of|the|united|state as of the most serious objection to the|bank|of|the|united|states be the power which concentrate care must be take in find other agent for the service of the treasury not to raise up another power equally formidable although would probably be impossible to produce such a result by any organization of the state bank which could be devise yet be desirable to avoid even the appearance to this end would be expedient to assume no more power over and interfere no more in affair than may be absolutely necessary to the security of the public deposit and the faithful performance of duty as agent of the treasury any interference by in the political contest of the country with a view to influence election ought in the opinion of the president to be follow by an immediate discharge from the public service be the desire of the president that the control of the bank and the currency shall as far as possible be entirely separate from the political power of the country as well as wrest from an institution which have already attempt to subject the government to will in opinion the action of the|general|government on this subject ought not to extend beyond the grant in the constitution which only authorize congress to coin money and regulate the value thereof all else belong to the states and the people and must be regulate by public opinion and the interest of trade in conclusion the president must be permit to remark that look upon the pende question as of high consideration than the mere transfer of a sum of money from bank to another decision may affect the character of government for age to come should the bank be suffer longer to use the public money in the accomplishment of purpose with the proof of faithlessness and corruption before eye the patriotic among citizen will despair of success in struggle against power and shall be responsible for entail upon country forever view as a question of transcendent importance both in the principle and consequence involve the president could not in justice to the responsibility which owe to the country refrain from press upon the secretary of the treasury view of the consideration which impel to immediate action upon have be devolve by the constitution and the suffrage of the american people the duty of superintend the operation of the|executive|departments|of|the|government and see that the law be faithfully execute in the performance of this high trust be undoubted right to express to those whom the law and own choice have make associate in the administration of the government opinion of duty under circumstance as arise be this right which now

revenue law in a particular quarter of the|united|state which threaten not merely to thwart execution but to endanger the integrity of the union and although then express reliance that may be overcome by the prudence of the officer of the|united|state and the patriotism of the people state that should the emergency arise render the execution of the exist law impracticable from any cause whatever prompt notice should be give to congress with the suggestion of such view and measure as may be necessary to meet event which have occur in the|quarter then allude to or which have come to knowledge subsequently present this emergency since the date of last annual message have have officially transmit to by the governor of south|carolina which now communicate to congress a copy of the ordinance pass by the convention which assemble at columbia in the|state|of|south|carolina in november last declare certain act of congress therein mention within the limit of that state to be absolutely null and void and make the duty of the legislature to pass such law as would be necessary to carry the same into effect from and after the|1st|february next the consequence to which this extraordinary defiance of the just authority of the government may too surely lead be clearly foresee and be impossible for to hesitate as to own duty in such an emergency the ordinance have be pass however without any certain knowledge of the recommendation which from a view of the interest of the nation at large the executive have determine to submit to congress and a hope be indulge that by frankly explain sentiment and the nature of those duty which the crisis would devolve upon the authority of south|carolina may be induce to retrace step in this hope determine to issue proclamation of the|10th|of|december|last a copy of which now lie before congress regret to inform that these reasonable expectation have not be realize and that the several act of the legislature of south|carolina which now lay before and which have all and each of finally pass after a knowledge of the desire of the administration to modify the law complain of be too well calculate both in positive enactment and in the spirit of opposition which obviously encourage wholly to obstruct the collection of the revenue within the limit of that state up to this period neither the recommendation of the executive in regard to financial policy and impost system nor the disposition manifest by congress promptly to act upon that subject nor the unequivocal expression of the public will in all part of the union appear to have produce any relaxation in the measure of opposition adopt by the|state|of|south|carolina nor be there any reason to hope that the ordinance and law will be abandon have no knowledge that an attempt have be make or that be in contemplation to reassemble either the convention or the legislature and will be perceive that the interval before the|1st|of|february be too short to admit of the preliminary step necessary for that purpose appear moreover that the state authority be actively organize military resource and provide the mean and give the most solemn assurance of protection and support to all who shall enlist in opposition to the revenue law a recent proclamation of the present governor of south|carolina have openly defy the authority of the|executive|of|the|union and general order from the headquarters of the state announce determination to accept the service of volunteer and belief that should country need service will be find at the post of honor and duty ready to lay down life in defense under these order the force refer to be direct to hold in readiness to take the field at a moment 's warning and in the city of charleston within a collection district and a port of entry a rendezvous have be open for the purpose of enlist man for the magazine and municipal guard thus south|carolina present in the attitude of hostile preparation and ready even for military violence if nee be to enforce law for prevent the collection of the duty within limit proceeding thus announce and matured must be distinguish from menace of unlawful resistance by irregular body of people who act under temporary delusion may be restrain by reflection and the influence of public opinion from the commission of actual outrage in the present instance aggression may be regard as commit when be officially authorize and the mean of enforce fully provide under these circumstance there can be no doubt that be the determination of the authority of fully to carry into effect ordinance and law after the|1st|of|february therefore become duty to bring the subject to the serious consideration of congress in order that such measure as in wisdom may deem fit shall be seasonably provide and that may be thereby understand that while the government be dispose to remove all just cause of complaint as far as may be practicable consistently with a proper regard to the interest of the community at large be nevertheless determine that the supremacy of the law shall be maintain in make this communication appear to to be proper not only that should lay before the act and proceeding of south|carolina but that should also fully acquaint with those step which have already cause to be take for the due collection of the revenue and with view of the subject generally that the suggestion which the constitution require to make in regard to future legislation may be better understand this subject have early attract the anxious attention of the executive as soon as be probable that the authority of south|carolina seriously meditate resistance to the faithful execution of the revenue law be deem advisable that the secretary of the treasury should particularly instruct the officer of the|united|state in that part of the union as to the nature of the duty prescribe by the exist law instruction be accordingly issue on the|6th|of|november to the collector in that state point out respective duty and enjoin upon each a firm and vigilant but discreet performance of in the emergency then apprehend herewith transmit copy of these instruction and of the letter address to the district attorney request cooperation these instruction be dictate in the hope that as the opposition to the law by the anomalous proceeding of nullification be represent to be of a pacific nature to be pursue substantially accord to the form of the constitution and without resort in any event to force or violence the measure of advocate would be take in conformity with that profession and on such supposition the mean afford by the exist law would have be adequate to meet any emergency likely to arise be however not possible altogether to suppress apprehension of the excess to which the excitement prevail in that|quarter may lead but certainly be not foresee that the meditate obstruction to the law would so soon openly assume present character subsequently to the date of those instruction however the ordinance of the convention be pass which if comply with by the people of the state must effectually render inoperative the present revenue law within limit that ordinance declare and that the several act and part of act of the|congress|of|the|united|state purport to be law for the imposing of duty and impost on the importation of foreign commodity and now

be strict compatibility with constitutional obligation to all law pass by the|general|government within the authorize grant of power to be draw in question when this interposition be exert in a case in which the compact have be palpably deliberately and dangerously violate that bring up a conjuncture of deep and momentous interest be neither to be conceal nor deny this crisis present a class of

believe that other act have be pass embrace provision for enforce the ordinance but have not yet be able to procure transmit however a copy of governor hamilton 's message to the legislature of south|carolina of governor hayne 's inaugural address to the same body as also of proclamation and a general order of the governor and commander in chief date the|20th|of|december give public notice that the service of volunteer will be accept under the act already refer to if these measure can not be defeat and overcome by the power confer by the constitution must be consider as incompetent to own defense the supremacy of the law be at an end and the right and liberty of the citizen can no longer receive protection from the|government|of|the|union not only abrogate the act of congress commonly call the tariff act of and but prostrate and sweep away at once and without exception every act and every part of every act impose any amount whatever of duty on any foreign merchandise and virtually every existing act which have ever be pass authorize the collection of the revenue include the act of and also the collection law of the constitutionality of which have never be question be not only those duty which be charge to have be impose for the protection of manufacture that be thereby repeal but all other though lay for the purpose of revenue merely and upon article in no degree suspect of be object of protection the whole revenue system of the|united|state in south|carolina be obstruct and overthrow and the government be absolutely prohibit from collect any part of the public revenue within the limit of that state henceforth not only the citizen of south|carolina and of the|united|state but the subject of foreign state may import any description or quantity of merchandise into the port of south|carolina without the payment of any duty whatsoever that state be thus relieve from the payment of any part of the public burthen and duty and impost be not only render not uniform throughout the|united|state but a direct and ruinous preference be give to the port of that state over those of all the other states of the union in manifest violation of the positive provision of the constitution in point of duration also those aggression upon the authority of congress which by the ordinance be make part of the fundamental law of south|carolina be absolute indefinite and without limitation neither prescribe the period when shall cease nor indicate any condition upon which those who have thus undertake to arrest the operation of the law be to retrace step and rescind measure offer to the|united|states no alternative but unconditional submission if the scope of the ordinance be to be receive as the scale of concession demand can be satisfied only by a repeal of the whole system of revenue law and by abstain from the collection of any duty and impost whatsoever be true that in the address to the people of the|united|state by the convention of south|carolina after announce the fixed and final determination of the state in relation to the protect system say that remain for to submit a plan of taxation in which would be willing to acquiesce in a liberal spirit of concession provide be meet in due time and in a become spirit by the states interested in manufacture in the opinion of the convention an equitable plan would be that the whole list of protect article should be import free of all duty and that the revenue derive from import duty should be raise exclusively from the unprotected article or that whenever a duty be impose upon protect article import an excise duty of the same rate shall be impose upon all similar article manufacture in the|united|state the address proceed to state however that be willing to make a large offering to preserve the union and with a distinct declaration that be a concession on part will consent that the same rate of duty may be impose upon the protect article that shall be impose upon the unprotected provide that no more revenue be raise than be necessary to meet the demand of the government for constitutional purpose and provide also that a duty substantially uniform be impose upon all foreign import be also true that in message to the legislature when urge the necessity of provide mean of secure safety by ample resource for repel force by force the governor of south|carolina observe that can not but think that on a calm and dispassionate review by congress and the functionary of the|general|government of the true merit of this controversy the arbitration by a call of a convention of all the states which sincerely and anxiously seek and desire will be accord to from the diversity of term indicate in these important document take in connection with the progress of recent event in that|quarter there be too much reason to apprehend without in any manner doubt the intention of those public functionary that neither the term propose in the address of the convention nor those allude to in the message of the governor would appease the excitement which have lead to the present excess be obvious however that should the latter be insist on present an alternative which the|general|government of can by no possibility grant since by an express provision of the constitution congress can call a convention for the purpose of propose amendment only on the application of the legislature of third of the states and be not perceive that the term present in the address be more practicable than those refer to in the message will not escape attention that the condition on which be say in the address of the convention would be willing to acquiesce form no part of the ordinance while this ordinance bear all the solemnity of a fundamental law be to be authoritative upon all within the limit of south|carolina and be absolute and unconditional in term the address convey only the sentiment of the convention in no binding or practical form be the act of the state the other only the expression of the opinion of the member of the convention to limit the effect of that solemn act by any term or condition whatever should have be embody in and make of import no less authoritative than the act by the positive enactment of the ordinance the execution of the law of the union be absolutely prohibit and the address offer no other prospect of be again restore even in the modify form propose than what depend upon the improbable contingency that amid change event and increase excitement the sentiment of the present member of the convention and of successor will remain the same be to be regret however that these condition even if have be offer in the same binding form be so undefined depend upon so many contingency and be so directly oppose to the know opinion and interest of the great body of the american people as to be almost hopeless of attainment the majority of the states and of the people will certainly not consent that the protect duty shall be wholly abrogate never to be reenact at any future time or in any possible contingency as little practicable be to provide that the same rate of duty shall be impose upon the protect article that shall be impose upon the unprotected which moreover would be severely oppressive to the poor and in time of war would add greatly to rigor and though there can be no objection to the principle properly understand that no more revenue shall be raise than be necessary for the constitutional purpose of the government which principle have be already recommend by the executive as the true basis of taxation yet be very certain that south|carolina alone can not be permit to decide what these constitutional purpose be the period which constitute the due time in which the term propose in the address be to be accept would seem to present scarcely less difficulty than the term though the revenue law be already declare to be void in south|carolina as well as the bond take under and the judicial proceeding for carry into effect yet as the full action and operation of the ordinance be to be suspend until the|1st|of|february the interval may be assume as the time within which be expect that the most complicated portion of the national legislation a system of long stand and affect great interest in the community be to be rescind and abolish if this be require be clear that a compliance be impossible in the uncertainty then that exist as to the duration of the ordinance and of the enactment for enforce become imperiously the duty of the executive of the|united|state act with a proper regard to all the great interest commit to care to treat those act as absolute and unlimited be so as far as agency be concern can not either embrace or lead to the performance of the condition have already discharge the only part in power by the recommendation in annual message the rest be with congress and the people and until have act duty will require to look to the exist state of thing and act under accord to high obligation by these various proceeding therefore the|state|of|south|carolina have force unavoidably to decide the new and dangerous alternative of permit a state to obstruct the execution of the law within limit or see attempt to execute a threat of withdraw from the union that portion of the people at present exercise the authority of the state solemnly assert right to do either and as solemnly announce determination to do or the other in opinion both purpose be to be regard as revolutionary in character and tendency and subversive of the supremacy of the law and of the integrity of the union the result of each be the same since a state in which by an usurpation of power the constitutional authority of the|federal|government be openly defy and set aside want only the form to be independent of the union the right of the people of a single state to absolve at will and without the consent of the other states from most solemn obligation and hazard the liberty and happiness of the million compose this union can not be acknowledge such authority be believe to be utterly repugnant both to the principle upon which the|general|government be constitute and to the object which be expressly form to attain against all act which may be allege to transcend the constitutional power of the government or which may be inconvenient or oppressive in operation the constitution have prescribe the mode of redress be the acknowledge attribute of free institution that under the empire of reason and law be substitute for the power of the sword to no other source can appeal for suppose wrong be make consistently with the obligation of south|carolina to no other can such appeal be make with safety at any time and to decision when constitutionally pronounce become the duty no less of the public authority than of the people in every case to yield a patriotic submission that a state or any other great portion of the people suffer under long and intolerable oppression and have try all constitutional remedy without the hope of redress may have a natural right when happiness can be no otherwise secure and when can do so without great injury to other to absolve from obligation to the government and appeal to the last resort need not on the present occasion be deny the existence of this right however must depend upon the cause which may justify exercise be the ultima ratio which presuppose that the proper appeal to all other mean of redress have be make in good faith and which can never be rightfully resort to unless be unavoidable be not the right of the state but of the individual and of all the individual in the state be the right of mankind generally to secure by all mean in power the blessing of liberty and happiness but when for these purpose any body of man have voluntarily associate under a particular form of government no portion of can dissolve the association without acknowledge the correlative right in the remainder to decide whether that dissolution can be permit consistently with the general happiness in this view be a right dependent upon the power to enforce such a right though may be admit to preexist and can not be wholly surrender be necessarily subject to limitation in all free government and in compact of all kind freely and voluntarily enter into and in which the interest and welfare of the individual become identify with those of the community of which be a member in compact between individual however deeply may affect relation these principle be acknowledge to create a sacred obligation and in compact of civil government involve the liberty and happiness of million of mankind the obligation can not be less without advert to the particular theory to which the federal compact have give rise both as to formation and the party to and without inquire whether be merely federal or social or national be sufficient that must be admit to be a compact and to possess the obligation incident to a compact to be a compact by which power be create on the hand and obedience exact on the other a compact freely voluntarily and solemnly enter into by the several states and ratify by the people thereof respectively a compact by which the several states and the people thereof respectively have bind to each other and to the|federal|government and by which the|federal|government be bind to the several states and to every citizen of the|united|state to this compact in whatever mode may have be do the people of south|carolina have freely and voluntarily give assent and to the whole and every part of be upon every principle of good faith inviolably bind under this obligation be bind and should be require to contribute portion of the public expense and to submit to all law make by the common consent in pursuance of the constitution for the common defense and general welfare until can be change in the mode which the compact have provide for the attainment of those great end of the government and of the union nothing less than cause which would justify revolutionary remedy can absolve the people from this obligation and for nothing less can the government permit to be do without violate own obligation by which under the compact be bind to the other states and to every citizen of the|united|state these deduction plainly flow from the nature of the federal compact which be of limitation not only upon the power originally possess by the party thereto but also upon those confer on the government and every department thereof will be freely concede that by the principle of system all power be vest in the people but to be exercise in the mode and subject to the check which the people have prescribe these check be undoubtedly only different modification of the same great popular principle which lie at the foundation of the whole but be not on that account to be less regard or less obligatory upon the power of congress the veto of the executive and the authority of the judiciary which be to extend to all case in law and equity arise under the constitution and law of the|united|state make in pursuance thereof be the obvious check and the sound action of public opinion with the ultimate power of amendment be the salutary and only limitation upon the power of the whole however may be allege that a violation of the compact by the measure of the government can affect the obligation of the party can not even be pretend that such violation can be predicate of those measure until all the constitutional remedy shall have be fully try if the|federal|government exercise power not warrant by the constitution and immediately affect individual will scarcely be deny that the proper remedy be a recourse to the judiciary such undoubtedly be the remedy for those who deem the act of congress lay duty and impost and provide for collection to be unconstitutional the whole operation of such law be upon the individual import the merchandise a state be absolutely prohibit from lay impost or duty on import or export without the consent of congress and can not become a party under these law without import in own name or wrongfully interpose authority against by thus interpose however can not rightfully obstruct the operation of the law upon individual for disobedience to or violation of the law the ordinary remedy through the judicial tribunal would remain and in a case where an individual should be prosecute for any offense against the law could not set up in justification of act a law of the state which be unconstitutional would therefore be regard as null and void the law of a state can not authorize the commission of a crime against the|united|state or any other act which accord to the supreme law of the union would be otherwise unlawful and be equally clear that if there be any case in which a state as such be affect by the law beyond the scope of judicial power the remedy consist in appeal to the people either to effect a change in the representation or to procure relief by an amendment of the constitution but the measure of the government be to be recognize as valid and consequently supreme until these remedy shall have be effectually try and any attempt to subvert those measure or to render the law subordinate to state authority and afterwards to resort to constitutional redress be bad than evasive would not be a proper resistance to a government of unlimited power as have be sometimes pretend but unlawful opposition to the very limitation on which the harmonious action of the government and all part absolutely depend have appeal to none of these remedy but in effect have defy all while threaten to separate from the union if any attempt be make to enforce the revenue law otherwise than through the civil tribunal of the country have not only not appeal in own name to those tribunal which the constitution have provide for all case in law or equity arise under the constitution and law of the|united|state but have endeavor to frustrate proper action on citizen by draw the cognizance of case under the revenue law to own tribunal specially prepare and fit for the purpose of enforce the act pass by the state to obstruct those law and both the judge and juror of which will be bind by the import of oath previously take to treat the constitution and law of the|united|state in this respect as a nullity nor have the state make the proper appeal to public opinion and to the remedy of amendment for without wait to learn whether the other states will consent to a convention or if do will construe or amend the constitution to suit view have of own authority alter the import of that instrument and give immediate effect to the change in fine have set own will and authority above the law have make arbiter in own cause and have pass at once over all intermediate step to measure of avowed resistance which unless be submit to can be enforce only by the sword in decide upon the course which a high sense of duty to all the people of the|united|state impose upon the authority of the union in this emergency can not be overlook that there be no sufficient cause for the act of south|carolina or for thus place in jeopardy the happiness of so|many|million of people misrule and oppression to warrant the disruption of the free institution of the|union|of|these|state should be great and lasting defy all other remedy for cause of minor character the government could not submit to such a catastrophe without a violation of most sacred obligation to the other states of the union who have submit destiny to hand there be in the present instance no such cause either in the degree of misrule or oppression complain of or in the hopelessness of redress by constitutional mean the long sanction have receive from the proper authority and from the people not less than the unexampled growth and increase prosperity of so|many|million of freeman attest that no such oppression as would justify or even palliate such a resort can be justly impute either to the present policy or past measure of the|federal|government the same mode of collect duty and for the same general object which begin with the foundation of the government and which have conduct the country through subsequent step to present enviable condition of happiness and renown have not be change taxation and representation the great principle of the|american|revolution have continually go hand in hand and at all time and in every instance no tax of any kind have be impose without participation and in some instance which have be complain of with the express assent of a part of the representative of south|carolina in the council of the government up to the present period no revenue have be raise beyond the necessary want of the country and the authorize expenditure of the government and as soon as the burthen of the public debt be remove those charge with the administration have promptly recommend a corresponding reduction of revenue that this system thus pursue have result in no such oppression upon south|carolina need no other proof than the solemn and official declaration of the late chief magistrate of that state in address to the legislature in that say the occurrence of the|past|year in connection with domestic concern be to be review with a sentiment of fervent gratitude to the|great|disposer|of|human|events that tribute of grateful acknowledgment be due for the various and multiply blessing have be pleased to bestow on people that abundant harvest in every quarter of the state have crown the exertion of agricultural labor that health almost beyond former precedent have bless home and that there be not less reason for thankfulness in survey social condition would indeed be difficult to imagine oppression where in the social condition of a people there be equal cause of thankfulness as for abundant harvest and varied and multiply blessing with which a kind providence have favor independently of these consideration will not escape observation that south|carolina still claim to be a component part of the union to participate in the national council and to share in the public benefit without contribute to the public burden thus assert the dangerous anomaly of continue in an association without acknowledge any other obligation to law than what depend upon own will in this posture of affair the duty of the government seem to be plain inculcate a recognition of that state as a member of the union and subject to authority a vindication of the just power of the constitution the preservation of the integrity of the union and the execution of the law by all constitutional mean the constitution which oath of office oblige to support declare that the executive shall take care that the law be faithfully execute and in provide that shall from time to time give to congress information of the state of the union and recommend to consideration such measure as shall judge necessary and expedient impose the additional obligation of recommend to congress such more efficient provision for execute the law as may from time to time be find requisite the same instrument confer on congress the power not merely to lay and collect taxis duty impost and excise to pay the debt and provide for the common defense and general welfare but to make all law which shall be necessary and proper for carry into effect the forego power and all other power vest by the constitution in the government of the|united|state or in any department or officer thereof and also to provide for call forth the militia for execute the law of the union in all case similar to the present the duty of the government become the measure of power and whenever fail to exercise a power necessary and proper to the discharge of the duty prescribe by the constitution violate the public trust not less than would in transcend proper limit to refrain therefore from the high and solemn duty thus enjoin however painful the performance may be and thereby tacitly permit the rightful authority of the government to be contemn and law obstruct by a single state would neither comport with own safety nor the right of the great body of the american people be thus show to be the duty of the executive to execute the law by all constitutional mean remain to consider the extent of those already at disposal and what may be proper further to provide in the instruction of the secretary of the treasury to the collector in south|carolina the provision and regulation make by the act of and also the fine penalty and forfeiture for enforcement be particularly detailed and explain may be well apprehend however that these provision may prove inadequate to meet such an open powerful organized opposition as be to be commence after the|1st|of|february next subsequently to the date of these instruction and to the passage of the ordinance information have be receive from source entitle to be rely on that owe to the popular excitement in the state and the effect of the ordinance declare the execution of the revenue law unlawful a sufficient number of person in whom confidence may be place could not be induce to accept the office of inspector to oppose with any probability of success the force which will no doubt be use when an attempt be make to remove vessel and cargo from the custody of the officer of the custom and indeed that would be impracticable for the collector with the aid of any number of inspector whom may be authorize to employ to preserve the custody against such an attempt the removal of the custom house from charleston to castle|pinckney be deem a measure of necessary precaution and though the authority to give that direction be not question be nevertheless apparent that a similar precaution can not be observe in regard to the port of georgetown and beaufort each of which under the present law remain a port of entry and expose to the obstruction meditate in that|quarter in consider the good mean of avoid or of prevent the apprehend obstruction to the collection of the revenue and the consequence which may ensue would appear to be proper and necessary to enable the officer of the custom to preserve the custody of vessel and cargo which by the exist law be require to take until the duty to which be liable shall be pay or secure the mode by which be contemplate to deprive of that custody be the process of replevin and that of capia in withernam in the nature of a distress from the state tribunal organize by the ordinance against the proceeding in the nature of a distress be not perceive that the collector can interpose any resistance whatever and against the process of replevin authorize by the law of the state have no common law power can only oppose such inspector as be by statute authorize and may find practicable to employ and these from the information already advert to be show to be wholly inadequate the respect which that process deserve must therefore be consider if the authority of south|carolina have not obstruct the legitimate action of the court of the|united|state or if have permit the state tribunal to administer the law accord to oath under the constitution and the regulation of the law of the union may have be content to look to for maintain the custody and to encounter the other inconvenience arise out of the recent proceeding even in that case however the process of replevin from the court of the state would be irregular and unauthorized have be decide by the|supreme|court of the|united|state that the court of the|united|state have exclusive jurisdiction of all seizure make on land or water for a breach of the law of the|united|state and any intervention of a state authority which by take the thing seize out of the hand of the officer may obstruct the exercise of this jurisdiction be unlawful that in such case the court of the|united|state have cognizance of the seizure may enforce a redelivery of the thing by attachment or other summary process that the question under such a seizure whether a forfeiture have be actually incur belong exclusively to the court of the|united|state and depend on the final decree whether the seizure be to be deem rightful or tortuous and that not until the seizure be finally judge wrongful and without probable cause by the court of the|united|state can the party proceed at common law for damage in the state court but by make unlawful for any of the constitute authority whether of the|united|state or of the state to enforce the law for the payment of duty and declare that all judicial proceeding which shall be hereafter have in affirmance of the contract make with purpose to secure the duty impose by the say act be and shall be hold utterly null and void have in effect abrogate the judicial tribunal within limit in this respect have virtually deny the|united|state access to the court establish by own law and declare unlawful for the judge to discharge those duty which be swear to perform in lieu of these have substitute those state tribunal already advert to the judge whereof be not merely forbid to allow an appeal or permit a copy of record but be previously swear to disregard the law of the union and enforce those only of south|carolina and thus deprive of the function essential to the judicial character of inquire into the validity of the law and the right of the matter become merely ministerial instrument in aid of the concerted obstruction of the law of the union neither the process nor authority of these tribunal thus constitute can be respect consistently with the supremacy of the law or the right and security of the citizen if be submit to the protection due from the government to officer and citizen be withhold and there be at once an end not only to the law but to the union against such a force as the sheriff may and which by the replevin law of south|carolina be duty to exercise can not be expect that a collector can retain custody with the aid of the inspector in such case be true would be competent to institute suit in court against those engage in the unlawful proceeding or the property may be seize for a violation of the revenue law and be libel in the proper court an order may be make for redelivery which would be commit to the marshal for execution but in that case the fourth section of the act in broad and unqualified term make the duty of the sheriff to prevent such recapture or seizure or to redeliver the good as the case may be even under any process order or decree or other pretext contrary to the true intent and meaning of the ordinance aforesaid be thus make the duty of the sheriff to oppose the process of the court of the|united|state and for that purpose if nee be to employ the whole power of the county and the act expressly reserve to all power which independently of provision could have use in this reservation obviously contemplate a resort to other mean than those particularly mention be not to be disguise that the power which be thus enjoin upon the sheriff to employ be nothing less than the posse comitatus in all the rigor of the ancient common law this power though may be use against unlawful resistance to judicial process be in character forcible and analogous to that confer upon the marshal by the|act|of|1795 be in fact the embodying of the whole mass of the population under the command of a single individual to accomplish by forcible aid what could not be effect peaceably and by the ordinary mean may properly be say to be a relic of those age in which the law could be defend rather by physical than moral force and in origin be confer upon the sheriff of england to enable to defend county against any of the king 's enemy when come into the land as well as for the purpose of execute process in early and less civilized time be intend to include the aid and attendance of all knight and other who be bind to have harness include the right of go with arm and military equipment and embrace large class and great masse of population than can be compel by the law of most of the states to perform militia duty if the principle of the common law be recognize in south|carolina and from this act would seem be the power of summon the posse comitatus will compel under the penalty of fine and imprisonment every man over the|age|of|15 and able to travel to turn out at the call of the sheriff and with such weapon as may be necessary and justify beating and even kill such as may resist the use of the posse comitatus be therefore a direct application of force and can not be otherwise regard than as the employment of the whole militia force of the county and in an equally efficient form under a different name no proceeding which resort to this power to the extent contemplate by the act can be properly denominate peaceable the act of south|carolina however do not rely altogether upon this forcible remedy for even attempt to resist or disobey though by the aid only of the ordinary officer of the custom the process of replevin the collector and all concerned be subject to a further proceeding in the nature of a distress of personal effect and be moreover make guilty of a misdemeanor and liable to be punish by a fine of not less|than|$1,000 nor more than and to imprisonment not exceed two|year and not less|than|six|month and for even attempt to execute the order of the court for retake the property the marshal and all assist would be guilty of a misdemeanor and liable to a fine of not less|than|$3,000 nor more than and to imprisonment not exceed two|year nor less than and in case the good should be retake under such process be make the absolute duty of the sheriff to retake be not to be suppose that in the face of these penalty aid by the powerful force of the county which would doubtless be bring to sustain the state officer either that the collector would retain the custody in the first instance or that the marshal could summon sufficient aid to retake the property pursuant to the order or other process of the court be moreover obvious that in this conflict between the power of the officer of the|united|state and of the state unless the latter be passively submit to the destruction to which the property of the officer of the custom would be expose the commission of actual violence and the loss of life would be scarcely avoidable under these circumstance and the provision of the act of south|carolina the execution of the law be render impracticable even through the ordinary judicial tribunal of the|united|state there would certainly be few difficulty and less opportunity of actual collision between the officer of the|united|state and of the state and the collection of the revenue would be more effectually secure if indeed can be do in any other way by place the custom house beyond the immediate power of the county for this purpose may be proper to provide that whenever by any unlawful combination or obstruction in any state or in any port should become impracticable faithfully to collect the duty the president of the|united|states should be authorize to alter and abolish such of the district and port of entry as should be necessary and to establish the custom house at some secure place within some port or harbor of such state and in such case should be the duty of the collector to reside at such place and to detain all vessel and cargo until the duty impose by law should be properly secure or pay in cash deduct interest that in such case should be unlawful to take the vessel and cargo from the custody of the proper officer of the custom unless by process from the ordinary judicial tribunal of the|united|state and that in case of an attempt otherwise to take the property by a force too great to be overcome by the officer of the custom should be lawful to protect the possession of the officer by the employment of the land and naval force and militia under provision similar to those authorize by the eleventh section of the act of the|9th|of|january,|1809 this provision however would not shield the officer and citizen of the|united|state act under the law from suit and prosecution in the tribunal of the state which may thereafter be bring against nor would protect property from the proceeding by distress and may well be apprehend that would be insufficient to insure a proper respect to the process of the constitutional tribunal in prosecution for offense against the|united|state and to protect the authority of the|united|state whether judicial or ministerial in the performance of duty would moreover be inadequate to extend the protection due from the government to that portion of the people of south|carolina against outrage and oppression of any kind who may manifest attachment and yield obedience to the law of the union may therefore be desirable to revive with some modification better adapt to the occasion the sixth section of the act of the 3d march,|1815 which expire on by the limitation of that of and to provide that in any case where suit shall be bring against any individual in the court of the state for any act do under the law of the|united|state should be authorize to remove the say cause by petition into the circuit court of the|united|state without any copy of the record and that the court should proceed to hear and determine the same as if have be originally institute therein and that in all case of injury to the person or property of individual for disobedience to the ordinance and law of south|carolina in pursuance thereof redress may be seek in the court of the|united|state may be expedient also by modify the resolution of the 3d march,|1791 to authorize the marshal to make the necessary provision for the safe keeping of prisoner commit under the authority of the|united|state provision less than these consist as do for the most part rather of a revival of the policy of former act call for by the exist emergency than of the introduction of any unusual or rigorous enactment would not cause the law of the union to be properly respect or enforce be believe these would prove adequate unless the military force of the|state|of|south|carolina authorize by the late act of the legislature should be actually embody and call out in aid of proceeding and of the provision of the ordinance generally even in that case however be believe that no more will be necessary than a few modification of term to adapt the|act|of|1795 to the present emergency as by that act the provision of the law of be accommodate to the crisis then exist and by confer authority upon the president to give operation during the session of congress and without the ceremony of a proclamation whenever shall be officially make known to by the authority of any state or by the court of the|united|state that within the limit of such state the law of the|united|state will be openly oppose and execution obstruct by the actual employment of military force or by any unlawful mean whatsoever too great to be otherwise overcome in close this communication should do injustice to own feeling not to express confident reliance upon the disposition of each department of the government to perform duty and to cooperate in all measure necessary in the present emergency the crisis undoubtedly invoke the fidelity of the patriot and the sagacity of the statesman not more in remove such portion of the public burden as may be necessary than in preserve the good order of society and in the maintenance of well regulate liberty while a forbear spirit may and trust will be exercise toward the error of brother in a|particular|quarter duty to the rest of the union demand that open and organized resistance to the law should not be execute with impunity the rich inheritance bequeath by father have devolve upon the sacred obligation of preserve by the same virtue which conduct through the eventful scene of the revolution and ultimately crown struggle with the noble model of civil institution bequeath to a government of law and a|federal|union found upon the great principle of popular representation after a successful experiment of four|year at a moment when the government and the union be the object of the hope of the friend of civil liberty throughout the world and in the midst of public and individual prosperity unexample in history be call to decide whether these law possess any force and that union the mean of self preservation the decision of this question by an enlightened and patriotic people can not be doubtful for fellow citizen devoutly rely upon that kind providence which have hitherto watch over destiny and actuate by a profound reverence for those institution have so much cause to love and for the american people whose partiality honor with high trust have determine to spare no effort to discharge the duty which in this conjuncture be devolve upon that a similar spirit will actuate the representative of the american people be not to be question and fervently pray that the|great|ruler|of|nation may so guide deliberation and joint measure as that may prove salutary example not only to the present but to future time and solemnly proclaim that the constitution and the law be supreme and the union indissoluble transcript by andrew|jackson president of the|united|state whereas a convention assemble in the|state|of|south|carolina have pass an ordinance by which declare that the several act and part of act of the|congress|of|the|united|state purport to be law for the imposing of duty and impost on the importation of foreign commodity and now have actual operation and effect within the|united|state and more especially act for the same purpose pass on the|29th|of|may,|1828 and on the|14th|of|july,|1832 be unauthorized by the|united|state and violate the true meaning and intent thereof and be null and void and no law nor bind on the citizen of that state or officer and by the say ordinance be further declare to be unlawful for any of the constitute authority of the state or of the|united|state to enforce the payment of the duty impose by the say act within the same state and that be the duty of the legislature to pass such law as may be necessary to give full effect to the say ordinance and whereas by the say ordinance be further ordain that in no case of law or equity decide in the court of say state wherein shall be draw in question the validity of the say ordinance or of the act of the legislature that may be pass to give effect or of the say law of the|united|state no appeal shall be allow to the|supreme|court of the|united|state nor shall any copy of the record be permit or allow for that purpose and that any person attempt to take such appeal shall be punish as for contempt of court and finally the say ordinance declare that the people of south|carolina will maintain the say ordinance at every hazard and that will consider the passage of any act by congress abolish or close the port of the say state or otherwise obstruct the free ingress or egress of vessel to and from the say port or any other act of the|federal|government to coerce the state shut up port destroy or harass commerce or to enforce the say act otherwise than through the civil tribunal of the country as inconsistent with the long continuance of south|carolina in the union and that the people of the say state will thenceforth hold absolve from all further obligation to maintain or preserve political connection with the people of the other states and will forthwith proceed to organize a separate government and do all other act and thing which sovereign and independent state may of right do and whereas the say ordinance prescribe to the people of south|carolina a course of conduct in direct violation of duty as citizen of the|united|state contrary to the law of country subversive of constitution and have for object the destruction of the union-- that union which coeval with political existence lead father without any other tie to unite than those of patriotism and a common cause through a sanguinary struggle to a glorious independence that sacre union hitherto inviolate which perfect by happy constitution have bring by the favor of heaven to a state of prosperity at home and high consideration abroad rarely if ever equal in the history of nation to preserve this bond of political existence from destruction to maintain inviolate this state of national honor and prosperity and to justify the confidence fellow citizen have repose in andrew|jackson president of the|united|state have think proper to issue this proclamation state view of the constitution and law applicable to the measure adopt by the convention of south|carolina and to the reason have put forth to sustain declare the course which duty will require to pursue and appeal to the understanding and patriotism of the people warn of the consequence that must inevitably result from an observance of the dictate of the convention strict duty would require of nothing more than the exercise of those power with which be now or may hereafter be invest for preserve the peace of the union and for the execution of the law but the impose aspect which opposition have assume in this case by clothe with state authority and the deep interest which the people of the|united|state must all feel in prevent a resort to strong measure while there be a hope that anything will be yield to reason and remonstrance perhaps demand and will certainly justify a full exposition to south|carolina and the nation of the view entertain of this important question as well as a distinct enunciation of the course which sense of duty will require to pursue the ordinance be found not on the indefensible right of resist act which be plainly unconstitutional and too oppressive to be endure but on the strange position that any state may not only declare an act of congress void but prohibit execution that may do this consistently with the constitution that the true construction of that instrument permit a state to retain place in the union and yet be bind by no other of law than those may choose to consider as constitutional be true add that to justify this abrogation of a law must be palpably contrary to the constitution but be evident that to give the right of resist law of that description couple with the uncontrolled right to decide what law deserve that character be to give the power of resist all law for as by the theory there be no appeal the reason allege by the state good or bad must prevail if should be say that public opinion be a sufficient check against the abuse of this power may be ask why be not deem a sufficient guard against the passage of an unconstitutional act by congress there be however a restraint in this last case which make the assume power of a state more indefensible and which do not exist in the other there be appeal from an unconstitutional act pass by congress to the judiciary the other to the people and the states there be no appeal from the state decision in theory and the practical illustration show that the court be close against an application to review both judge and juror be swear to decide in favor but reason on this subject be superfluous when social compact in express term declare that the law of the|united|state constitution and treaty make under be the supreme law of the land and for great caution add that the judge in every state shall be bind thereby anything in the constitution or law of any state to the contrary notwithstanding and may be assert without fear of refutation that no federative government could exist without a similar provision look for a moment to the consequence if south|carolina consider the revenue law unconstitutional and have a right to prevent execution in the port of charleston there would be a clear constitutional objection to collection in every other port and no revenue could be collect anywhere for all impost must be equal be no answer to repeat that an unconstitutional law be no law so long as the question of legality be to be decide by the state for every law operate injuriously upon any local interest will be perhaps think and certainly represent as unconstitutional and as have be show there be no appeal if this doctrine have be establish at an|earlier|day . the union would have be dissolve in infancy the excise law in pennsylvania the embargo and nonintercourse law in the|eastern|state the carriage tax in virginia be all deem unconstitutional and be more unequal in operation than any of the law now complain of but fortunately none of those states discover that have the right now claim by south|carolina the war into which be force to support the dignity of the nation and the right of citizen may have end in defeat and disgrace instead of victory and honor if the states who suppose a ruinous and unconstitutional measure have think possess the right of nullify the act by which be declare and deny supply for prosecution hardly and unequally as those measure bear upon several member of the union to the legislature of none do this efficient and peaceable remedy as be call suggest the discovery of this important feature in constitution be reserve to the|present|day to the statesman of south|carolina belong the invention and upon the citizen of that state will unfortunately fall the evil of reduce to practice if the doctrine of a state veto upon the law of the union carry with internal evidence of impracticable absurdity constitutional history will also afford abundant proof that would have be repudiate with indignation have be propose to form a feature in government in colonial state although dependent on another power very early consider as connect by common interest with each other league be form for common defense and before the declaration of independence be know in aggregate character as the|united|colonies|of|america that decisive and important step be take jointly declare a nation by a joint not by several act and when the term of confederation be reduce to form be in that of a solemn league of several states by which agree that would collectively form nation for the purpose of conduct some certain domestic concern and all foreign relation in the instrument form that union be find an article which declare that every state shall abide by the determination of congress on all question which by that confederation should be submit to under the confederation then no state could legally annul a decision of the congress or refuse to submit to execution but no provision be make to enforce these decision congress make requisition but be not comply with the government could not operate on individual have no judiciary no mean of collect revenue but the defect of the confederation need not be detail under operation could scarcely be call a nation have neither prosperity at home nor consideration abroad this state of thing could not be endure and present happy constitution be form but form in vain if this fatal doctrine prevail be form for important object that be announce in the preamble make in the name and by the authority of the people of the|united|state whose delegate frame and whose convention approve the most important among these object that which be place first in rank on which all the other rest be to form a more perfect union now be possible that even if there be no express provision give supremacy to the constitution and law of the|united|state over those of the states can be conceive that an instrument make for the purpose of form a more perfect union than that of the confederation could be so construct by the assemble wisdom of country as to substitute for that confederation a form of government dependent for existence on the local interest the party spirit of a state or of a prevail faction in a state every man of plain unsophisticated understanding who hear the question will give such an answer as will preserve the union metaphysical subtlety in pursuit of an impracticable theory could alone have devise that be calculate to destroy consider then the power to annul a law of the|united|state assume by state incompatible with the existence of the union contradict expressly by the letter of the constitution unauthorize by spirit inconsistent with every principle on which be found and destructive of the great object far which be form after this general view of the lead principle must examine the particular application of which be make in the ordinance the preamble rest justification on these ground assume as a fact that the obnoxious law although purport to be law for raise revenue be in reality intend for the protection of manufacture which purpose assert to be unconstitutional that the operation of these law be unequal that the amount raise by be great than be require by the want of the government and finally that the proceed be to be apply to object unauthorized by the constitution these be the only cause allege to justify an open opposition to the law of the country and a threat of secede from the union if any attempt should be make to enforce the first virtually acknowledge that the law in question be pass under a power expressly give by the constitution to lay and collect impost but constitutionality be draw in question from the motif of those who pass however apparent this purpose may be in the present case nothing can be more dangerous than to admit the position that an unconstitutional purpose entertain by the member who assent to a law enact under a constitutional power shall make that law void for how be that purpose to be ascertain who be to make the scrutiny how often may bad purpose be falsely impute in how many case be conceal by false profession in how many be no declaration of motive make admit this doctrine and give to the states an uncontrolled right to decide and every law may be annul under this pretext if therefore the absurd and dangerous doctrine should be admit that a state may annul an unconstitutional law or one that deem such will not apply to the present case the next objection be that the law in question operate unequally this objection may be make with truth to every law that have be or can be pass the wisdom of man never yet contrive a system of taxation that would operate with perfect equality if the unequal operation of a law make unconstitutional and if all law of that description may be abrogate by any state for that cause then indeed be the|federal|constitution unworthy of the slight effort for preservation have hitherto rely on as the perpetual bond of union have receive as the work of the assemble wisdom of the nation have trust to as to the sheet anchor of safety in the stormy time of conflict with a foreign or domestic foe have look to with sacred awe as the palladium of liberty and with all the solemnity of religion have pledge to each other life and fortune here and hope of happiness hereafter in defense and support be mistaken countryman in attach this importance to the constitution of country be devotion pay to the wretched inefficient clumsy contrivance which this new doctrine would make do pledge to the support of an airy nothing a bubble that must be blow away by the first breath of disaffection be this self destroy visionary theory the work of the profound statesman the exalt patriot to whom the task of constitutional reform be intrust do the name of washington sanction do the states deliberately ratify such an anomaly in the history of fundamental legislation no be not mistaken the letter of this great instrument be free from this radical fault language directly contradict the imputation spirit evident intent contradict no do not err constitution do not contain the absurdity of give power to make law and another to resist the sage whose memory will always be reverence have give a practical and as hope a permanent constitutional compact the father of country do not affix revere name to so palpable an absurdity nor do the states when severally ratify do so under the impression that a veto on the law of the|united|state be reserve to or that could exercise by implication search the debate in all convention examine the speech of the most zealous opposer of federal authority look at the amendment that be propose be all silent not a syllable utter not a vote give not a motion make to correct the explicit supremacy give to the law of the union over those of the states or to show that implication as be now contend could defeat no have not err the constitution be still the object of reverence the bond of union defense in danger the source of prosperity in peace shall descend as have receive uncorrupted by sophistical construction to posterity and the sacrifice of local interest of state prejudice of personal animosity that be make to bring into existence will again be patriotically offer for support the remain objection make by the ordinance to these law be that the sum intend to be raise by be great than be require and that the proceed will be unconstitutionally employ the constitution have give expressly to congress the right of raise revenue and of determine the sum the public exigency will require the states have no control over the exercise of this right other than that which result from the power of change the representative who abuse and thus procure redress congress may undoubtedly abuse this discretionary power but the same may be say of other with which be vested yet the discretion must exist somewhere the constitution have give to the representative of all the people check by the representative of the states and by the executive power the south|carolina construction give to the legislature or the convention of a single state where neither the people of the different states nor the states in separate capacity nor the chief magistrate elect by the people have any representation which be the most discreet disposition of the power do not ask fellow citizen which be the constitutional disposition that instrument speak a language not to be misunderstood but if be assemble in general convention which would think the safe depository of this discretionary power in the last resort would add a clause give to each of the states or would sanction the wise provision already make by constitution if this should be the result of deliberation when provide for the future be can be ready to risk all that hold dear to establish for a temporary and a local purpose that which must acknowledge to be destructive and even absurd as a general provision carry out the consequence of this right vest in the different states and must perceive that the crisis conduct present at this|day would recur whenever any law of the|united|state displease any of the states and that should soon cease to be a nation the ordinance with the same knowledge of the future that characterize a former objection tell that the proceed of the tax will be unconstitutionally apply if this could be ascertain with certainty the objection would with more propriety be reserve for the law so apply the proceed but surely can not be urge against the law levy the duty these be the allegation contain in the ordinance examine seriously fellow citizen judge for yourself appeal to to determine whether be so clear so convincing as to leave no doubt of correctness and even if should come to this conclusion how far justify the reckless destructive course which be direct to pursue review these objection and the conclusion draw from once more what be every law then for raise revenue accord to the south|carolina ordinance may be rightfully annul unless be so frame as no law ever will or can be frame congress have a right to pass law for raise revenue and each state have a right to oppose execution right directly oppose to each other and yet be this absurdity suppose to be contain in an instrument draw for the express purpose of avoid collision between the states and the|general|government by an assembly of the most enlightened statesman and pure patriot ever embody for a similar purpose in vain have these sage declare that congress shall have power to lay and collect taxis duty impost and excise in vain have provide that shall have power to pass law which shall be necessary and proper to carry those power into execution that those law and that constitution shall be the supreme law of the land and that the judge in every state shall be bind thereby anything in the constitution or law of any state to the contrary notwithstanding in vain have the people of the several states solemnly sanction these provision make paramount law and individually swear to support whenever be call on to execute any office vain provision ineffectual restriction vile profanation of oath miserable mockery of legislation if a bare majority of the voter in any state may on a real or suppose knowledge of the intent with which a law have be pass declare free from operation say here give too little there too much and operate unequally here suffer article to be free that ought to be tax there tax those that ought to be free in this case the proceed be intend to be apply to purpose which do not approve in that the amount raise be more than be want congress be true be invest by the constitution with the right of decide these question accord to sound discretion congress be compose of the representative of all the states and of all the people of all the states but part of the people of state to whom the constitution have give no power on the subject from whom have expressly take away who have solemnly agree that this constitution shall be law most of whom have swear to support now abrogate this law and swear and force other to swear that shall not be obey and do this not because congress have no right to pass such law this do not allege but because have pass with improper view be unconstitutional from the motif of those who pass which can never with certainty know from unequal operation although be impossible from the nature of thing that should be equal and from the disposition which presume may be make of proceed although that disposition have not be declare this be the plain meaning of the ordinance in relation to law which abrogate for alleged unconstitutionality but do not stop there repeal in express term an important part of the constitution and of law pass to give effect which have never be allege to be unconstitutional the constitution declare that the judicial power of the|united|state extend to case arise under the law of the|united|state and that such law the constitution and treaty shall be paramount to the state constitution and law the judiciary act prescribe the mode by which the case may be bring before a court of the|united|state by appeal when a state tribunal shall decide against this provision of the constitution the ordinance declare there shall be no appeal make the state law paramount to the constitution and law of the|united|state force judge and juror to swear that will disregard provision and even make penal in a suitor to attempt relief by appeal further declare that shall not be lawful for the authority of the|united|state or of that state to enforce the payment of duty impose by the revenue law within limit here be a law of the|united|state not even pretend to be unconstitutional repeal by the authority of a small majority of the voter of a single state here be a provision of the constitution which be solemnly abrogate by the same authority on such exposition and reasoning the ordinance ground not only an assertion of the right to annul the law of which complain but to enforce by a threat of secede from the union if any attempt be make to execute this right to secede be deduce from the nature of the constitution which say be a compact between sovereign states who have preserve whole sovereignty and therefore be subject to no superior that because make the compact can break when in opinion have be depart from by the other states fallacious as this course of reasoning be enlist state pride and find advocate in the honest prejudice of those who have not study the nature of government sufficiently to see the radical error on which rest the people of the|united|state form the constitution act through the state legislature in make the compact to meet and discuss provision and act in separate convention when ratify those provision but the term use in construction show to be a government in which the people of all the states collectively be represent be people in the choice of president and vice president here the state have no other agency than to direct the mode in which the vote shall be give the candidate have the majority of all the vote be choose the elector of a majority of states may have give vote for candidate and yet another may be choose the people then and not the states be represent in the executive branch in the|house|of|representatives there be this difference that the people of state do not as in the case of president and vice president all vote for the same officer the people of all the states do not vote for all the member each state elect only own representative but this create no material distinction when choose be all representative of the|united|state not representative of the particular state from which come be pay by the|united|state not by the state nor be accountable to for any act do in the performance of legislative function and however may in practice as be duty to do consult and prefer the interest of particular constituent when come in conflict with any other partial or local interest yet be first and high duty as representative of the|united|state to promote the general good the constitution of the|united|state then form a government not a league and whether be form by compact between the states or in any other manner character be the same be a government in which all the people be represent which operate directly on the people individually not upon the states retain all the power do not grant but each state have expressly part with so many power as to constitute jointly with the other states a single nation can not from that period possess any right to secede because such secession do not break a league but destroy the unity of a nation and any injury to that unity be not only a breach which would result from the contravention of a compact but be an offense against the whole union to say that any state may at pleasure secede from the union be to say that the|united|states be not a nation because would be a solecism to contend that any part of a nation may dissolve connection with the other part to injury or ruin without commit any offense secession like any other revolutionary act may be morally justify by the extremity of oppression but to call a constitutional right be confound the meaning of term and can only be do through gross error or to deceive those who be willing to assert a right but would pause before make a revolution or incur the penalty consequent on a failure because the union be form by a compact be say the party to that compact may when feel aggrieve depart from but be precisely because be a compact that can not a compact be an agreement or bind obligation may by term have a sanction or penalty for breach or may not if contain no sanction may be break with no other consequence than moral guilt if have a sanction then the breach incur the designate or imply penalty a league between independent nation generally have no sanction other than a moral or if should contain a penalty as there be no common superior can not be enforce a government on the contrary always have a sanction express or imply and in case be both necessarily imply and expressly give an attempt by force of arm to destroy a government be an offense by whatever mean the constitutional compact may have be form and such government have the right by the law of self defense to pass act for punish the offender unless that right be modify restrain or resume by the constitutional act in system although be modify in the case of treason yet authority be expressly give to pass all law necessary to carry power into effect and under this grant provision have be make for punish act which obstruct the due administration of the law would seem superfluous to add anything to show the nature of that union which connect but as erroneous opinion on this subject be the foundation of doctrine the most destructive to peace must give some further development to view on this subject no one fellow citizen have a high reverence for the reserve right of the states than the magistrate who now address no one would make great personal sacrifice or official exertion to defend from violation but equal care must be take to prevent on part an improper interference with or resumption of the right have vest in the nation the line have not be so distinctly draw as to avoid doubt in some case of the exercise of power men of the good intention and sound view may differ in construction of some part of the constitution but there be other on which dispassionate reflection can leave no doubt of this nature appear to be the assumed right of secession rest as have see on the allege undivided sovereignty of the states and on have form in this sovereign capacity a compact which be call the constitution from which because make have the right to secede both of these position be erroneous and some of the argument to prove so have be anticipate the states severally have not retain entire sovereignty have be show that in become part of a nation not member of a league surrender many of essential part of sovereignty the right to make treaty declare war levy taxis exercise exclusive judicial and legislative power be all of function of sovereign power the states then for all these important purpose be no longer sovereign the allegiance of citizen be transfer in the first instance to become american citizen and owe obedience to the|united|state and to law make in conformity with the power vest in congress this last position have not be and can not be deny how then can that state be say to be sovereign and independent whose citizen owe obedience to law not make by and whose magistrate be swear to disregard those law when come in conflict with those pass by another what show conclusively that the states can not be say to have reserve an undivided sovereignty be that expressly cede the right to punish treason not treason against separate power but treason against the|united|state treason be an offense against sovereignty and sovereignty must reside with the power to punish but the reserve right of the states be not less sacred because have for common interest make the depository of these power the unity of political character as have be show for another purpose commence with very existence under the royal government have no separate character opposition to oppression begin as united colony be the|united|state under the confederation and the name be perpetuate and the union render more perfect by the|federal|constitution in none of these stage do consider in any other light than as form nation treaty and alliance be make in the name of all troop be raise for the joint defense how then with all these proof that under all change of position have for designate purpose and with define power create national government how be that the most perfect of those several mode of union should now be consider as a mere league that may be dissolve at pleasure be from an abuse of term compact be use as synonymous with league although the true term be not employ because would at once show the fallacy of the reasoning would not do to say that constitution be only a league but be labor to prove a compact which in sense be and then to argue that as a league be a compact every compact between nation must of course be a league and that from such an engagement every sovereign power have a right to recede but have be show that in this sense the states be not sovereign and that even if be and the national constitution have be form by compact there would be no right in any state to exonerate from obligation so obvious be the reason which forbid this secession that be necessary only to allude to the union be form for the benefit of all be produce by mutual sacrifice of interest and opinion can those sacrifice be recall can the states who magnanimously surrender title to the territory of the west recall the grant will the inhabitant of the inland states agree to pay the duty that may be impose without assent by those on the atlantic or the gulf for own benefit shall there be a free port in state and onerous duty in another no one believe that any right exist in a single state to involve all the other in these and countless other evil contrary to engagement solemnly make everyone must see that the other states in self defense must oppose at all hazard these be the alternative that be present by the convention a repeal of all the act for raise revenue leave the government without the mean of support or an acquiescence in the dissolution of union by the secession of of member when the first be propose be know that could not be listen to for a moment be know if force be apply to oppose the execution of the law that must be repel by force that congress could not without involve in disgrace and the country in ruin accede to the proposition and yet if this be not do in a|given|day or if any attempt be make to execute the law the state be by the ordinance declare to be out of the union the majority of a convention assemble for the purpose have dictate these term or rather this rejection of all term in the name of the people of south|carolina be true that the governor of the state speak of the submission of grievance to a convention of all the states which say sincerely and anxiously seek and desire yet this obvious and constitutional mode of obtain the sense of the other states on the construction of the federal compact and amend if necessary have never be attempt by those who have urge the state on to this destructive measure the state may have propose the call for a general convention to the other states and congress if a sufficient number of concur must have call but the first magistrate of south|carolina when express a hope that on a review by congress and the functionary of the|general|government of the merit of the controversy such a convention will be accord to must have know that neither congress nor any functionary of the|general|government have authority to call such a convention unless be demand by third of the states this suggestion then be another instance of the reckless inattention to the provision of the constitution with which this crisis have be madly hurry on or of the attempt to persuade the people that a constitutional remedy have be seek and refuse if the legislature of south|carolina anxiously desire a general convention to consider complaint why have not make application for in the way the constitution point out the assertion that earnestly seek be completely negative by the omission this then be the position in which stand a small majority of the citizen of state in the union have elect delegate to a state convention that convention have ordain that all the revenue law of the|united|state must be repeal or that be no longer a member of the union the governor of that state have recommend to the legislature the raising of an army to carry the secession into effect and that may be empower to give clearance to vessel in the name of the state no act of violent opposition to the law have yet be commit but such a state of thing be hourly apprehend and be the intent of this instrument to proclaim not only that the duty impose on by the constitution to take care that the law be faithfully execute shall be perform to the extent of the power already vest in by law or of such other as the wisdom of congress shall devise and intrust to for that purpose but to warn the citizen of south|carolina who have be delude into an opposition to the law of the danger will incur by obedience to the illegal and disorganize ordinance of the convention to exhort those who have refuse to support to persevere in determination to uphold the constitution and law of country and to point out to all the perilous situation into which the good people of that state have be lead and that the course be urge to pursue be of ruin and disgrace to the very state whose right affect to support fellow citizen of native state let not only admonish as the|first|magistrate of common country not to incur the penalty of law but use the influence that a father would over child whom see rush to certain ruin in that paternal language with that paternal feeling let tell countryman that be delude by man who be either deceive or wish to deceive mark under what pretense have be lead on to the brink of insurrection and treason on which stand first a diminution of the value of staple commodity lower by overproduction in other|quarters and the consequent diminution in the value of land be the sole effect of the tariff law the effect of those law be confessedly injurious but the evil be greatly exaggerate by the unfounded theory be teach to believe that burthen be in proportion to export not to consumption of import article pride be rouse by the assertion that a submission to those law be a state of vassalage and that resistance to be equal in patriotic merit to the opposition father offer to the oppressive law of great|britain be tell that this opposition may be peaceably may be constitutionally make that may enjoy all the advantage of the union and bear none of burthen eloquent appeal to passion to state pride to native courage to sense of real injury be use to prepare for the period when the mask which conceal the hideous feature of disunion should be take off fall and be make to look with complacency on object which not long since would have regard with horror look back to the art which have bring to this state look forward to the consequence to which must inevitably lead look back to what be first tell as an inducement to enter into this dangerous course the great political truth be repeat to that have the revolutionary right of resist all law that be palpably unconstitutional and intolerably oppressive be add that the right to nullify a law rest on the same principle but that be a peaceable remedy this character which be give to make receive with too much confidence the assertion that be make of the unconstitutionality of the law and oppressive effect mark fellow citizen that by the admission of leader the unconstitutionality must be palpable or will not justify either resistance or nullification what be the meaning of the word palpable in the sense in which be here use that which be apparent to everyone that which no man of ordinary intellect will fail to perceive be the unconstitutionality of these law of that description let those among leader who once approve and advocate the principle of protective duty answer the question and let choose whether will be consider as incapable then of perceiving that which must have be apparent to every man of common understanding or as impose upon confidence and endeavor to mislead now in either case be unsafe guide in the perilous path urge to tread ponder well on this circumstance and will know how to appreciate the exaggerated language address to be not champion of liberty emulate the fame of revolutionary father nor be an oppressed people contend as repeat to against bad than colonial vassalage be free member of a flourishing and happy union there be no settle design to oppress have indeed feel the unequal operation of law which may have be unwisely not unconstitutionally pass but that inequality must necessarily be remove at the very moment when be madly urge on to the unfortunate course have begin a change in public opinion have commence the nearly approach payment of the public debt and the consequent necessity of a diminution of duty have already produce a considerable reduction and that too on some article of general consumption in state the importance of this change be underrated and be authoritatively tell that no further alleviation of burthen be to be expect at the very time when the condition of the country imperiously demand such a modification of the duty as should reduce to a just and equitable scale but as if apprehensive of the effect of this change in allay discontent be precipitate into the fearful state in which now find yourself have urge to look back to the mean that be use to hurry on to the position have now assume and forward to the consequence will produce something more be necessary contemplate the condition of that country of which still form an important part consider government unite in bond of common interest and general protection so many different states give to all inhabitant the proud title of american citizen protect commerce secure literature and art facilitate intercommunication defend frontier and make name respect in the remote part of the earth consider the extent of territory increase and happy population advance in art which render life agreeable and the science which elevate the mind see education spread the light of religion morality and general information into every cottage in this wide extent of territories and states behold as the asylum where the wretched and the oppress find a refuge and support look on this picture of happiness and honor and say too be citizen of america carolina be of these proud states arm have defend good blood have cement this happy union and then add if can without horror and remorse this happy union will dissolve this picture of peace and prosperity will deface this free intercourse will interrupt these fertile field will deluge with blood the protection of that glorious flag renounce the very name of americans discard and for what mistaken man for what do throw away these inestimable blessing for what would exchange share in the advantage and honor of the union for the dream of a separate independence a dream interrupt by bloody conflict with neighbor and a vile dependence on a foreign power if leader could succeed in establish a separation what would be situation be unite at home be free from the apprehension of civil discord with all fearful consequence do neighboring republic every|day suffer some new revolution or contend with some new insurrection do excite envy but the dictate of a high duty oblige solemnly to announce that can not succeed the law of the|united|state must be execute have no discretionary power on the subject duty be emphatically pronounce in the constitution those who tell that may peaceably prevent execution deceive could not have be deceive know that a forcible opposition could alone prevent the execution of the law and know that such opposition must be repel object be disunion but be not deceive by name disunion by armed force be treason be really ready to incur guilt if be on the head of the instigator of the act be the dreadful consequence on head be the dishonor but on may fall the punishment on unhappy state will inevitably fall all the evil of the conflict force upon the government of country can not accede to the mad project of disunion of which would be the first victim first magistrate can not if would avoid the performance of duty the consequence must be fearful for distress to fellow citizen here and to the friend of good government throughout the world enemy have behold prosperity with a vexation could not conceal be a standing refutation of slavish doctrine and will point to discord with the triumph of malignant joy be yet in power to disappoint there be yet time to show that the descendant of the pinckneys the sumpters the rutledges and of the other name which adorn the page of revolutionary history will not abandon that union to support which so many of fight and bleed and die adjure as honor memory as love the cause of freedom to which dedicate life as prize the peace of country the life of good citizen and own fair fame to retrace step snatch from the archive of state the disorganize edict of convention bid member to reassemble and promulgate the decided expression of will to remain in the path which alone can conduct to safety prosperity and honor tell that compare to disunion all other evil be light because that bring with an accumulation of all declare that will never take the field unless the star spangle banner of country shall float over that will not be stigmatize when dead and dishonor and scorn while live as the author of the first attack on the constitution of country destroyer can not be may disturb peace may interrupt the course of prosperity may cloud reputation for stability but tranquillity will be restore prosperity will return and the stain upon national character will be transfer and remain an eternal blot on the memory of those who cause the disorder fellow citizen of the|united|state the threat of unhallowed disunion the name of those once respect by whom be uttered the array of military force to support denote the approach of a crisis in affair on which the continuance of unexampled prosperity political existence and perhaps that of all free government may depend the conjuncture demand a free a full and explicit enunciation not only of intention but of principle of action and as the claim be assert of a right by a state to annul the law of the union and even to secede from at pleasure a frank exposition of opinion in relation to the origin and form of government and the construction give to the instrument by which be create seem to be proper have the full confidence in the justness of the legal and constitutional opinion of duty which have be express rely with equal confidence on undivided support in determination to execute the law to preserve the union by all constitutional mean to arrest if possible by moderate and firm measure the necessity of a recourse to force and if be the will of heaven that the recurrence of primeval curse on man for the shedding of a brother 's blood should fall upon land that be not call down by any offensive act on the part of the|united|state fellow citizen the momentous case be before on undivided support of government depend the decision of the great question involve whether sacred union will be preserve and the blessing secure to as people shall be perpetuate no one can doubt that the unanimity with which that decision will be express will be such as to inspire new confidence in republican institution and that the prudence the wisdom and the courage which will bring to defense will transmit unimpaired and invigorate to child may the great ruler of nations grant that the signal blessing with which have favor our may not by the madness of party or personal ambition be disregard and lose and may wise providence bring those who have produce this crisis to see the folly before feel the misery of civil strife and inspire a return veneration for that union which if may dare to penetrate design have choose as the only mean of attain the high destiny to which may reasonably aspire in testimony whereof have cause the seal of the|united|state to be hereunto affix have sign the same with

merit in mexico a sanguinary struggle be now carry on which have cause some embarrassment to commerce but both party profess the most friendly disposition toward to the termination of this contest look for the establishment of that secure intercourse so necessary to nation whose territory be contiguous how important will be to may calculate from the fact that even in this unfavorable state of thing maritime commerce have increase and an internal trade by caravan from st.|louis to santa|fe under the protection of escort furnish by the government be carry on to great advantage and be daily increase the agent provide for by the treaty with this power to designate the boundary which establish have be name on part but of the evil of the civil war now rage there have be that the appointment

require but claim be not neglect and will on all proper occasion be urge and be hope with effect refrain from make any communication on the subject of affair with buenos|aires because the negotiation communicate to in last annual message be at the date of last advice still pende and in a state that would render a publication of the detail inexpedient a treaty of amity and commerce have be form with the republic of chile which if approve by the senate will be lay before that government seem to be establish and at peace with neighbor and port be the resort of ship which be employ in the highly important trade of the fishery this commercial convention can not but be of great advantage to fellow citizen engage in that perilous but profitable business commerce with the neighboring state of peru owe to the onerous duty levy on principal article of export have be on the decline and all endeavor to procure an alteration have hitherto prove fruitless with bolivia have yet no diplomatic intercourse and the continual contest carry on between and peru have make defer until a more favorable period the appointment of any agent for that purpose an act of atrocious piracy have be commit on of trading ship by the inhabitant of a settlement on the west coast of sumatra a frigate be dispatch with order to demand satisfaction for the injury if those who commit should be find to be member of a regular government capable of maintain the usual relation with foreign nation but if as be suppose and as prove to be be a band of lawless pirate to inflict such a chastisement as would deter and other from like aggression this last be do and the effect have be an increase respect for flag in those distant sea and additional security for commerce in the view have give of connection with foreign power allusion have be make to domestic disturbance or foreign war to revolution or dissension may be proper to observe that this be do solely in case where those event affect political relation with or to show operation on commerce further than this be neither policy nor right to interfere good wish on all occasion good office when require will be afford to promote the domestic tranquillity and foreign peace of all nation with whom have any intercourse any intervention in affair further than this even by the expression of an official opinion be contrary to principle of international policy and will always be avoid the report which the secretary of the treasury will in due time lie before will exhibit the national finance in a highly prosperous state owe to the continued success of commercial enterprise which have enable the merchant to fulfill engagement with the government the receipt from custom during the|year will exceed the estimate present at the last session and with the other mean of the treasury will prove fully adequate not only to meet the increase expenditure result from the large appropriation make by congress but to provide for the payment of all the public debt which be at present redeemable be now estimate that the custom will yield to the treasury during the|present|year upward of the public land however have prove less productive than be anticipate and accord to present information will not much exceed the expenditure for all object other than the public debt be estimate to amount during the|year to about|$16,500,000 while a still large sum viz will have be apply to the principal and interest of the public debt be expect however that in consequence of the reduce rate of duty which will take effect after there will be a considerable fall off in the revenue from custom in the|year|1833 will never the less be amply sufficient to provide for all the want of the public service estimate even upon a liberal scale and for the redemption and purchase of the remainder of the public debt on the entire public debt of the|united|state fund and unfunded will be reduce to within a|fraction|of|$7,000,000 of which be not of right redeemable until and not until 02]. the commissioner of the sink fund however be invest with full authority to purchase the debt at the market price and the mean of the treasury be ample may be hope that the whole will be extinguish within the|year|1833 can not too cordially congratulate congress and fellow citizen on the near approach of that memorable and happy event the extinction of the public debt of this great and free nation faithful to the wise and patriotic policy mark out by the legislation of the country for this object the present administration have devote to all the mean which a flourish commerce have supply and a prudent economy preserve for the public treasury within the|four|years for which the people have confide the executive power to charge will have be apply to the payment of the public debt that this have be accomplish without stint the expenditure for all other proper object will be see by refer to the liberal provision make during the same period for the support and increase of mean of maritime and military defense for internal improvement of a national character for the removal and preservation of the indians and lastly for the gallant veteran of the revolution the final removal of this great burthen from resource afford the mean of further provision for all the object of general welfare and public defense which the constitution authorizes and present the occasion for such further reduction in the revenue as may not be require for from the report of the secretary of the treasury will be see that after such a reduction may be make to a considerable extent and the subject be earnestly recommend to the consideration of congress in the hope that the combined wisdom of the representative of the people will devise such mean of effect that salutary object as may remove those burthen which shall be find to fall unequally upon any and as may promote all the great interest of the community long and patient reflection have strengthen the opinion have heretofore express to congress on this subject and deem duty on the present occasion again to urge upon the attention of the legislature the sound maxim of public policy and the principal upon which republican institution be found recommend a proper adaptation of the revenue to the expenditure and also require that the expenditure shall be limit to what by an economical administration shall be consistent with the simplicity of the government and necessary to an efficient public service in effect this adjustment be due in justice to the interest of the different state and even to the preservation of the union that the protection afford by exist law to any branch of the national industry should not exceed what may be necessary to counteract the regulation of foreign nation and to secure a supply of those article of manufacture essential to the national independence and safety in time of war if upon investigation shall be find as be believe will be that the legislative protection grant to any particular interest be great than be indispensably requisite for these object recommend that be gradually diminish and that as far as may be consistent with these object the whole scheme of duty be reduce to the revenue standard as soon as a just regard to the faith of the government and to the preservation of the large capital invest in establishment of domestic industry will permit that manufacture adequate to the supply of domestic consumption would in the abstract be beneficial to country there be no reason to doubt and to effect establishment there be perhaps no american citizen who would not for a while be willing to pay a high price for but for this purpose be presume that a tariff of high duty design for perpetual protection which maintain have the effect to reduce the price by domestic competition below that of the foreign article experience however good guide on this as on other subject make doubtful whether the advantage of this system be not counter - balanced by many evil and whether do not tend to beget in the mind of a large portion of countryman a spirit of discontent and jealousy dangerous to the stability of the union what then shall be do large interest have grow up under the imply pledge of national legislation which would seem a violation of public faith suddenly to abandon nothing could justify but the public safety which be the supreme law but those who have vest capital in manufacturing establishment can not expect that the people will continue permanently to pay high taxis for benefit when the money be not require for any legitimate purpose in the administration of the government be not enough that the high duty have be pay as long as the money arise from could be apply to the common benefit in the extinguishment of the public debt those who take an enlarged view of the condition of country must be satisfied that the policy of protection must be ultimately limit to those article of domestic manufacture which be indispensable to safety in time of war within this scope on a reasonable scale be recommend by every consideration of patriotism and duty which will doubtless always secure to a liberal and efficient support but beyond this object have already see the operation of the system productive of discontent in some section of the republic influence be deprecate as tend to concentrate wealth into a few hand and as create those germ of dependence and vice which in other country have characterize the existence of monopoly and prove so destructive of liberty and the general good a large portion of the people in section of the republic declare not only inexpedient on these ground but as disturb the equal relation of property by legislation and therefore unconstitutional and unjust doubtless these effect be in a great degree exaggerate and may be ascribe to a mistaken view of the consideration which lead to the adoption of the tariff system but be never the less important in enable to review the subject with a more thorough knowledge of all bearing upon the great interest of the republic and with a determination to dispose of so that none can with justice complain be painful duty to state that in one|quarter of opposition to the revenue law have arise to a height which threaten to thwart execution if not to endanger the integrity of the union what ever obstruction may be throw in the way of the judicial authority of the general government be hope will be able peaceably to overcome by the prudence of own officer and the patriotism of the people but should this reasonable reliance on the moderation and good sense of all portion of fellow citizen be disappoint be believe that the law be fully adequate to the suppression of such attempt as may be immediately make should the exigency arise render the execution of the exist law impracticable from any cause what ever prompt notice of will be give to congress with a suggestion of such view and measure as may be deem necessary to meet in conformity with principle heretofore explain and with the hope of reduce the general government to that simple machine which the constitution create and of withdraw from the states all other influence than that of universal beneficence in preserve peace afford an uniform currency maintain the inviolability of contract diffuse intelligence and discharge unfelt other super - intending function recommend that provision be make to dispose of all stock now hold by in corporation whether create by the general or state government and place the proceed in the treasury as a source of profit these stock be of little or no value as a means of influence among the state be adverse to the purity of institution the whole principle on which be base be deem by many unconstitutional and to persist in the policy which indicate be consider wholly inexpedient be duty to acquaint with an arrangement make by the|bank|of|the|united|state with a portion of the holder of the stock by which the government will be deprive of the use of the public fund longer than be anticipate by this arrangement which will be particularly explain by the secretary of the treasury a surrender of the certificate of this stock may be postpone until and thus may be continue by the failure of the bank to perform duty such measure as be within the reach of the secretary of the treasury have be take to enable to judge whether the public deposit in that institution may be regard as entirely safe but as limited power may prove inadequate to this object recommend the subject to the attention of congress under the firm belief that be worthy of serious investigation an inquiry into the transaction of the institution embrace the branch as well as the principal bank seem call for by the credit which be give throughout the country to many serious charge impeach character and which if true may justly excite the apprehension that be no longer a safe depository of the money of the people among the interest which merit the consideration of congress after the payment of the public debt of the most important in view be that of the public land previous to the formation of present constitution be recommend by congress that a portion of the waste land own by the state should be cede to the|united|states for the purpose of general harmony and as a fund to meet the expense of the war the recommendation be adopt and at different period of time the state of massachusetts new|york virginia north|and|south|carolina and georgia grant vacant soil for the us for which have be ask as the land may now be consider as relieve from this pledge be in the discretion of congress to dispose of in such way as best to conduce to the quiet harmony and general interest of the american people in examine this question all local and sectional feeling should be discard and the whole united|stat regard as people interested alike in the prosperity of common country can not be doubt that the speedy settlement of these land constitute the true interest of the republic the wealth and strength of a country be population and the good part of that population be cultivator of the soil independent farmer be every where the basis of society and true friend of liberty in addition to these consideration question have already arise and may be expect hereafter to grow out of the public land which involve the right of the new state and the power of the general government and unless a liberal policy be now adopt there be danger that these question may speedily assume an importance not now generally anticipate the influence of a great sectional interest when bring into full action will be find more dangerous to the harmony and union of the state than any other cause of discontent and be the part of wisdom and sound policy to foresee approach and endeavor if possible to counteract of the various scheme which have be hitherto propose in regard to the disposal of the public land none have yet receive the entire approbation of the national legislature deeply impressed with the importance of a speedy and satisfactory arrangement of the subject deem duty on this occasion to urge upon consideration and to the proposition which have be heretofore suggest by other to contribute those reflection which have occur to in the hope that may assist in future deliberation seem to to be policy that the public land shall cease as soon as practicable to be a source of revenue and that be sell to settler in limited parcel at a price barely sufficient to reimburse to the|united|states the expense of the present system and the cost arise under indian compact the advantage of accurate survey and undoubted title now secure to purchaser seem to forbid the abolition of the present system because none can be substitute which will more perfectly accomplish these important end be desirable however that in convenient time this machinery be withdraw from the state and that the right of soil and the future disposition of be surrender to the state respectively in which lie the adventurous and hardy population of the west besides contribute equal share of taxation under impost system have in the progress of government for the land occupy pay into the treasury a large proportion of and of the revenue receive therefrom but a small part have be expend among when to the disadvantage of situation in this respect add the consideration that be labor alone which give real value to the land and that the proceed arise from sale be distribute chiefly among state which have not originally any claim to and which have enjoy the undivided emolument arise from the sale of own land can not be expect that the new state will remain longer content with the present policy after the payment of the public debt to avert the consequence which may be apprehend from this cause to pub an end for ever to all partial and interested legislation on the subject and to afford to every american citizen of enterprise the opportunity of secure an independent freehold seem to therefore best to abandon the idea of raise a future revenue out of the public land in former message have express conviction that the constitution do not warrant the application of the fund of the general government to object of internal improvement which be not national in character and both as a means of do justice to all interest and put an end to a course of legislation calculate to destroy the purity of the government have urge the necessity of reduce the whole subject to some fix and certain rule as there never will occur a period perhaps more propitious than the present to the accomplishment of this object beg leave to press the subject again upon attention without some general and well define principle ascertain those object of internal improvement to which the mean of the nation may be constitutionally apply be obvious that the exercise of the power can never be satisfactory besides the danger to which expose congress of make hasty appropriation to work of the character of which may be frequently ignorant promote a mischievous and corrupt influence upon election by hold out to the people the fallacious hope that the success of a certain candidate will make navigable neighboring creek or river bring commerce to door and increase the value of property thus favor combination to squander the treasure of the country upon a multitude of local object as fatal to just legislation as to the purity of public man if a system compatible with the constitution can not be devise which be free from such tendency should recollect that that instrument provide within the mode of amendment and that there be therefore no excuse for the assumption of doubtful power by the general government if those which be clearly grant shall be find incompetent to the end of creation can at any time apply for enlargement and there be no probability that such an application if found on the public interest will ever be refuse if the propriety of the propose grant be not sufficiently apparent to command the assent of fourth of the state the good possible reason why the power should not be assume on doubtful authority be afford for if more than quarter of the state be unwilling to make the grant exercise will be productive of discontent which will far over balance any advantage that could be derive from all must admit that there be nothing so worthy of the constant solicitude of this government as the harmony and union of the people be solemnly impressed with the conviction that the extension of the power to make internal improvement beyond the limit have suggest even if be deem constitutional be subversive of the good interest of country earnestly recommend to congress to refrain from exercise in doubtful case except in relation to improvement already begin unless shall first procure from the state such an amendment of the constitution as will define character and prescribe bound if the state feel competent to these object why should this government wish to assume the power if do not then will not hesitate to make the grant both government be the government of the people improvement must be make with the money of the people and if the money can be collect and apply by those more simple and economical political machine the state government will unquestionably be safe and well for the people than to add to the splendor the patronage and the power of the general government but if the people of the several state think otherwise will amend the constitution and in decision all ought cheerfully to acquiesce for a detailed and highly satisfactory view of the operation of the|war|department refer to the accompanying report of the secretary of war the hostile incursion of the sac and fox|indians necessarily lead to the interposition of the government a portion of the troop under generals|scott and atkinson and of the militia of the state of illinois be call into the field after a harass warfare prolong by the nature of the country and by the difficulty of procure subsistence the indians be entirely defeat and the disaffect band disperse or destroy the result have be creditable to the troop engage in the service severe as be the lesson to the indians be render necessary by unprovoked aggression and be to be hope that impression will be permanent and salutary this campaign have evince the efficient organization of the army and capacity for prompt and active service several department have perform function with energy and dispatch and the general movement be satisfactory fellow citizen upon the frontier be ready as always be in the tender of service in the|hour of danger but a more efficient organization of militia system be essential to that security which be of the principal object of all government neither situation nor institution require or permit the maintenance of a large regular force history offer too many lesson of the fatal result of such a measure not to warn against adoption here the expense which attend the obvious tendency to employ because exist and thus to engage in unnecessary war and ultimate danger to public liberty will lead trust to place principal dependence for protection upon the great body of the citizen of the republic if in assert right or in repel wrong war should come upon regular force should be increase to an extent proportional to the emergency and present small army be a nucleus around which such force could be form and embody but for the purpose of defense under ordinary circumstance must rely upon the elector of the country those by whom and for whom the government be institute and be support will constitute protection in the|hour of danger as do check in the|hour of safety but be obvious that the militia system be imperfect much time be lose much unnecessary expense incur and much public property waste under the present arrangement little useful knowledge be gain by the muster and drill as now establish and the whole subject evidently require a thorough examination whether a plan of classification remedying these defect and provide for a system of instruction may not be adopt be submit to the consideration of congress the constitution have vest in the general government an independent authority upon the subject of the militia which render action essential to the establishment or improvement of the system and recommend the matter to consideration in the conviction that the state of this important arm of the public defense require attention be happy to inform that the wise and humane policy of transfer from the eastern to the western side of the mississippi the remnant of aboriginal tribe with own consent and upon just term have be steadily pursue and be approach trust consummation by reference to the report of the secretary of war and to the document submit with will see the progress which have be make since last session in the arrangement of the various matter connect with indian relation with exception every subject involve any question of conflict jurisdiction or of peculiar difficulty have be happily dispose of and the conviction evidently gain ground among the indians that removal to the country assign by the|united|state for permanent residence furnish the only hope of ultimate prosperity with that portion of the cherokees however live within the state of georgia have be find impracticable as yet to make a satisfactory adjustment such be anxiety to remove all the ground of complaint and to bring to a termination the difficulty in which be involve that direct the very liberal proposition to be make to which accompany the document herewith submit can not but have see in these offer the evidence of the strong disposition on the part of the government to deal justly and liberally with an ample indemnity be offer for present possession a liberal provision for future support and improvement and full security for private and political right what ever difference of opinion may have prevail respect the just claim of these people there will probably be none respect the liberality of the proposition and very little respect the expediency of immediate acceptance be however reject and thus the position of these indians remain unchanged as do the view communicate in message to the senate of refer to the annual report of the secretary of the navy which accompany this message for a detail of the operation of that branch of the service during the|present|year besides the general remark on some of the transaction of navy present in the view which have be take of foreign relation seize this occasion to invite to notice the increase protection which have afford to commerce and citizen on distant sea without any augmentation of the force in commission in the gradual improvement of pecuniary concern in the constant progress in the collection of material suitable for use during future emergency and in the construction of vessel and the building necessary to preservation and repair the present state of this branch of the service exhibit the fruit of that vigilance and care which be so indispensable to efficiency various new suggestion contain in the annex report as well as other heretofore to congress be worthy of attention but none more so than that urge the renewal for another term of six|year of the general appropriation for the gradual improvement of the navy from the accompanying report of the|postmaster|general will also perceive that that department continue to extend usefulness without impair resource or lessen the accommodation which afford in the secure and rapid transportation of the mail beg leave to call the attention of congress to the view heretofore express in relation to the mode of choose the president and vice president of the|united|state and to those respect the tenure of office generally still impressed with the justness of those view and with the belief that the modification suggest on those subject if adopt will contribute to the prosperity and harmony of the country earnestly recommend to consideration at this time have heretofore point out defect in the law for punish official fraud especially within have be find almost impossible to bring notorious culprit to punishment and accord to a decision of the court for this district a prosecution be bar by a lapse of two|year after the fraud have be commit may happen again as have already happen that during the whole two|year all the evidence of the fraud may be in the possession of the culprit however proper the limitation may be in relation to private citizen would seem that ought not to commence run in favor of public officer until go out of office the judiciary system of the|united|state remain imperfect of the western and southwestern state only enjoy the benefit of a circuit court ohio kentucky and tennessee be embrace in the general system but indiana illinois missouri alabama mississippi and louisiana have only district court if the exist system be a good one why should not be extend if be a bad one why be suffer to exist the new state be promise equal right and privilege when come into the union and such be the guaranty of the constitution nothing can be more obvious than the obligation of the general government to place all the state on the same footing in relation to the administration of justice and trust this duty will be neglect no longer on many of the subject to which attention be invite in this communication be a source of gratification to reflect that the step to be now adopt be uninfluence by the embarrassment entail upon the country by the war through which have pass in regard to most of great interest may consider as just start in career and after a salutary experience about to fix upon a permanent basis the policy best calculate to promote the happiness of the people and facilitate progress toward the most complete enjoyment of civil liberty on an occasion so interesting and important in history and of such anxious concern to the friend of freedom throughout the world be imperious duty to lay aside all selfish and local consideration and be guide by a lofty spirit of devotion to the great principle on which institution be found that this government may be so administer as to preserve efficiency in promote and secure these general object should be the only aim of ambition and can not therefore too carefully examine structure in order that may not mistake power or assume those which the people have reserve to or have prefer to assign to other agent should bear constantly in mind the fact that the consideration which induce the framer of the constitution to withhold from the general government the power to regulate the great mass of the business and concern of the people have be fully justify by experience and that can not now be doubt that the genius of all institution prescribe simplicity and economy as the characteristic of the reform which be yet to be effect in the present and future execution of the function bestow upon by the constitution limit to a general superintend power to maintain peace at home and abroad and to prescribe law on a few subject of general interest not calculate to restrict human liberty but to enforce human right this government will find strength and glory in the faithful discharge of these plain and simple duty relieve by protect shield from the fear of war and the apprehension of oppression the free enterprise of citizen aid by the state sovereignty will work out improvement and amelioration which can not fail to demonstrate that the great truth that the people can govern be not only realize in example but that be do by a machinery in government so simple and economical as scarcely to be feel that the almighty ruler of the universe may so direct deliberation and overrule act as to make instrumental in secure a result so dear to mankind be most earnest and sincere prayer transcript the bill to modify and continue the act entitle an act to incorporate the subscriber to the|bank|of|the|united|state be present to on the 4th july instant have consider with that solemn regard to the principle of the constitution which the|day be calculate to inspire and come to the conclusion that ought not to become a law herewith return to the senate in which originate with objection a bank of the|united|state be in many respect convenient for the government and useful to the people entertain this opinion and deeply impressed with the belief that some of the power and privilege possess by the exist bank be unauthorized by the constitution subversive of the right of the states and dangerous to the liberty of the people feel duty at an early period of administration to call the attention of congress to the practicability of organize an institution combine all advantage and obviate these objection sincerely regret that in the act before can perceive none of those modification of the bank charter which be necessary in opinion to make compatible with justice with sound policy or with the constitution of country the present corporate body denominate the president director and company of the|bank|of|the|united|state will have exist at the time this act be intend to take effect twenty|year enjoy an exclusive privilege of banking under the authority of the|general|government a monopoly of favor and support and as a necessary consequence almost a monopoly of the foreign and domestic exchange the power privilege and favor bestow upon in the original charter by increase the value of the stock far above par value operate as a gratuity of many million to the stockholder an apology may be find for the failure to guard against this result in the consideration that the effect of the original act of incorporation could not be certainly foresee at the time of passage the act before propose another gratuity to the holder of the same stock and in many case to the same man of at|least|seven|million more this donation find no apology in any uncertainty as to the effect of the act on all hand be concede that passage will increase at|least|20 or per cent more the market price of the stock subject to the payment of the annuity of per year secure by the act thus add in a moment fourth to par value be not own citizen only who be to receive the bounty of government more|than|eight|million of the stock of this bank be hold by foreigner by this act the|american|republic propose virtually to make a present of for these gratuity to foreigner and to some of own opulent citizen the act secure no equivalent whatever be the certain gain of the present stockholder under the operation of this act after make full allowance for the payment of the bonus every monopoly and all exclusive privilege be grant at the expense of the public which ought to receive a fair equivalent the|many|million which this act propose to bestow on the stockholder of the exist bank must come directly or indirectly out of the earning of the american people be due to therefore if government sell monopoly and exclusive privilege that should at least exact for as much as be worth in open market the value of the monopoly in this case may be correctly ascertain the eight|million of stock would probably be at an advance of and command in market at|least|$42,000,000 subject to the payment of the present bonus the present value of the monopoly therefore be and this the act propose to sell for three|million payable in annual installment of each be not conceivable how the present stockholder can have any claim to the special favor of the government the present corporation have enjoy monopoly during the period stipulate in the original contract if must have such a corporation why should not the government sell out the whole stock and thus secure to the people the full market value of the privilege grant why should not congress create and sell eight|million of stock incorporate the purchaser with all the power and privilege secure in this act and put the premium upon the sale into the treasury but this act do not permit competition in the purchase of this monopoly seem to be predicate on the erroneous idea that the present stockholder have a prescriptive right not only to the favor but to the bounty of government appear that part of the stock be hold by foreigner and the residue be hold by a|few|hundred of own citizen chiefly of the rich class for benefit do this act exclude the whole american people from competition in the purchase of this monopoly and dispose of for many million less than be worth this seem the less excusable because some of citizen not now stockholder petition that the door of competition may be open and offer to take a charter on term much more favorable to the government and country but this proposition although make by man whose aggregate wealth be believe to be equal to all the private stock in the exist bank have be set aside and the bounty of government be propose to be again bestow on the few who have be fortunate enough to secure the stock and at this moment wield the power of the exist institution can not perceive the justice or policy of this course if government must sell monopoly would seem to be duty to take nothing less than full value and if gratuity must be make once in fifteen|or|twenty|year let not be bestow on the subject of a foreign government nor upon a designated and favor class of man in own country be but justice and good policy as far as the nature of the case will admit to confine favor to own fellow citizen and let each in turn enjoy an opportunity to profit by bounty in the bearing of the act before upon these point find ample reason why should not become a law have be urge as an argument in favor of rechartere the present bank that the calling in loan will produce great embarrassment and distress the time allow to close concern be ample and if have be well manage pressure will be light and heavy only in case management have be bad if therefore shall produce distress the fault will be own and would furnish a reason against renew a power which have be so obviously abused but will there ever be a time when this reason will be less powerful to acknowledge force be to admit that the bank ought to be perpetual and as a consequence the present stockholder and those inherit right as successor be establish a privileged order clothe both with great political power and enjoy immense pecuniary advantage from connection with the government the modification of the exist charter propose by this act be not such in view as make consistent with the right of the states or the liberty of the people the qualification of the right of the bank to hold real estate the limitation of power to establish branch and the power reserve to congress to forbid the circulation of small note be restriction comparatively of little value or importance all the objectionable principle of the exist corporation and most of odious feature be retain without alleviation the fourth section provide that the note or bill of the say corporation although the same be on the face thereof respectively make payable at place only shall nevertheless be receive by the say corporation at the bank or at any of the office of discount and deposit thereof if tender in liquidation or payment of any balance or balance due to say corporation or to such office of discount and deposit from any other incorporated bank this provision secure to the state bank a legal privilege in the|bank|of|the|united|state which be withhold from all private citizen if a state bank in philadelphia owe the|bank|of|the|united|state and have note issue by the st.|louis branch can pay the debt with those note but if a merchant mechanic or other private citizen be in like circumstance can not by law pay debt with those note but must sell at a discount or send to st.|louis to be cash this boon concede to the state bank though not unjust in be most odious because do not measure out equal justice to the high and the low the rich and the poor to the extent of practical effect be a bond of union among the banking establishment of the nation erect into an interest separate from that of the people and necessary tendency be to unite the|bank|of|the|united|state and the state bank in any measure which may be think conducive to common interest the ninth section of the act recognize principle of bad tendency than any provision of the present charter enact that the cashier of the bank shall annually report to the secretary of the treasury the name of all stockholder who be not resident citizen of the|united|state and on the application of the treasurer of any state shall make out and transmit to such treasurer a list of stockholder reside in or citizen of such state with the amount of stock own by each although this provision take in connection with a decision of the|supreme|court surrender by silence the right of the states to tax the banking institution create by this corporation under the name of branch throughout the union be evidently intend to be construe as a concession of right to tax that portion of the stock which may be hold by own citizen and resident in this light if the act become a law will be understand by the states who will probably proceed to levy a tax equal to that pay upon the stock of bank incorporate by in some states that tax be now either on the capital or on the share and that may be assume as the amount which all citizen or resident stockholder would be tax under the operation of this act as be only the stock hold in the states and not that employ within which would be subject to taxation and as the name of foreign stockholder be not to be report to the treasurer of the states be obvious that the stock hold by will be exempt from this burden annual profit will therefore be more than the citizen stockholder and as the annual dividend of the bank may be safely estimate at the stock will be worth more to foreigner than to citizen of the|united|state to appreciate the effect which this state of thing will produce must take a brief review of the operation and present condition of the|bank|of|the|united|state by document submit to congress at the present session appear that on the|1st|of|january,|1832 of the eight|million of private stock in the corporation be hold by foreigner mostly of great|britain the amount of stock hold in the western and southwestern states be and in the southern|states be and in the middle and eastern states be about|$13,522,000 the profit of the bank in as show in a statement to congress be about|$3,455,598 of this there accrue in the western|state about|$1,640,048 in the southern|states about|$352,507 and in the middle and eastern states about|$1,463,041 as little stock be hold in the west be obvious that the debt of the people in that section to the bank be principally a debt to the eastern and foreign stockholder that the interest pay upon be carry into the|eastern|state and into europe and that be a burden upon industry and a drain of currency which no country can bear without inconvenience and occasional distress to meet this burden and equalize the exchange operation of the bank the amount of specie draw from those state through branch within the|last|two|year as show by official report be about|$6,000,000 more|than|half|a|million of this amount do not stop in the|eastern|state but pass on to europe to pay the dividend of the foreign stockholder in the principle of taxation recognize by this act the|western|state find no adequate compensation for this perpetual burden on industry and drain of currency the branch bank at mobile make last|year yet under the provision of this act the state of alabama can raise no revenue from these profitable operation because not a share of the stock be hold by any of citizen mississippi and missouri be in the same condition in relation to the branch at natchez and st.|louis and such in a great or less degree be the condition of every western|state the tendency of the plan of taxation which this act propose will be to place the whole united|stat in the same relation to foreign country which the|western|state now bear to the eastern when by a tax on resident stockholder the stock of this bank be make worth more to foreigner than to resident most of will inevitably leave the country thus will this provision in practical effect deprive the eastern as well as the southern and western states of the mean of raise a revenue from the extension of business and great profit of this institution will make the american people debtor to alien in nearly the whole amount due to this bank and send across the atlantic from two|to|five|millions of specie every year to pay the bank dividend in another of bearing this provision be fraught with danger of the director of this bank be choose by the government and by the citizen stockholder from all voice in these election the foreign stockholder be exclude by the charter in proportion therefore as the stock be transfer to foreign holder the extent of suffrage in the choice of director be curtail already be almost|a|third of the stock in foreign hand and not represent in election be constantly pass out of the country and this act will accelerate departure the entire control of the institution would necessarily fall into the hand of a few citizen stockholder and the ease with which the object would be accomplish would be a temptation to design man to secure that control in own hand by monopolize the remain stock there be danger that a president and director would then be able to elect from year to year and without responsibility or control manage the whole concern of the bank during the existence of charter be easy to conceive that great evil to country and institution may flow from such a concentration of power in the hand of a few man irresponsible to the people be there no danger to liberty and independence in a bank that in nature have so little to bind to country the president of the bank have tell that most of the state bank exist by forbearance should influence become concentered as may under the operation of such an act as this in the hand of a self elect directory whose interest be identify with those of the foreign stockholder will there not be cause to tremble for the purity of election in peace and for the independence of country in war power would be great whenever may choose to exert but if this monopoly be regularly renew every|fifteen|or|twenty|year on term propose by may seldom in peace put forth strength to influence election or control the affair of the nation but if any private citizen or public functionary should interpose to curtail power or prevent a renewal of privilege can not be doubt that would be make to feel influence should the stock of the bank principally pass into the hand of the subject of a foreign country and should unfortunately become involved in a war with that country what would be condition of the course which would be pursue by a bank almost wholly own by the subject of a foreign power and manage by those whose interest if not affection would run in the same direction there can be no doubt all operation within would be in aid of the hostile fleet and army without control currency receive public money and hold thousand of citizen in dependence would be more formidable and dangerous than the naval and military power of the enemy if must have a bank with private stockholder every consideration of sound policy and every impulse of american feeling admonishe that should be purely american stockholder should be compose exclusively of own citizen who at least ought to be friendly to government and willing to support in time of difficulty and danger so abundant be domestic capital that competition in subscribe for the stock of local bank have recently lead almost to riot to a bank exclusively of american stockholder possess the power and privilege grant by this act subscription for could be readily obtain instead of send abroad the stock of the bank in which the government must deposit fund and on which must rely to sustain credit in time of emergency would rather seem to be expedient to prohibit sale to alien under penalty of absolute forfeiture be maintain by the advocate of the bank that constitutionality in all feature ought to be consider as settle by precedent and by the decision of the|supreme|court to this conclusion can not assent mere precedent be a dangerous source of authority and should not be regard as decide question of constitutional power except where the acquiescence of the people and the states can be consider as well settle so far from this be the case on this subject an argument against the bank may be base on precedent congress in decide in favor of a bank another in decide against congress in decide against a bank another in decide in favor prior to the present congress therefore the precedent draw from that source be equal if resort to the states the expression of legislative judicial and executive opinion against the bank have be probably to those in favor as to there be nothing in precedent therefore which if authority be admit ought to weigh in favor of the act before if the opinion of the|supreme|court cover the whole ground of this act ought not to control the coordinate authority of this government the congress the executive and the court must each for be guide by own opinion of the constitution each public officer who take an oath to support the constitution swear that will support as understand and not as be understand by other be as much the duty of the|house|of|representatives of the senate and of the president to decide upon the constitutionality of any bill or resolution which may be present to for passage or approval as be of the supreme judge when may be bring before for judicial decision the opinion of the judge have no more authority over congress than the opinion of congress have over the judge and on that point the president be independent of both the authority of the|supreme|court must not therefore be permit to control the congress or the executive when act in legislative capacity but to have only such influence as the force of reasoning may deserve but in the case rely upon the|supreme|court have not decide that all the feature of this corporation be compatible with the constitution be true that the court have say that the law incorporate the bank be a constitutional exercise of power by congress but take into view the whole opinion of the court and the reasoning by which have come to that conclusion understand to have decide that inasmuch as a bank be an appropriate mean for carry into effect the enumerate power of the|general|government therefore the law incorporate be in accordance with that provision of the constitution which declare that congress shall have power to make all law which shall be necessary and proper for carry those power into execution have satisfy that the word necessary in the constitution mean needful requisite essential conducive to and that a bank be a convenient a useful and essential instrument in the prosecution of the government 's fiscal operation conclude that to use one must be within the discretion of congress and that the act to incorporate the|bank|of|the|united|states be a law make in pursuance of the constitution but say where the law be not prohibit and be really calculate to effect any of the object intrust to the government to undertake here to inquire into the degree of necessity would be to pass the line which circumscribe the judicial department and to tread on legislative ground the principle here affirm be that the degree of necessity involve all the detail of a banking institution be a question exclusively for legislative consideration a bank be constitutional but be the province of the legislature to determine whether this or that particular power privilege or exemption be necessary and proper to enable the bank to discharge duty to the government and from decision there be no appeal to the court of justice under the decision of the|supreme|court therefore be the exclusive province of congress and the president to decide whether the particular feature of this act be necessary and proper in order to enable the bank to perform conveniently and efficiently the public duty assign to as a fiscal agent and therefore constitutional or unnecessary and improper and therefore unconstitutional without comment on the general principle affirm by the|supreme|court let examine the detail of this act in accordance with the rule of legislative action which have lay down will be find that many of the power and privilege confer on can not be suppose necessary for the purpose for which be propose to be create and be not therefore mean necessary to attain the end in view and consequently not justify by the constitution the original act of incorporation section|21 enact that no other bank shall be establish by any future law of the|united|state during the continuance of the corporation hereby create for which the faith of the|united|state be hereby pledge provide congress may renew existing charter for bank within not increase the capital thereof and may also establish any other bank or bank in say district with capital not exceed in the whole if shall deem expedient this provision be continue in force by the act before fifteen|year from the of march if congress possess the power to establish bank have power to establish if in opinion or more bank have be necessary to facilitate the execution of the power delegate to in the constitution if possess the power to establish a second bank be a power derive from the constitution to be exercise from time to time and at any time when the interest of the country or the emergency of the government may make expedient be possess by congress as well as another and by all congresses alike and alike at every session but the congress of have take away from successor for twenty|years and the congress of propose to abolish for fifteen|year more can not be necessary or proper for congress to barter away or divest of any of the power vest in by the constitution to be exercise for the public good be not necessary to the efficiency of the bank nor be proper in relation to and successor may properly use the discretion vest in but may not limit the discretion of successor this restriction on and grant of a monopoly to the bank be therefore unconstitutional in another point of view this provision be a palpable attempt to amend the constitution by an act of legislation the constitution declare that the congress shall have power to exercise exclusive legislation in all case whatsoever over constitutional power therefore to establish bank in the|district|of|columbia and increase capital at will be unlimited and uncontrollable by any other power than that which give authority to the constitution yet this act declare that congress shall not increase the capital of exist bank nor create other bank with capital exceed in the whole the constitution declare that congress shall have power to exercise exclusive legislation over this district in all case whatsoever and this act declare shall not which be the supreme law of the land this provision can not be necessary or proper or constitutional unless the absurdity be admit that whenever be necessary and proper in the opinion of congress have a right to barter away portion of the power vest in by the constitution as a means of execute the rest on subject only do the constitution recognize in congress the power to grant exclusive privilege or monopoly declare that congress shall have power to promote the progress of science and useful art by secure for limited time to author and inventor the exclusive right to respective writing and discovery out of this express delegation of power have grow law of patent and copyright as the constitution expressly delegate to congress the power to grant exclusive privilege in these case as the mean of execute the substantive power to promote the progress of science and useful art be consistent with the fair rule of construction to conclude that such a power be not intend to be grant as a means of accomplish any other end on every other subject which come within the scope of congressional power there be an ever live discretion in the use of proper mean which can not be restrict or abolish without an amendment of the constitution every act of congress therefore which attempt by grant of monopoly or sale of exclusive privilege for a limited time or a time without limit to restrict or extinguish own discretion in the choice of mean to execute delegated power be equivalent to a legislative amendment of the constitution and palpably unconstitutional this act authorizes and encourage transfer of stock to foreigner and grant an exemption from all state and national taxation so far from be necessary and proper that the bank should possess this power to make a safe and efficient agent of the government in fiscal operation be calculate to convert the|bank|of|the|united|state into a foreign bank to impoverish people in time of peace to disseminate a foreign influence through every section of the republic and in war to endanger independence the several states reserve the power at the formation of the constitution to regulate and control title and transfer of real property and most if not all of have law disqualify alien from acquire or hold land within limit but this act in disregard of the undoubted right of the states to prescribe such disqualification give to alien stockholder in this bank an interest and title as member of the corporation to all the real property may acquire within any of of this union this privilege grant to alien be not necessary to enable the bank to perform public duty nor in any sense proper because be vitally subversive of the right of the|state the government of the|united|state have no constitutional power to purchase land within the states except for the erection of fort magazine arsenal dockyard and other needful building and even for these object only by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be by make stockholder in the bank and grant to the corporation the power to purchase land for other purpose assume a power not grant in the constitution and grant to other what do not possess be not necessary to the receiving safe keeping or transmission of the fund of the government that the bank should possess this power and be not proper that congress should thus enlarge the power delegate to in the constitution the old bank|of|the|united|state possess a capital of only|$11,000,000 which be find fully sufficient to enable with dispatch and safety to perform all the function require of by the government the capital of the present bank be -at least more than experience have prove to be necessary to enable a bank to perform public function the public debt which exist during the period of the old bank and on the establishment of the new have be nearly pay off and revenue will soon be reduce this increase of capital be therefore not for public but for private purpose the government be the only proper judge where agent should reside and keep office because good know where presence will be necessary can not therefore be necessary or proper to authorize the bank to locate branch where please to perform the public service without consult the government and contrary to will the principle lay down by the|supreme|court concede than congress can not establish a bank for purpose of private speculation and gain but only as a means of execute the delegate power of by the same principle a branch bank can not constitutionally be establish for other than public purpose the power which this act give to establish branch in any state without the injunction or request of the government and for other than public purpose be not necessary to the due execution of the power delegate to congress the bonus which be exact from the bank be a confession upon the face of the act that the power grant by be great than be necessary to character of a fiscal agent the government do not tax officer and agent for the privilege of serve the bonus of a|million|and|a|half require by the original charter and that of three|million propose by this act be not exact for the privilege of give the necessary facility for transfer the public fund from place to place within the|united|state or the territories thereof and for distribute the same in payment of the public creditor without charge commission or claim allowance on account of the difference of exchange as require by the act of incorporation but for something more beneficial to the stockholder the original act declare that the bonus be grant in consideration of the exclusive privilege and benefit confer by this act upon the say bank and the act before declare to be in consideration of the exclusive benefit and privilege continue by this act to the say corporation for fifteen|years as aforesaid be therefore for exclusive privilege and benefit confer for own use and emolument and not for the advantage of the government that a bonus be exact these surplus power for which the bank be require to pay can not surely be necessary to make the fiscal agent of the treasury if be the exaction of a bonus for would not be proper be maintain by some that the bank be a means of execute the constitutional power to coin money and regulate the value thereof congress have establish a mint to coin money and pass law to regulate the value thereof the money so coin with value so regulated and such foreign coin as congress may adopt be the only currency know to the constitution but if have other power to regulate the currency be confer to be exercise by and not to be transfer to a corporation if the bank be establish for that purpose with a charter unalterable without consent congress have part with power for a|term|of|years during which the constitution be a dead letter be neither necessary nor proper to transfer legislative power to such a bank and therefore unconstitutional by silence consider in connection with the decision of the|supreme|court in the case of mcculloch against the state of maryland this act take from the states the power to tax a portion of the banking business carry on within limit in subversion of of the strong barrier which secure against federal encroachment banking like farming manufacturing or any other occupation or profession be a business the right to follow which be not originally derive from the law every citizen and every company of citizen in all of states possess the right until the state legislature deem good policy to prohibit private banking by law if the prohibitory state law be now repeal every citizen would again possess the right the state bank be a qualified restoration of the right which have be take away by the law against banking guard by such provision and limitation as in the opinion of the state legislature the public interest require these corporation unless there be an exemption in charter be like private banker and banking company subject to state taxation the manner in which these taxis shall be lay depend wholly on legislative discretion may be upon the bank upon the stock upon the profit or in any other mode which the sovereign power shall will upon the formation of the|constitution|the|states guard tax power with peculiar jealousy surrender only as regard import and export in relation to every other object within jurisdiction whether person property business or profession be secure in as ample a manner as be before possess all person though united|stat officer be liable to a poll tax by the states within which reside the land of the|united|state be liable to the usual land tax except in the new states from whom agreement that will not tax unsold land be exact when be admit into the union horse wagon any beast or vehicle tool or property belong to private citizen though employ in the service of the|united|state be subject to state taxation every private business whether carry on by an officer of the|general|government or not whether be mix with public concern or not even if be carry on by the|united|state separately or in partnership fall within the scope of the tax power of the state nothing come more fully within than bank and the business of banking by whomsoever institute and carry on over this whole subject matter be just as absolute unlimited and uncontrollable as if the constitution have never be adopt because in the formation of that instrument be reserve without qualification the principle be concede that the states can not rightfully tax the operation of the|general|government can not tax the money of the government deposit in the state bank nor the agency of those bank in remit but will any man maintain that mere selection to perform this public service for the|general|government would exempt the state bank and ordinary business from state taxation have the|united|state instead of establish a bank at philadelphia employ a private banker to keep and transmit fund would have deprive pennsylvania of the right to tax bank and usual banking operation will not be pretend upon what principle then be the banking establishment of the|bank|of|the|united|state and usual banking operation to be exempt from taxation be not public agency or the deposit of the government which the states claim a right to tax but bank and banking power institute and exercise within state jurisdiction for private emolument those power and privilege for which pay a bonus and which the states tax in own bank the exercise of these power within a state no matter by whom or under what authority whether by private citizen in original right by corporate body create by the states by foreigner or the agent of foreign government locate within limit form a legitimate object of state taxation from this and like source from the person property and business that be find reside locate or carry on under jurisdiction must the states since the surrender of right to raise a revenue from import and export draw all the money necessary for the support of government and the maintenance of independence there be no more appropriate subject of taxation than bank banking and bank stock and none to which the states ought more pertinaciously to cling can not be necessary to the character of the bank as a fiscal agent of the government that private business should be exempt from that taxation to which all the state bank be liable nor can conceive proper that the substantive and most essential power reserve by the states shall be thus attack and annihilate as a means of execute the power delegate to the|general|government may be safely assume that none of those sage who have an agency in form or adopt constitution ever imagine that any portion of the tax power of the states not prohibit to nor delegate to congress be to be sweep away and annihilate as a means of execute certain power delegate to congress if power over mean be so absolute that the|supreme|court will not call in question the constitutionality of an act of congress the subject of which be not prohibit and be really calculate to effect any of the object intrust to the government although as in the case before take away power expressly grant to congress and right scrupulously reserve to the states become to proceed in legislation with the utmost caution though not directly own power and the right of the states may be indirectly legislate away in the use of mean to execute substantive power may not enact that congress shall not have the power of exclusive legislation over but may pledge the faith of the|united|state that as a means of execute other power shall not be exercise for twenty|year or forever may not pass an act prohibit the states to tax the banking business carry on within limit but may as a means of execute power over other object place that business in the hand of agent and then declare exempt from state taxation in hand thus may own power and the right of the states which can not directly curtail or invade be fritter away and extinguish in the use of mean employ by to execute other power that a bank of the|united|state competent to all the duty which may be require by the government may be so organized as not to infringe on own delegated power or the reserve right of the states do not entertain a doubt have the executive be call upon to furnish the project of such an institution the duty would have be cheerfully perform in the absence of such a call be obviously proper that should confine to point out those prominent feature in the act present which in opinion make incompatible with the constitution and sound policy a general discussion will now take place elicit new light and settle important principle and a new congress elect in the midst of such discussion and furnish an equal representation of the people accord to the last census will bear to the capitol the verdict of public opinion and doubt not bring this important question to a satisfactory result under such circumstance the bank come forward and ask a renewal of charter for a term of fifteen|years upon condition which not only operate as a gratuity to the stockholder of many|millions|of|dollar but will sanction any abuse and legalize any encroachment suspicion be entertain and charge be make of gross abuse and violation of charter an investigation unwillingly concede and so restrict in time as necessarily to make incomplete and unsatisfactory disclose enough to excite suspicion and alarm in the practice of the principal bank partially unveil in the absence of important witness and in numerous charge confidently make and as yet wholly uninvestigated there be enough to induce a majority of the committee of investigation a committee which be select from the most able and honorable member of the|house|of|representatives to recommend a suspension of further action upon the bill and a prosecution of the inquiry as the charter have yet four|year to run and as a renewal now be not necessary to the successful prosecution of business be to have be expect that the bank conscious of purity and proud of character would have withdraw application for the present and demand the severest scrutiny into all transaction in decline to do so there seem to be an additional reason why the functionary of the government should proceed with less haste and more caution in the renewal of monopoly the bank be professedly establish as an agent of the executive branch of the government and constitutionality be maintain on that ground neither upon the propriety of present action nor upon the provision of this act be the executive consult have have no opportunity to say that neither need nor want an agent clothe with such power and favor by such exemption there be nothing in legitimate function which make necessary or proper whatever interest or influence whether public or private have give birth to this act can not be find either in the wish or necessity of the executive department by which present action be deem premature and the power confer upon agent not only unnecessary but dangerous to the government and country be to be regret that the rich and powerful too often bend the act of government to selfish purpose distinction in society will always exist under every just government equality of talent of education or of wealth can not be produce by human institution in the full enjoyment of the gift of heaven and the fruit of superior industry economy and virtue every man be equally entitle to protection by law but when the law undertake to add to these natural and just advantage artificial distinction to grant title gratuity and exclusive privilege to make the rich rich and the potent more powerful the humble member of society the farmer mechanic and laborer who have neither the time nor the mean of secure like favor to have a right to complain of the injustice of government there be no necessary evil in government evil exist only in abuse if would confine to equal protection and as heaven do rain shower favor alike on the high and the low the rich and the poor would be an unqualified blessing in the act before there seem to be a wide and unnecessary departure from these just principle nor be government to be maintain or union preserve by invasion of the right and power of the several states in thus attempt to make general|government strong make weak true strength consist in leave individual and states as much as possible to in make feel not in power but in beneficence not in control but in protection not in bind the states more closely to the center but leave each to move unobstructed in proper orbit experience should teach wisdom most of the difficulty government now encounter and most of the danger which impend over union have spring from an abandonment of the legitimate object of government by national legislation and the adoption of such principle as be embody in this act many of rich man have not be content with equal protection and equal benefit but have beseech to make rich by act of congress by attempt to gratify desire have in the result of legislation array section against section interest against interest and man against man in a fearful commotion which threaten to shake the foundation of union be time to pause in career to review principle and if possible revive that devoted patriotism and spirit of compromise which distinguish the sage of the|revolution and the father of union if can not at once in justice to interest vest under improvident legislation make government what ought to be can at least take a stand against all new grant of monopoly and exclusive privilege against any prostitution of government

citizen shall be grateful and happy if not shall find in the motif which impel ample ground for contentment and peace in the difficulty which surround and the danger which threaten institution there

have already be make in this work and of all that remain to be do will be perceive that much information be yet necessary for the faithful performance of the duty of the government without which will be impossible to provide for the execution of some of the exist stipulation or make those prudential arrangement upon which the final success of the whole movement so far as relate to the indians must

nation to a high place in respect this last advantage be that have result in a great degree from the principle which have guide intercourse with foreign power since have assume an equal station among and hence the annual account which the executive render to the country of the manner in which that branch of duty have be fulfil prove instructive and salutary the pacific and wise policy of government keep in a state of neutrality during the war that have at different period since political existence be carry on by other power but this policy while give activity and extent to commerce expose in the same proportion to injury from the belligerent nation hence have arise claim of indemnity for those injury england france spain holland sweden denmark naples and lately portugal have all in a great or less degree infringe neutral right demand for reparation be make upon all have have in all and continue to have in some case a lead influence on the nature of relation with the power on whom be make of the claim upon england be unnecessary to speak further than to say that the state of thing to which prosecution and denial give rise have be succeed by arrangement productive of mutual good feeling and amicable relation between the country which be hope will not be interrupt of these arrangement be that relate to the colonial trade which be communicate to congress at the last session and although the short period during which have be in force will not enable to form an accurate judgment of operation there be every reason to believe that will prove highly beneficial the trade thereby authorize have employ to upward of 30,000|ton of american|and|15,000|tons of foreign shipping in the outward voyage and in the inward nearly an equal amount of american and only of foreign tonnage advantage too have result to agricultural interest from the state of the trade between canada and territory and state border or the|st.|lawrence and the lake which may prove more than equivalent to the loss sustain by the discrimination make to favor the trade of the northern colony with the|west|indy after transition from the state of colony to that of an independent nation many point be find necessary to be settle between and great|britain among be the demarcation of boundary not describe with sufficient precision in the treaty of peace some of the line that divide the state and territory of the|united|state from the british province have be definitively fix that however which separate from the province of canada and new|brunswick to the north and the east be still in dispute when come into office but find arrangement make for settlement over which have no control the commissioner who have be appoint under the provision of the|treaty|of|ghent have be unable to agree a convention be make with great|britain by immediate predecessor in office with the advice and consent of the senate by which be agree that the point of difference which have arise in the settlement of the boundary line between the american and british dominion as describe in the fifth article of the|treaty|of|ghent shall be refer as therein provide to some friendly sovereign or state who shall be invite to investigate and make a decision upon such point of difference and the|king|of|the|netherland have by the late president and his|britannic|majesty be designate as such friendly sovereign become duty to carry with good faith the agreement so make into full effect to this end cause all the measure to be take which be necessary to a full exposition of case to the sovereign arbiter and nominate as minister plenipotentiary to court a distinguished citizen of the state most interested in the question and who have be of the agent previously employ for settle the controversy on majesty the king of the netherlands deliver to the plenipotentiary of the|united|state and of great|britain write opinion on the case refer to the paper in relation to the subject will be communicate by a special message to the proper branch of the government with the perfect confidence that wisdom will adopt such measure as will secure an amicable settlement of the controversy without infringe any constitutional right of the state immediately interested afford satisfaction to inform that suggestion make by direction to the charg d'affaires of his|britannic|majesty to this government have have desire effect in produce the release of certain american citizen who be imprison for set up the authority of the state of maine at a place in the dispute territory under the actual jurisdiction of his|britannic|majesty from this and the assurance have receive of the desire of the local authority to avoid any cause of collision have the good hope that a good understanding will be keep up until be confirm by the final disposition of the subject the amicable relation which now subsist between the|united|state and great|britain the increase intercourse between citizen and the rapid obliteration of unfriendly prejudice to which former event naturally give rise concur to present this as a fit period for renew endeavor to provide against the recurrence of cause of irritation which in the event of war between great|britain and any other power would inevitably endanger peace animate by the sincere desire to avoid such a state of thing and peacefully to secure under all possible circumstance the right and honor of the country have give such instruction to the minister lately send to the|court|of|london as will evince that desire and if meet by a correspondent disposition which can not doubt will put an end to cause of collision which without advantage to either tend to estrange from each other nation who have every motive to preserve not only peace but an intercourse of the most amicable nature in message at the opening of the last session of congress express a confident hope that the justice of claim upon france urge as be with perseverance and signal ability by minister there would finally be acknowledge this hope have be realize a treaty have be sign which will immediately be lay before the senate for approbation and which contain stipulation that require legislative act must have the concurrence of both house before can be carry into effect by the french government engage to pay a sum which if not quite equal to that which may be find due to citizen will yet be believe under all circumstance be deem satisfactory by those interested the offer of a gross sum instead of the satisfaction of each individual claim be accept because the only alternative be a rigorous exaction of the whole amount state to be due on each claim which may in some instance be exaggerate by design in other overrate through error and which therefore would have be both ungracious and unjust to have insist on or a settlement by a mixed commission to which the french negotiator be very averse and which experience in other case have shew to be dilatory and often wholly inadequate to the end a comparatively small sum be stipulate on part to go to the extinction of all claim by french citizen on government and a reduction of duty on cotton and wine have be agree on as a consideration for the renunciation of an important claim for commercial privilege under the construction give to the treaty for the cession of louisiana should this treaty receive the proper sanction a source of irritation will be stop that have for so|many|year in some degree alienate from each other nation who from interest as well as the remembrance of early association ought to cherish the most friendly relation an encouragement will be give for perseverance in the demand of justice by this new proof that if steadily pursue will be listen to and admonition will be offer to those power if any which may be incline to evade that will never be abandon above all a just confidence will be inspire in fellow citizen that government will exert all the power with which have invest in support of just claim upon foreign nation at the same time that the frank acknowledgment and provision for the payment of those which be address to equity although unsupported by legal proof afford a practical illustration of submission to the divine rule of do to other what desire should do unto sweden and denmark have make compensation for the irregularity commit by vessel or in port to the perfect satisfaction of the party concern and have renew the treaty of commerce enter into with political and commercial relation with those power continue to be on the most friendly footing with spain difference up to be settle by the treaty of washington of that date but at a subsequent period commerce with the state formerly colony of spain on the continent of america be annoy and frequently interrupt by public and private armed ship capture many of vessel prosecute a lawful commerce and sell and cargo and at time to demand for restoration and indemnity oppose the allegation that be take in the violation of a blockade of all the port of those state this blockade be declaratory only and the inadequacy of the force to maintain be so manifest that this allegation be varied to a charge of trade in contraband of war this in turn be also find untenable and the minister whom send with instruction to press for the reparation that be due to injure fellow citizen have transmit an answer to demand by which the capture be declare to have be legal and be justified because the independence of the state of america never have be acknowledge by spain have a right to prohibit trade with under old colonial law this ground of defense be contradictory not only to those which have be formerly allege but to the uniform practice and establish law of nation and have be abandon by spain in the convention which grant indemnity to british subject for capture make at the same time under the same circumstance and for the same allegation with those of which complain however indulge the hope that further reflection will lead to other view and feel confident that when his|catholic|majesty shall be convince of the justice of the claim desire to preserve friendly relation between the country which be earnest endeavor to maintain will induce to accede to demand have therefore dispatch a special messenger with instruction to minister to bring the case once more to consideration to the end that if which can not bring to believe the same decision that can not but be deem an unfriendly denial of justice should be persist in the matter may before adjournment be lay before the constitutional judge of what be proper to be do when negotiation for redress of injury fail the conclusion of a treaty for indemnity with france seem to present a favorable opportunity to renew claim of a similar nature on other power and particularly in the case of those upon naples more especially as in the course of former negotiation with that power failure to induce france to render justice be use as an argument against the desire of the merchant who be the principal sufferer have therefore be accede to and a mission have be institute for the special purpose of obtain for a reparation already too long delay this measure have be resolve on be put in execution without wait for the meeting of congress because the state of europe create an apprehension of event that may have render application ineffectual demand upon the government of the sicilies be of a peculiar nature the injury on which be found be not deny nor be the atrocity and perfidy under which those injury be perpetrate attempt to be extenuate the sole ground on which indemnity have be refuse be the alleged illegality of the tenure by which the monarch who make the seizure hold crown this defense always unfounded in any principle of the law of nation now universally abandon even by those power upon whom the responsibility for the act of past ruler bear the most heavily will unquestionably be give up by sicilian majesty whose counsel will receive an impulse from that high sense of honor and regard to justice which be say to characterize and feel the full confidence that the talent of the citizen commission for that purpose will place before the just claim of injure citizen in such as light as will enable before adjournment to announce that have be adjust and secure precise instruction to the effect of bring the negotiation to a speedy issue have be give and will be obey in the late blockade of terceira some of the portuguese fleet capture several of vessel and commit other excess for which reparation be demand and be on the point of dispatch an armed force to prevent any recurrence of a similar violence and protect citizen in the prosecution of lawful commerce when official assurance on which rely make the sailing of the ship unnecessary since that period frequent promise have be make that full indemnity shall be give for the injury inflict and the loss sustain in the performance there have be some perhaps unavoidable delay but have the full confidence that earnest desire that this business may at once be close which minister have be instruct strongly to express will very soon be gratify have the well ground for this hope from the evidence of a friendly disposition which that government have show an actual reduction in the duty on rice the produce of southern state authorize the anticipation that this important article of export will soon be admit on the same footing with that produce by the most favor nation with the other power of europe have fortunately have no cause of discussion for the redress of injury with political connection be of the most friendly and commercial of the most liberal kind enjoy the advantage of navigation and trade give to the most favor nation but have not yet suit policy or perhaps have not be find convenient from other consideration to give stability and reciprocity to those privilege by a commercial treaty the ill health of the minister last|year charge with make a proposition for that arrangement do not permit to remain at st.|petersburg and the attention of that government during the whole of the period since departure have be occupy by the war in which be engage have be assure that nothing could have be effect by presence a minister will soon be nominate as well to effect this important object as to keep up the relation of amity and good understanding of which have receive so many assurance and proof from imperial majesty and the emperor predecessor the treaty with austria be open to an important trade with the hereditary dominion of the emperor the value of which have be hitherto little known and of course not sufficiently appreciate while commerce find an entrance into the south of germany by mean of this treaty those have form with the hanseatic town and prussia and other now in negotiation will open that vast country to the enterprising spirit of merchant on the north a country abound in all the material for a mutually beneficial commerce fill with enlightened and industrious inhabitant hold an important place in the politic of europe and to which owe so many valuable citizen the ratification of the treaty with the porte be send to be exchange by the gentleman appoint charge d'affaire to that court some difficulty occur on arrival but at the date of last official dispatch suppose have be obviate and that there be every prospect of the exchange be speedily effect this finish the connected view have think proper to give of political and commercial relation in europe every effort in power will be continue to strengthen and extend by treaty found on principle of the most perfect reciprocity of interest neither ask nor concede any exclusive advantage but liberate as far as lie in power the activity and industry of fellow citizen from the shackle which foreign restriction may impose to china and the east indies commerce continue in usual extent and with increase facility which the credit and capital of merchant afford by substitute bill for payment in specie a dare outrage have be commit in those sea by the plunder of of merchant man engage in the pepper trade at a port in sumatra and the piratical perpetrator belong to tribe in such a state of society that the usual course of proceeding between civilized nation could not be pursue forthwith dispatch a frigate with order to require immediate satisfaction for the injury and indemnity to the sufferer few change have take place in connection with the independent state of america since last communication to congress the ratification of a commercial treaty with the|united|republics of mexico have be for some time under deliberation in congress but be still undecided at the date of last dispatch the unhappy civil commotion that have prevail there be undoubtedly the cause of the delay but as the government be now say to be tranquillize may hope soon to receive the ratification of the treaty and an arrangement for the demarcation of the boundary between in the mean time an important trade have be open with mutual benefit from st.|louis in the state of missouri by caravan to the interior province of mexico this commerce be protect in progress through the indian country by the troop of the|united|state which have be permit to escort the caravan beyond boundary to the settled part of the mexican territory from central|america have receive assurance of the most friendly kind and a gratify application for good office to remove a suppose indisposition toward that government in a neighboring state this application be immediately and successfully comply with give also the pleasing intelligence that difference which have prevail in internal affair have be peaceably adjust treaty with this republic continue to be faithfully observe and promise a great and beneficial commerce between the country a commerce of the great importance if the magnificent project of a ship canal through the dominion of that state from the atlantic to now in serious contemplation shall be execute have great satisfaction in communicate the success which have attend the exertion of minister in colombia to procure a very considerable reduction in the duty on flour in that republic indemnity also have be stipulate for injury receive by merchant from illegal seizure and renew assurance be give that the treaty between the country shall be faithfully observe chili and peru seem to be still threaten with civil commotion and until shall be settle disorder may naturally be apprehend require the constant presence of a naval force in to protect fishery and guard commerce the disturbance that take place in the|empire|of|brazil previously to and immediately consequent upon the abdication of the late emperor necessarily suspend any effectual application for the redress of some past injury suffer by citizen from that government while have be the cause of other in which all foreigner seem to have participate instruction have be give to minister there to press for indemnity due for loss occasion by these irregularity and to take care of fellow citizen shall enjoy all the privilege stipulate in favor by the treaty lately make between the power all which the good intelligence that prevail between minister at rio|janeiro and the regency give the good reason to expect should have place buenos|aires in the list of south|american power in respect to which nothing of importance affect be to be communicate but for occurrence which have lately take place at the|falkland|island in which the name of that republic have be use to cover with a show of authority act injurious to commerce and to the property and liberty of fellow citizen in the course of the|present|year|one of vessel engage in the pursuit of a trade which have always enjoy without molestation have be capture by a band act as pretend under the authority of the government of have therefore give order for the dispatch of an armed vessel to join squadron in those sea and aid in afford all lawful protection to trade which shall be necessary and shall without delay send a minister to inquire into the nature of the circumstance and also of the claim if any that be set up by that government to those island in the mean time submit the case to the consideration of congress to the end that may clothe the executive with such authority and mean as may deem necessary for provide a force adequate to the complete protection of fellow citizen fish and trading in those sea this rapid sketch of foreign relation be hope fellow citizen may be of some use in so much of legislation as may bear on that important subject while afford to the country at large a source of high gratification in the contemplation of political and commercial connection with the rest of the world at peace with all have subject of future difference with few and those susceptible of easy adjustment extend commerce gradually on all side and on none by any but the most liberal and mutually beneficial mean may by the blessing of providence hope for all that national prosperity which can be derive from an intercourse with foreign nation guide by those eternal principle of justice and reciprocal good will which be bind as well upon state as the individual of whom be compose have great satisfaction in make this statement of affair because the course of national policy enable to do without any indiscreet exposure of what in other government be usually conceal from the people have none but a straight forward open course to pursue guide by a single principle that will bear the strong light have happily no political combination to form no alliance to entangle no complicated interest to consult and in subject all have do to the consideration of citizen and to the inspection of the world give no advantage to other nation and lie open to no injury may not be improper to add that to preserve this state of thing and give confidence to the world in the integrity of design all consular and diplomatic agent be strictly enjoin to examine well every cause of complaint prefer by citizen and while urge with proper earnestness those that be well found to countenance none that be unreasonable or unjust and to enjoin on merchant and navigator the strict obedience to the law of the country to which resort and a course of conduct in dealing that may support the character of nation and render respect abroad connect with this subject must recommend a revisal of consular law defect and omission have be discover in operation that ought to be remedie and supply for further information on this subject have direct a report to be make by the secretary of state which shall hereafter submit to consideration the internal peace and security of confederate state be the next principal object of the general government time and experience have prove that the abode of the native indian within limit be dangerous to peace and injurious to in accordance with recommendation at a former session of congress an appropriation of be make to aid the voluntary removal of the various tribe beyond the limit of the state at the last session have the happiness to announce that the chickasaws and choctaws have accept the generous offer of the government and agree to remove beyond the|mississippi|river by which the whole of the state of mississippi and the western part of alabama will be free from indian occupancy and open to a civilized population the treaty with these tribe be in a course of execution and removal be hope will be complete in the course of at the request of the authority of georgia the registration of cherokee|indians for emigration have be resume and be confidently expect that half if not third of that tribe will follow the wise example of more westerly brother those who prefer remain at present home will hereafter be govern by the law of georgia as all citizen be and cease to be the object of peculiar care on the part of the general government during the|present|year the attention of the government have be particularly direct to those tribe in the powerful and grow state of ohio where considerable tract of the fine land be still occupy by the aboriginal proprietor treaty either absolute or conditional have be make extinguish the whole indian title to the reservation in that state and the time be not distant be hope when ohio will be no longer embarrassed with the indian population the same measure will be extend to indiana as soon as there be reason to anticipate success be confidently believe that perseverance for a|few|year in the present policy of the government will extinguish the indian title to all land lie within the state compose federal union and remove beyond limit every indian who be not willing to submit to law thus will all conflict claim to jurisdiction between the state and the indian tribe be put to rest be pleasing to reflect that result so beneficial not only to the state immediately concern but to the harmony of the union will have be accomplish by measure equally advantageous to the indians what the native savage become when surround by a dense population and by mix with the white may be see in the miserable remnant of a few eastern tribe deprive of political and civil right forbid to make contract and subject to guardian drag out a wretched existence without excitement without hope and almost without thought but the removal of the indians beyond the limit and jurisdiction of the state do not place beyond the reach of philanthropic aid and christian instruction on the contrary those whom philanthropy or religion may induce to live among in new abode will be more free in the exercise of benevolent function than if have remain within the limit of the state embarrass by internal regulation now subject to no control but the superintending agency of the general government exercise with the sole view of preserve peace may proceed unmolested in the interesting experiment of gradually advance a community of american indians from barbarism to the habit and enjoyment of civilized life among the happy effect of the improve relation of republic have be an increase of trade produce a corresponding increase of revenue beyond the most sanguine anticipation of the|treasury|department the state of the public finance will be fully show by the secretary of the treasury in the report which will presently lay before will here however congratulate upon prosperous condition the revenue receive in the|present|year will not fall short of and the expenditure for all object other than the public debt will not exceed the payment on account of the principal and interest of the debt during the|year will exceed a great sum than have be apply to that object out of the revenue in any|year since the enlargement of the sinking fund except the|two|year follow immediately there after the amount which will have be apply to the public debt from to which be less|than|three|year since the administration have be place in hand will exceed from the large importation of the|present|year may be safely estimate that the revenue which will be receive into the treasury from that source during the|next|year with the aid of that receive from the public land will considerably exceed the amount of the receipt of the|present|year and be believe that with the mean which the government will have at disposal from various source which will be fully state by the proper department the whole of the public debt may be extinguish either by redemption or purchase within the|four|year of administration shall then exhibit the rare example of a great nation abound in all the mean of happiness and security altogether free from debt the confidence with which the extinguishment of the public debt may be anticipate present an opportunity for carry into effect more fully the policy in relation to import duty which have be recommend in former message a modification of the tariff which shall produce a reduction of revenue to the want of the government and an adjustment of the duty on import with a view to equal justice in relation to all national interest and to the counteraction of foreign policy so far as may be injurious to those interest be deem to be of the principal object which demand the consideration of the present congress justice to the interest of the merchant as well as the manufacturer require that material reduction in the import duty be prospective and unless the present congress shall dispose of the subject the propose reduction can not properly be make to take effect at the period when the necessity for the revenue arise from present rate shall cease be therefore desirable that arrangement be adopt at present session to relieve the people from unnecessary taxation after the extinguishment of the public debt in the exercise of that spirit of concession and conciliation which have distinguish the friend of union in all great emergency be believe that this object may be effect without injury to any national interest in annual message of have the honor to recommend the adoption of a more liberal policy than that which then prevail toward unfortunate debtor to the government and deem duty again to invite attention to this subject actuate by similar view congress at last session pass an act for the relief of certain insolvent debtor of the|united|state but the provision of that law have not be deem such as be adequate to that relief to this unfortunate class of fellow citizen which may be safely extend to the point in which the law appear to be defective will be particularly communicate by the secretary of the treasury and take pleasure in recommend such an extension of provision as will unfetter the enterprise of a valuable portion of citizen and restore to the mean of usefulness to and the community while deliberate on this subject would also recommend to consideration the propriety of so modify the law for enforce the payment of debt due either to the public or to individual sue in the court of the|united|state as to restrict the imprisonment of the person to case of fraudulent concealment of property the personal liberty of the citizen seem too sacred to be hold as in many case now be at the will of a creditor to whom be willing to surrender all the mean have of discharge debt the report from the|secretaries|of|the|war|and|navy|department and from the|postmaster|general which accompany this message present satisfactory view of the operation of the department respectively under charge and suggest improvement which be worthy of and to which invite the serious attention of congress certain defect and omission have be discover in the operation of the law respect patent be point out in the accompanying report from the secretary of state have heretofore recommend amendment of the federal constitution give the election of president and vice president to the people and limit the service of the former to a single term so important do consider these change in fundamental law that can not in accordance with sense of duty omit to press upon the consideration of a new congress for view more at large as well in relation to these point as to the disqualification of member of congress to receive an office from a president in whose election have have an official agency which propose as a substitute refer to former message system of public account be extremely complicated and be believe may be much improve much of the present machinery and a considerable portion of the expenditure of public money may be dispense with while great facility can be afford to the liquidation of claim upon the government and an examination into justice and legality quite as efficient as the present secure with a view to a general reform in the system recommend the subject to the attention of congress deem duty again to call attention to the condition of be doubtless wise in the framer of constitution to place the people of this district under the jurisdiction of the general government but to accomplish the object have in view be not necessary that this people should be deprive of all the privilege of self government independently of the difficulty of induce the representative of distant state to turn attention to project of law which be not of the high interest to constituent be not individually nor in congress collectively well qualified to legislate over the local concern of this district consequently interest be much neglect and the people be almost afraid to present grievance lest a body in which be not represent and which feel little sympathy in local relation should in attempt to make law for do more harm than good govern by the law of the state whence be sever the shore of the potomac within the|10|miles square have different penal code not the present code of virginia and maryland but such as exist in those state at the time of the cession to the|united|state as congress will not form a new code and as the people of the district can not make for be virtually under government be not just to allow at least a delegate in congress if not a local legislature to make law for the district subject to the approval or rejection of congress earnestly recommend the extension to of every political right which interest require and which may be compatible with the constitution the extension of the judiciary system of the|united|state be deem to be of the duty of the government fourth of the states in the union do not participate in the benefit of a circuit court to the state of indiana illinois missouri alabama mississippi and louisiana admit into the union since the present judicial system be organize only a district court have be allow if this be sufficient then the circuit court already exist in state ought to be abolish if be not sufficient the defect ought to be remedie and these state place on the same footing with the other member of the union be on this condition and on this footing that enter the union and may demand circuit court as a matter not of concession but of right trust that congress will not adjourn leave this anomaly in system entertain the opinion heretofore express in relation to the|bank|of|the|united|state as at present organize feel duty in former message frankly to disclose in order that the attention of the legislature and the people should be seasonably direct to that important subject and that may be consider and finally dispose of in a manner best calculate to promote the end of the constitution and subserve the public interest have thus conscientiously discharge a constitutional duty deem proper on this occasion without a more particular reference to the view of the subject then express to leave for the present to the investigation of an enlightened people and representative in conclusion permit to invoke that power which superintend all government to infuse into deliberation at this important crisis of history a spirit of mutual forbearance and conciliation in that spirit be union form and in that spirit must be preserve transcript to the senate of the|united|state have receive resolution of the 15th instant request to inform the senate whether the provision of the act entitle an act to regulate trade and intercourse with the indian tribe and to preserve peace on the frontier pass the|30th|of|march,|1802 have be fully comply with on the part of the|united|states|government and if have not that inform the senate of the reason that have induce the government to decline the enforcement of say act and now reply to the same accord to view of the act refer to be not aware of any omission to carry into effect provision in relation to trade and intercourse with the indian tribe so far as execution depend on the agency confide to the executive the numerous provision of that act design to secure to the indians the peaceable possession of land may be reduce substantially to the follow that citizen of the|united|state be restrain under sufficient penalty from enter upon the land for the purpose of hunt thereon or of settle or of give horse and cattle the benefit of a range upon or of travel through without a write permission and that the president of the|united|state be authorize to employ the military force of the country to secure the observance of these provision the authority to the president however be not imperative the language be shall be lawful for the president to take such measure and to employ such military force as may judge necessary to remove from land belong to or secure by treaty to any indian tribe any citizen who shall make a settlement thereon by the nineteenth section of this act be provide that nothing in shall be construe to prevent any trade or intercourse with indians live on land surround by settlement of citizen of the|united|state and be within the ordinary jurisdiction of any of the individual states this provision have interpret as be prospective in operation and as applicable not only to indian tribe which at the date of passage be subject to the jurisdiction of any state but to such also as should thereafter become so to this construction of meaning have endeavor to conform and have take no step inconsistent with as soon therefore as the sovereign power of the|state of georgia be exercise by an extension of law throughout limit and have receive information of the same order be give to withdraw from the state the troop which have be detail to prevent intrusion upon the indian land within and these order be execute the reason which dictate shall be frankly communicate the principle recognize in the section last quote be not for the first time then avow be conformable to the uniform practice of the government before the adoption of the constitution and amount to a distinct recognition by congress at that early day of the doctrine that that instrument have not vary the power of the|federal|government over indian affair from what be under the|articles|of|confederation be not believe that there be a single instance in the legislation of the country in which the indians have be regard as possess political right independent of the control and authority of the states within the limit of which reside the journals of congress will show that no claim of such a character be countenance by that body in that|year the application of a tribe of indians reside in south|carolina to have certain tract of land which have be reserve for use in that state secure to free from intrusion and without the right of alienate even with own consent be bring to the consideration of congress by a report from the secretary of war the resolution which be adopt on that occasion be as follow resolve that be recommend to the legislature of south|carolina to take such measure for the satisfaction and security of say tribe as the say legislature in wisdom may think fit here be no assertion of the right of congress under the|articles|of|confederation to interfere with the jurisdiction of the states over indians within limit but rather a negation of refuse to interfere with the subject and refer under a general recommendation back to the state to be dispose of as wisdom may decide if in addition to this act and the language of the|articles|of|confederation anything further can be want to show the early view of the government on the subject will be find in the proclamation issue by congress in contain this language the|united|state in congress assemble have think proper to issue proclamation and do hereby prohibit and forbid all person front make settlement on land inhabit or claim by indians without the limit or jurisdiction of any particular state and again resolve that the precede measure of congress relative to indian affair shall not be construe to affect the territorial claim of any of the states or legislative right within respective limit be not then pretend that the|general|government have the power in relation with the indians to control or oppose the internal polity of the individual states of this union and if such be the case under the|articles|of|confederation the only question on the subject since must arise out of some more enlarged power or authority give to the|general|government by the present constitution do any such exist amongst the enumerate grant of the constitution that which relate to this subject be express in these word congress shall have power to regulate commerce with the indian tribe in the interpretation of this power ought certainly to be guide by what have be the practice of the government and the meaning which have be generally attach to the resolve of the old congress if the word use to convey do not clearly import a different one as far as affect the question of jurisdiction in the individual states the states ought not to be divest of any part of antecedent jurisdiction by implication or doubtful construction test by this rule seem to to be unquestionable that the jurisdiction of the states be leave untouched by this clause of the constitution and that be design to give to complete control over the trade and intercourse of those indians only who be not within the limit of any state from a view of the act refer to and the uniform practice of the government be manifest that until recently have never be maintain that the right of jurisdiction by a state over indians within territory be subordinate to the power of the|federal|government that doctrine have not be enforce nor even assert in any of the|states|of|new|england where tribe of indians have reside and where a few of yet remain these tribe have be leave to the undisturbed control of the states in which be find in conformity with the view which have be take of the opinion prevail up to and the clear interpretation of the act of in the|state|of|new|york where several tribe have reside have be the policy of the government to avoid enter into quasi treaty engagement with barely appoint commissioner occasionally on the part of the|united|state to facilitate the object of the state in negotiation with the southern|states present an exception to this policy as early as the settlement within the limit of north|carolina be advance farther to the west than the authority of the state to enforce an obedience of law other be in a similar condition the necessity therefore and not the acknowledge principle of the government must have suggest the policy of treat with the indians in that|quarter as the only practicable mode of conciliate good will the|united|state at that period have just emerge from a protract war for the achievement of independence at the moment of conclusion many of these tribe as powerful as be ferocious in mode of warfare remain in arm desolate frontier settlement under these circumstance the first treaty in and with the cherokees be conclude by and be evidently sanction as measure of necessity adapt to the character of the indians and indispensable to the peace and security of the western frontier but can not be understand as change the political relation of the indians to the states or to to effect this would have require the operation of quite a different principle and the intervention of a tribunal high than that of the treaty make power to infer from the assent of the government to this deviation from the practice which have before govern intercourse with the indians and the accidental forbearance of the states to assert right of jurisdiction over that have surrender this portion of sovereignty and that assumption now be usurpation be concede too much to the necessity which dictate those treaty and do violence to the principle of the government and the right of the states without benefit in the least degree the indians the indians thus situate can not be regard in any other light than as member of a foreign government or of that of the state within whose charter limit reside if in the former the ordinary legislation of congress in relation to be not warrant by the constitution which be establish for the benefit of own not of a foreign people if in the latter then like other citizen or people resident within the limit of the states be subject to jurisdiction and control to maintain a contrary doctrine and to require the executive to enforce by the employment of a military force would be to place in hand a power to make war upon the right of the states and the liberty of the country a power which should be place in the hand of no individual if indeed the indians be to be regard as people possess right which can exercise independently of the states much error have arise in the intercourse of the government with why be that have be call upon to assist in war without the privilege of exercise own discretion if an independent people should as such be consult and advise with but have not be in an order which be issue to from in september,|1814 this language be employ all the friendly indians should be organize and prepare to cooperate with other force there appear to be some dissatisfaction among the choctaws friendship and service should be secure without delay the friendly indians must be feed and pay and make to fight when and where service may be require to an independent and foreign people this would seem to be assume should suppose rather too lofty a tone which the government would not have assume if have consider in that light again by the constitution the power of declare war belong exclusively to congress have be often engage in war with the indian tribe within limit but when have these hostility be precede or accompany by an act of congress declare war against the tribe which be the object of and be the prosecution of such hostility an usurpation in each case by the executive which conduct of the constitutional power of congress must have be so apprehend if these tribe be to be consider as foreign and independent nation the step take to prevent intrusion upon indian land have origin with the commencement of government and become the subject of special legislation in with the reservation which have be mention in favor of the jurisdiction of the|state with the exception of south|carolina who have uniformly regulate the indians within limit without the aid of the|general|government have be feel within all the states of the south without be understand to affect right or prevent the exercise of jurisdiction whenever be in a situation to assume and enforce georgia though materially concern have on this principle forborne to spread legislation farther than the settlement of own white citizen until have recently perceive within limit a people claim to be capable of self government sit in legislative council organize court and administer justice to disarm such an anomalous invasion of sovereignty have declare determination to execute own law throughout limit a step which seem to have be anticipate by the proclamation of and which be perfectly consistent with the nineteenth section of the|act|of|1802 accord to the language and reasoning of that section the tribe to the south and the southwest be not only surround by settlement of the citizen of the|united|state but be now also within the ordinary jurisdiction of the individual states become so from the moment the law of the state be extend over and the same result follow the similar determination of alabama and mississippi these|states have each a right to claim in behalf of position now on this question the same respect which be concede to the other states of the union toward this race of people entertain the kind feeling and be not sensible that the view which have take of true interest be less favorable to than those which oppose emigration to the west year since state to belief that if the states choose to extend law over would not be in the power of the|federal|government to prevent opinion remain the same and can see no alternative for but that of removal to the west or a quiet submission to the state law if prefer to remove the|united|state agree to defray expense to supply the mean of transportation and a year 's support after reach new home a provision too liberal and kind to deserve the stamp of injustice either course promise peace and happiness whilst an obstinate perseverance in the effort to maintain possession independent of the state authority can not fail to render condition still more helpless and miserable such an effort ought therefore to be discountenance by all who sincerely sympathize in the fortune of this peculiar people and especially by the political body of the union as calculate to disturb the harmony of the governments and to endanger the safety of the many blessing which enable to enjoy as connect with the subject of this inquiry beg leave to refer to the accompanying letter from the secretary of war inclose the order which proceed from that department and a letter from the governor of georgia transcript fellow citizen of the senate and house|of|representatif the pleasure have in congratulate upon return to constitutional duty be much heighten by the satisfaction which the condition of beloved country at this period justly inspire the beneficent author of all good have grant to during the|present|year health peace and plenty and numerous cause for joy in the wonderful success which attend the progress of free institution with a population unparallele in increase and possess a character which combine the hardihood of enterprise with the considerateness of wisdom see in every section of happy country a steady improvement in the mean of social intercourse and correspondent effect upon the genius and law of extended republic the apparent exception to the harmony of the prospect be to be refer rather to inevitable diversity in the various interest which enter into the composition of so extensive a whole than any want of attachment to the union interest whose collision serve only in the end to foster the spirit of conciliation and patriotism so essential to the preservation of that union which most devoutly hope be destine to prove imperishable in the midst of these blessing have recently witness change in the condition of other nation which may in consequence call for the utmost vigilance wisdom and unanimity in council and the exercise of all the moderation and patriotism of people the important modification of government effect with so much courage and wisdom by the people of france afford a happy presage of future course and have naturally elicit from the kindre feeling of this nation that spontaneous and universal burst of applause in which have participate in congratulate fellow citizen upon an event so auspicious to the dear interest of mankind do no more than respond to the voice of country without transcend in the slight degree that salutary maxim of the illustrious washington which enjoin an abstinence from all interference with the internal affair of other nation from a people exercise in the most unlimited degree the right of self government and enjoy as derive from this proud characteristic under the favor of heaven much of the happiness with which be bless a people who can point in triumph to free institution and challenge comparison with the fruit bear as well as with the moderation intelligence and energy with which be administer from such a people the deep sympathy be to be expect in a struggle for the sacred principle of liberty conduct in a spirit every way worthy of the cause and crown by a heroic moderation which have disarm revolution of terror not withstand the strong assurance which the man whom so sincerely love and justly admire have give to the world of the high character of the present king of the french and which if sustain to the end will secure to the proud appellation of patriot|king be not in success but in that of the great principle which have bear to the throne the paramount authority of the public will — that the american people rejoice be happy to inform that the anticipation which be indulge at the date of last communication on the subject of foreign affair have be fully realize in several important particular an arrangement have be effect with great|britain in relation to the trade between the|united|state and west|india and north|american colony which have settle a question that have for year afford matter for contention and almost uninterrupted discussion and have be the subject of no|less|than|six negotiation in a manner which promise result highly favorable to the party the abstract right of great|britain to monopolize the trade with colony or to exclude from a participation therein have never be deny by the|united|state but have contend and with reason that if at any time great|britain may desire the production of this country as necessary to colony must be receive upon principle of just reciprocity and further that be make an invidious and unfriendly distinction to open colonial port to the vessel of other nation and close against those of the|united|state antecedently to a portion of production be admit into the colonial island of by particular concession limit to the term of one|year but renew from in the transportation of these production however vessel be not allow to engage this be a privilege reserve to british shipping by which alone produce could be take to the island and bring to in return from newfoundland and continental possession all production as well as vessel be exclude with occasional relaxation by which in season of distress the former be admit in british bottom by the|treaty|of|1794 offer to concede to for a limited time the right of carry to west|india possession in vessel not exceed 70|ton burthen and upon the same term as british vessel any production of the|united|state which british vessel may import therefrom but this privilege be couple with condition which be suppose to have lead to rejection by the senate that is that american vessel should land return cargo in the|united|state only and moreover that should during the continuance of the privilege be preclude from carry molasse sugar coffee cocoa or cotton either from those island or from the|united|state to any other part of the world great|britain readily consent to expunge this article from the treaty and subsequent attempt to arrange the term of the trade either by treaty stipulation or concert legislation have fail have be successively suspend and allow accord to the varying legislation of the party the follow be the prominent point which have in later|years separate the government besides a restriction whereby all importation into colony in american vessel be confine to own product carry hence a restriction to which do not appear that have ever object a lead object on the part of great|britain have be to prevent from become the carrier of british west|india commodity to any other country than own on the part of the|united|state have be contend first that the subject should be regulate by treaty stipulation in preference to separate legislation that production when import into the colony in question should not be subject to high duty than the production of the mother country or of other colonial possession and third that vessel should be allow to participate in the circuitous trade between the|united|state and different part of the british dominion the first point after have be for a long time strenuously insist upon by great|britain be give up by the act of parliament of 1825- all vessel suffer to trade with the colony be permit to clear from thence with any article which british vessel may export and proceed to any part of the world great|britain and dependency alone except on part each of the above point have in succession be explicitly abandon in negotiation precede that of which the result be now announce this arrangement secure to the|united|state every advantage ask by and which the state of the negotiation allow to insist upon the trade will be place upon a footing decidedly more favorable to this country than any on which ever stand and commerce and navigation will enjoy in the colonial port of great|britain every privilege allow to other nation that the prosperity of the country so far as depend on this trade will be greatly promote by the new arrangement there can be no doubt independently of the more obvious advantage of an open and direct intercourse establishment will be attend with other consequence of a high value that which have be carry on since the mutual interdict under all the expense and inconvenience unavoidably incident to would have be insupportably onerous have not be in a great degree lighten by concerted evasion in the mode of make the transshipment at what be call the neutral port these indirection be inconsistent with the dignity of nation that have so many motif not only to cherish feeling of mutual friendship but to maintain such relation as will stimulate respective citizen and subject to effort of direct open and honorable competition only and preserve from the influence of seductive and vitiate circumstance when preliminary interposition be ask at the close of the last session a copy of the instruction under which mr. mclane have act together with the communication which have at that time pass between and the british government be lay before although there have not be any thing in the act of the government which require secrecy be think most proper in the then state of the negotiation to make that communication a confidential so soon however as the evidence of execution on the part of great|britain be receive the whole matter shall be lay before when will be see that the apprehension which appear to have suggest of the provision of the act pass at last session that the restoration of the trade in question may be connect with other subject and be seek to be obtain at the sacrifice of the public interest in other particular be wholly unfounded and that the change which have take place in the view of the british government have be induce by consideration as honorable to both party as trust the result will prove beneficial this desirable result be will be see greatly promote by the liberal and confide provision of the act of congress of the last session by which port be upon the reception and annunciation by the president of the require assurance on the part of great|britain forthwith open to vessel before the arrangement could be carry into effect on part pursue in this act of prospective legislation a similar course to that adopt by great|britain in abolishing by act of parliament in a restriction then exist and permit vessel to clear from the colony on return voyage for any foreign country whatever before british vessel have be relieve from the restriction impose by law of return directly from the|united|state to the colony a restriction which require and expect that should abolish upon each occasion a limited and temporary advantage have be give to the opposite party but an advantage of no importance in comparison with the restoration of mutual confidence and good feeling and the ultimate establishment of the trade upon fair principle give unfeigned pleasure to assure that this negotiation have be throughout characterize by the most frank and friendly spirit on the part of great|britain and conclude in a manner strongly indicative of a sincere desire to cultivate the good relation with the|united|state to reciprocate this disposition to the full extent of ability be a duty which shall deem a privilege to discharge although the result be the good commentary on the service render to country by minister at the|court|of|st.|james would be do violence to feeling be to dismiss the subject without express the very high sense entertain of the talent and exertion which have be display by on the occasion the injury to the commerce of the|united|state result from the exclusion of vessel from the|black|sea and the previous footing of mere sufferance upon which even the limited trade enjoy by with turkey have hitherto be place have for a long time be a source of much solicitude to this government and several endeavor have be make to obtain a well state of thing sensible of the importance of the object feel duty to leave no proper mean unemployed to acquire for flag the same privilege that be enjoy by the principal power of europe commissioner be consequently appoint to open a negotiation with not long after the member of the commission who go directly from the|united|state have sail the account of the treaty of adrianople by which of the object in view be suppose to be secure reach this country the|black|sea be understand to be open to under the supposition that this be the case the additional facility to be derive from the establishment of commercial regulation with the porte be deem of sufficient importance to require a prosecution of the negotiation as originally contemplate be therefore persevere in and result in a treaty which will be forthwith lay before the senate by provision a free passage be secure without limitation of time to the vessel of the|united|state to and from the|black|sea include the navigation thereof and trade with turkey be place on the footing of the most favor nation the latter be an arrangement wholly independent of the treaty of adrianople and the former derive much value not only from the increase security which under any circumstance would give to the right in question but from the fact ascertain in the course of the negotiation that by the construction put upon that treaty by turkey the article relate to the passage of the bosphorus be confine to nation have treaty with the porte the most friendly feeling appear to be entertain by the sultan and an enlighten disposition be evince by to foster the intercourse between the country by the most liberal arrangement this disposition will be duty and interest to cherish relation with russia be of the most stable character respect for that empire and confidence in friendship toward the|united|state have be so long entertain on part and so carefully cherish by the present emperor and illustrious predecessor as to have become incorporate with the public sentiment of the|united|state no means will be leave unemployed on part to promote these salutary feeling and those improvement of which the commercial intercourse between the country be susceptible and which have derive increase importance from treaty with sincerely regret to inform that minister lately commission to that court on whose distinguished talent and great experience in public affair place great reliance have be compel by extreme indisposition to exercise a privilege which in consideration of the extent to which constitution have be impair in the public service be commit to discretion of leave temporarily post for the advantage of a more genial climate if as be to be hope the improvement of health should be such as to justify in do so will repair to st.|petersburg and resume the discharge of official duty have receive the most satisfactory assurance that in the mean time the public interest in that|quarter will be preserve from prejudice by the intercourse which will continue through the secretary of legation with the russian cabinet be apprise although the fact have not yet be officially announce to the|house|of|representatives that a treaty be in the|month|of|march last conclude between the|united|state and denmark by which be secure to citizen as an indemnity for spoliation upon commerce in the|years|1808,|1809,|1810 and this treaty be sanction by the senate at the close of last session and now become the duty of congress to pass the necessary law for the organization of the board of commissioner to distribute the indemnity among the claimant be an agreeable circumstance in this adjustment that the term be in conformity with the previously ascertain view of the claimant thus remove all pretense for a future agitation of the subject in any form the negotiation in regard to such point in foreign relation as remain to be adjust have be actively prosecute during the recess material advance have be make which be of a character to promise favorable result country by the blessing of god be not in a situation to invite aggression and will be fault if ever become so sincerely desirous to cultivate the most liberal and friendly relation with all ever ready to fulfill engagement with scrupulous fidelity limit demand upon other to mere justice hold ever ready to do unto as would wish to be do by and avoid even the appearance of undue partiality to any nation appear to impossible that a simple and sincere application of principle to foreign relation can fail to place ultimately upon the footing on which be wish should rest of the point refer to the most prominent be claim upon france for spoliation upon commerce similar claim upon spain together with embarrassment in the commercial intercourse between the country which ought to be remove the conclusion of the treaty of commerce and navigation with mexico which have be so long in suspense as well as the final settlement of limit between and that republic and finally the arbitrament of the question between the|united|state and great|britain in regard to the northeastern boundary the negotiation with france have be conduct by minister with zeal and ability and in all respect to entire satisfaction although the prospect of a favorable termination be occasionally dim by counter pretension to which the|united|state could not assent yet have strong hope of be able to arrive at a satisfactory settlement with the late government the negotiation have be renew with the present authority and sensible of the general and lively confidence of citizen in the justice and magnanimity of regenerated france regret the more not to have in power yet to announce the result so confidently anticipate no ground however inconsistent with this expectation have yet be take and do not allow to doubt that justice will soon be do the amount of the claim the length of time have remain unsatisfied and incontrovertible justice make an earnest prosecution of by this government an urgent duty the illegality of the seizure and confiscation out of which have arise be not dispute and what ever distinction may have heretofore be set up in regard to the liability of the exist government be quite clear that such consideration can not now be interpose the commercial intercourse between the country be susceptible of highly advantageous improvement but the sense of this injury have have and must continue to have a very unfavorable influence upon from satisfactory adjustment not only a firm and cordial friendship but a progressive development of all relation may be expect be therefore earnest hope that this old and vexatious subject of difference may be speedily remove feel that confidence in appeal to the motif which should govern a just and magnanimous nation be alike warrant by the character of the french people and by the high voucher possess for the enlarged view and pure integrity of the monarch who now preside over council and nothing shall be want on part to meet any manifestation of the spirit anticipate in of correspond frankness and liberality the subject of difference with spain have be bring to the view of that government by minister there with much force and propriety and the strong assurance have be receive of early and favorable consideration be particularly gratify in be able to state that a decidedly favorable and as hope last change have be effect in relation with the neighboring republic of mexico the unfortunate and unfounded suspicion in regard to disposition which become painful duty to advert to on a former occasion have be believe entirely remove and the government of mexico have be make to understand the real character of the wish and view of this in regard to that country the consequence be the establishment of friendship and mutual confidence such be the assurance have receive and see no cause to doubt sincerity have reason to expect the conclusion of a commercial treaty with mexico in season for communication on the present occasion circumstance which be not explain but which be persuade be not the result of an indisposition on part to enter into have produce the delay there be reason to fear in the course of the|last|summer that the harmony of relation may be disturb by the act of certain claimant under mexican grant of territory which have hitherto be under jurisdiction the cooperation of the representative of mexico near this government be ask on the occasion and be readily afford instruction and advice have be give to the governor of arkansas and the officer in command in the adjoin mexican state by which be hope the quiet of that frontier will be preserve until a final settlement of the dividing line shall have remove all ground of controversy the exchange of ratification of the treaty conclude last|year with austria have not yet take place the delay have be occasion by the non - arrival of the ratification of that government within the time prescribe by the treaty renew authority have be ask for by the representative of austria and in the mean time the rapidly increase trade and navigation between the country have be place upon the most liberal footing of navigation act several allege depredation have be recently commit on commerce by the national vessel of portugal have be make the subject of immediate remonstrance and reclamation be not yet possess of sufficient information to express a definitive opinion of character but expect soon to receive no proper mean shall be omit to obtain for citizen all the redress to which may appear to be entitle almost at the moment of the adjournment of last session bill the one entitle an act for make appropriation for build light house light boat beacon and monument place buoy and for improve harbor and directing survey and the other an act to authorize a subscription for stock in the louisville and portland|canal|company"—were submit for approval be not possible within the time allow for before the close of the session to give to these bill the consideration which be due to character and importance and be compel to retain for that purpose now avail of this early opportunity to return to the houses in which respectively originate with the reason which after mature deliberation compel to withhold approval the practice of defray out of the treasury of the|united|state the expense incur by the establishment and support of light house beacon buoy and public pier within the bay inlet harbor and port of the|united|state to render the navigation thereof safe and easy be coeval with the adoption of the constitution and have be continue without interruption or dispute as foreign commerce increase and be extend into the interior of the country by the establishment of port of entry and delivery upon navigable river the sphere of those expenditure receive a corresponding enlargement light house beacon buoy public pier and the removal of sand bar sawyer and other partial or temporary impediment in the navigable river and harbor which be embrace in the revenue district from time to time establish by law be authorize upon the same principle and the expense defray in the same manner that these expense have at time be extravagant and disproportionate be very probable the circumstance under which be incur be well calculated to lead to such a result unless application be subject to the close scrutiny the local advantage arise from the disbursement of public money too frequently be to be fear invite appropriation for object of this character that be neither necessary nor useful the number of light house keeper be already very large and the bill before propose to add to more of various description from representation upon the subject which be understand to be entitle to respect be induce to believe that there have not only be great improvidence in the past expenditure of the government upon these object but that the security of navigation have in some instance be diminish by the multiplication of light house and consequent change of light upon the coast be in this as in other respect duty to avoid all unnecessary expense as well as every increase of patronage not call for by the public service but in the discharge of that duty in this particular must not be forget that in relation to foreign commerce the burden and benefit of protect and accommodate necessarily go together and must do so as long as the public revenue be draw from the people through the custom house be indisputable that whatever give facility and security to navigation cheapen import and all who consume be alike interested in what ever produce this effect if consume ought as now do to pay otherwise do not pay the consumer in the most inland state derive the same advantage from every necessary and prudent expenditure for the facility and security of foreign commerce and navigation that do who reside in a maritime state local expenditure have not of a corresponding operation from a bill make direct appropriation for such object should not have withhold assent the one now return do so in several particular but also contain appropriation for survey of local character which can not approve give satisfaction to find that no serious inconvenience have arise from withhold approval from this bill nor will trust be cause of regret that an opportunity will be thereby afford for congress to review provision under circumstance better calculate for full investigation than those under which be pass in speaking of direct appropriation mean not to include a practice which have obtain to some extent and to which have in instance in a different capacity give assent that of subscribe to the stock of private association positive experience and a more thorough consideration of the subject have convince of the impropriety as well as inexpediency of such investment all improvement effect by the fund of the nation for general use should be open to the enjoyment of all fellow citizen exempt from the payment of toll or any imposition of that character the practice of thus mingle the concern of the government with those of the state or of individual be inconsistent with the object of institution and highly impolite the successful operation of the federal system can only be preserve by confine to the few and simple but yet important object for which be design a different practice if allow to progress would ultimately change the character of this government by consolidate into the general and state government which be intend to be keep for ever distinct can not perceive how bill authorize such subscription can be otherwise regard than as bill for revenue and consequently subject to the rule in that respect prescribe by the constitution if the interest of the government in private company be subordinate to that of individual the management and control of a portion of the public fund be delegate to an authority unknown to the constitution and beyond the supervision of constituent if superior officer and agent will be constantly expose to imputation of favoritism and oppression direct prejudice the public interest or an alienation of the affection and respect of portion of the people may therefore in addition to the general discredit result to the government from embark with constituent in pecuniary stipulation be look for as the probable fruit of such association be no answer to this objection to say that the extent of consequence like these can not be great from a limited and small number of investment because experience in other matter teach and be not at liberty to disregard admonition that unless an entire stop be put to will soon be impossible to prevent accumulation until be spread over the whole country and make to embrace many of the private and appropriate concern of individual the power which the general government would acquire within the several state by become the principal stockholder in corporation control every canal and each of every important road and give a proportionate vote in all election be almost inconceivable and in view dangerous to the liberty of the people this mode of aid such work be also in nature deceptive and in many case conducive to improvidence in the administration of the national fund appropriation will be obtain with much great facility and grant with less security to the public interest when the measure be thus disguise than when definite and direct expenditure of money be ask for the interest of the nation would doubtless be better serve by avoid all such indirect mode of aid particular object in a government like more especially should all public act be as far as practicable simple undisguised and intelligible that may become fit subject for the approbation to animadversion of the people the bill authorize a subscription to the louisville and portland|canal afford a striking illustration of the difficulty of withhold additional appropriation for the same object when the first erroneous step have be take by institute a partnership between the government and private company propose a third subscription on the part of the|united|state when each precede be at the time regard as the extent of the aid which government be to render to that work and the accompanying bill for light house contain an appropriation for a survey of the bed of the river with a view to improvement by remove the obstruction which the canal be design to avoid this improvement if successful would afford a free passage of the river and render the canal entirely useless to such improvidence be the course of legislation subject in relation to internal improvement on local matter even with the good intention on the part of congress although the motif which have influence in this matter may be already sufficiently state be never the less induce by importance to add a few observation of a general character in objection to the bill authorize subscription to the maysville and rockville road company express view fully in regard to the power of congress to construct road and canal within a state of to appropriate money for improvement of a local character at the same time intimate belief that the right to make appropriation for such as be of a national character have be so generally act upon and so long acquiesce in by the federal and state government and the constituent of each as to justify exercise on the ground of continued and uninterrupted usage but that be never the less highly expedient that appropriation even of that character should with the exception make at the time be defer until the national debt be pay and that in the mean while some general rule for the action of the government in that respect ought to be establish these suggestion be not necessary to the decision of the question then before and be readily admit intend to awake the attention and draw forth the opinion and observation of constituent upon a subject of the high importance to interest and destine to exert a powerful influence upon the future operation of political system know of no tribunal to which a public man in this country in a case of doubt and difficulty can appeal with great advantage or more propriety than the judgment of the people and although must necessarily in the discharge of official duty be govern by the dictate of own judgment have no desire to conceal anxious wish to conform as far as can to the view of those for whom act all irregular expression of public opinion be of necessity attend with some doubt as to accuracy but make full allowance on that account can not think deceive in believe that the act refer to as well as the suggestion which allow to make in relation to bearing upon the future operation of the government have be approve by the great body of the people that those whose immediate pecuniary interest be to be affect by propose expenditure should shrink from the application of a rule which prefer more general and remote interest to those which be personal and immediate be to be expect but even such objection must from the nature of population be but temporary in duration and if be otherwise course should be the same for the time be yet hope far distant when those intrust with power to be exercise for the good of the whole will consider either honest or wise to purchase local favor at the sacrifice of principle and general good so understand public sentiment and thoroughly satisfy that the good interest of common country imperiously require that the course which have recommend in this regard should be adopt have upon the most mature consideration determine to pursue be due to candor as well as to own feeling that should express the reluctance and anxiety which must at all time experience in exercise the undoubted right of the executive to withhold assent from bill on other ground than constitutionality that this right should not be exercise on slight occasion all will admit be only in matter of deep interest when the principle involved may be justly regard as next in importance to infraction of the constitution that such a step can be expect to meet with the approbation of the people such an occasion do conscientiously believe the present to be in the discharge of this delicate and highly responsible duty be sustain by the reflection that the exercise of this power have be deem consistent with the obligation of official duty by several of predecessor and by the persuasion too that what ever liberal institution may have to fear from the encroachment of executive power which have be every where the cause of so much strife and bloody contention but little danger be to be apprehend from a precedent by which that authority deny to the exercise of power that bring in train influence and patronage of great extent and thus exclude the operation of personal interest every where the bane of official trust derive too no small degree of satisfaction from the reflection that if have mistake the interest and wish of the people the constitution afford the mean of soon redress the error by select for the place favor have bestow upon a citizen whose opinion may accord with own trust in the mean time the interest of the nation will be save from prejudice by a rigid application of that portion of the public fund which may otherwise be apply to different object to that high of all obligation the payment of the public debt and an opportunity be afford for the adoption of some well rule for the operation of the government in this matter than any which have hitherto be act upon profoundly impressed with the importance of the subject not merely as relate to the general prosperity of the country but to the safety of the federal system can not avoid repeat earnest hope that all good citizen who take a proper interest in the success and harmony of admirable political institution and who be incapable of desire to convert an opposite state of thing into mean for the gratification of personal ambition will lay aside minor consideration and discard local prejudice unite honest exertion to establish some fix general principle which shall be calculate to effect the great extent of public good in regard to the subject of internal improvement and afford the least ground for sectional discontent the general ground of objection to local appropriation have be heretofore express and shall endeavor to avoid a repetition of what have be already urge the importance of sustain the state sovereignty as far as be consistent with the rightful action of the federal government and of preserve the great attainable harmony between will now only add an expression of conviction a conviction which every day 's experience serve to confirm — that the political creed which inculcate the pursuit of those great object as a paramount duty be the true faith and to which be mainly indebte for the present success of the entire system and to which must alone look for future stability that there be diversity in the interest of the different state which compose this extensive confederacy must be admit those diversity arise from situation climate population and pursuit be doubtless as be natural should be greatly exaggerate by jealousy and that spirit of rivalry so inseparable from neighbor community these circumstance make the duty of those who be intrust with the management of affair to neutralize effect as far as practicable by make the beneficial operation of the federal government as equal and equitable among the several state as can be do consistently with the great end of institution be only necessary to refer to undoubted fact to see how far the past act of the government upon the subject under consideration have fall short of this object the expenditure heretofore make for internal improvement amount to upward of and have be distribute in very unequal proportion amongst the state the estimated expense of work of which survey have be make together with that of other project and partially survey amount to that such improvement on account of particular circumstance may be more advantageously and beneficially make in some state than in other be doubtless true but that be of a character which should prevent an equitable distribution of the fund amongst the several state be not to be concede the want of this equitable distribution can not fail to prove a prolific source of irritation among the state have constantly before eye that profession of superior zeal in the cause of internal improvement and a disposition to lavish the public fund upon object of this character be daily and earnestly put forth by aspirant to power as constitute the high claim to the confidence of the people would be strange under such circumstance and in time of great excitement that grant of this description should find motif in object which may not accord with the public good those who have not have occasion to see and regret the indication of a sinister influence in these matter in past time have be more fortunate than in observation of the course of public affair if to these evil be add the combination and angry contention to which such a course of thing give rise with baleful influence upon the legislation of congress touch the leading and appropriate duty of the federal government be but do justice to the character of people to expect the severe condemnation of the past which the recent exhibition of public sentiment have evince nothing short of a radical change in the action of the government upon the subject can in opinion remedy the evil if as would be natural to expect the state which have be least favor in past appropriation should insist on be redress in those here after to be make at the expense of the state which have so largely and disproportionately participate have as matter now stand but little security that the attempt would do more than change the inequality from one|quarter to another thus view the subject have heretofore feel duty to recommend the adoption of some plan for the distribution of the surplus fund which may at any time remain in the treasury after the national debt shall have be pay among the state in proportion to the number of representatives to be apply by to object of internal improvement although this plan have meet with favor in some portion of the union have also elicit objection which merit deliberate consideration a brief notice of these objection here will not therefore trust be regard as out of place rest as far as have come to knowledge on the follow ground first an objection to the ration of distribution an apprehension that the existence of such a regulation would produce improvident and oppressive taxation to raise the fund for distribution third that the mode propose would lead to the construction of work of a local nature to the exclusion of such as be general and as would consequently be of a more useful character and last that would create a discreditable and injurious dependence on the part of the state government upon the federal power of those who object to the ration of representative as the basis of distribution some insist that the importation of the respective state would constitute that would be more equitable and other again that the extent of respective territory would furnish a standard which would be more expedient and sufficiently equitable the ration of representation present to mind and still do as of obvious equity because of be the ratio of contribution whether the fund to be distribute be derive from the custom or from direct taxation do not follow however that adoption be indispensable to the establishment of the system propose there may be consideration appertain to the subject which would render a departure to some extent from the rule of contribution proper nor be absolutely necessary that the basis of distribution be confine to ground may if in the judgment of those whose right be to fix be deem politic and just to give that character have regard to several in first message state to be opinion that be not probably that any adjustment of the tariff upon principle satisfactory to the people of the union will until a remote period if ever leave the government without a considerable surplus in the treasury beyond what may be require for current surplus have have no cause to change that opinion but much to confirm should these expectation be realize a suitable fund would thus be produce for the plan under consideration to operate upon and if there be no such fund adoption will in opinion work no injury to any interest for can not assent to the justness of the apprehension that the establishment of the propose system would tend to the encouragement of improvident legislation of the character suppose what ever the proper authority in the exercise of constitutional power shall at any time here after decide to be for the general good will in that as in other respect deserve and receive the acquiescence and support of the whole country and have ample security that every abuse of power in that regard by agent of the people will receive a speedy and effectual corrective at hand the view which take of the future found on the obvious and increase improvement of all class of fellow citizen in intelligence and in public and private virtue leave without much apprehension on that head do not doubt that those who come after will be as much alive as be to the obligation upon all the trustee of political power to exempt those for whom act from all unnecessary burthen and as sensible of the great truth that the resource of the nation beyond those require for immediate and necessary purpose of government can no where be so well deposit as in the pocket of the people may some time happen that the interest of particular state would not be deem to coincide with the general interest in relation to improvement within such state but if the danger to be apprehend from this source be sufficient to require a discretion may be reserve to congress to direct to such improvement of a general character as the state concern may not be dispose to unite in the application of the quota of those state under the restriction of confine to each state the expenditure of appropriate quota may however be assume as a safe general rule that such improvement as serve to increase the prosperity of the respective state in which be make by give new facility to trade and thereby augment the wealth and comfort of inhabitant constitute the sure mode of confer permanent and substantial advantage upon the whole the strength as well as the true glory of the confederacy be found on the prosperity and power of the several independent sovereignty of which be compose and the certainty with which can be bring into successful active cooperation through the agency of the federal government be more over within the knowledge of such as be at all conversant with public affair that scheme of internal improvement have from time to time be propose which from extent and seem magnificence be readily regard as of national concernment but which upon full consideration and further experience would now be reject with great unanimity that the plan under consideration would derive important advantage from certainty and that the money set apart for these purpose would be more judiciously apply and economically expend under the direction of the state legislature in which every part of each state be immediately represent can not think be doubt in the new state particularly where a comparatively small population be scatter over an extensive surface and the representation in congress consequently very limited be natural to expect that the appropriation make by the federal government would be more likely to be expend in the vicinity of those number through whose immediate agency be obtain than if the fund be place under the control of the legislature in which every county of the state have own representative this supposition do not necessarily impugn the motif of such congressional representative nor be so intended be all sensible of the bias to which the strong mind and pure heart be under such circumstance liable in respect to the last objection probable effect upon the dignity and independence of state government — appear to only necessary to state the case as be and as would be if the measure propose be adopt to show that the operation be most likely to be the very reverse of that which the objection suppose in the case the state would receive quota of the national revenue for domestic use upon a fix principle as a matter of right and from a fund to the creation of which have contribute fair proportion surely there could be nothing derogatory in that as matter now stand the state in sovereign character be not unfrequently petitioner at the bar of the federal legislature for such allowance out of the national treasury as may comport with pleasure or sense of duty to bestow upon can not require argument to prove which of the course be most compatible with the efficiency or respectability of the state government but all these be matter for discussion and dispassionate consideration that the desire adjustment would be attend with difficulty afford no reason why should not be attempt the effective operation of such motif would have prevent the adoption of the constitution under which have so long live and under the benign influence of which beloved country have so signally prospered the framer of that sacred instrument have great difficulty to overcome and do overcome the patriotism of the people direct by a deep conviction of the importance of the union produce mutual concession and reciprocal forbearance strict right be merge in a spirit of compromise and the result have consecrate disintereste devotion to the general weal unless the american people have degenerate the same result can be again effect when ever experience point out the necessity of a resort to the same mean to uphold the fabric which father have rear be beyond the power of man to make a system of government like our or any other operate with precise equality upon state situate like those which compose this confederacy nor be inequality always injustice every state can not expect to shape the measure of the general government to suit own particular interest the cause which prevent be seat in the nature of thing and can not be entirely counteract by human mean mutual forbearance become therefore a duty obligatory upon all and may be confident count upon a cheerful compliance with this high injunction on the part of constituent be not to be suppose that will object to make such comparatively inconsiderable sacrifice for the preservation of right and privilege which other less favor portion of the world have in vain wade through sea of blood to acquire course be a safe one if be but faithfully adhere to acquiescence in the constitutionally express will of the majority and the exercise of that will in a spirit of moderation justice and brotherly kindness will constitute a cement which would for ever preserve union those who cherish and inculcate sentiment like these render a most essential service to country while those who seek to weaken influence be how ever conscientious and praise worthy intention in effect bad enemy if the intelligence and influence of the country instead of labor to foment sectional prejudice to be make subservient to party warfare be in good faith apply to the eradication of cause of local discontent by the improvement of institution and by facilitate adaptation to the condition of the time this task would prove of less difficulty may not hope that the obvious interest of common country and the dictate of an enlightened patriotism will in the end lead the public mind in that direction after all the nature of the subject do not admit of a plan wholly free from objection that which have for some time be in operation be perhaps the bad that could exist and every advance that can be make in improvement be a matter eminently worthy of most deliberate attention be very possible that better calculate to effect the object in view may yet be devise if so be to be hope that those who disapprove the past and dissent from what be propose for the future will feel duty to direct attention to as must be sensible that unless some fix rule for the action of the federal government in this respect be establish the course now attempt to be arrest will be again resort to any mode which be calculate to give the great degree of effect and harmony to legislation upon the subject which shall best serve to keep the movement of the federal government within the sphere intend by those who model and those who adopt which shall lead to the extinguishment of the national debt in the short period and impose the light burthen upon constituent shall receive from a cordial and firm support among the object of great national concern can not omit to press again upon attention that part of the constitution which regulate the election of president and vice president the necessity for amendment be make so clear to mind by observation of evil and by the many able discussion which have elicit on the floor of congress and elsewhere that should be want to duty be to withhold another expression of deep solicitude on the subject system fortunately contemplate a recurrence to first principle differ in this respect from all that have precede and secure trust equally against the decay and the commotion which have mark the progress of other government fellow citizen too who in proportion to love of liberty keep a steady eye upon the mean of sustain do not require to be remind of the duty owe to to remedy all essential defect in so vital a part of system while be sensible that every evil attendant upon operation be not necessarily indicative of a bad organization but may proceed from temporary cause yet the habitual presence or even a single instance of evil which can be clearly trace to an organic defect will not trust be overlook through a too scrupulous veneration for the work of ancestor the constitution be an experiment commit to the virtue and intelligence of the great mass of countryman in whose rank the framer of be to perform the part of patriotic observation and scrutiny and if have pass from the stage of existence with an increase confidence in general adaptation to condition should learn from authority so high the duty of fortify the point in which time prove to be expose rather than be deter from approach by the suggestion of fear or the dictate of misplace reverence a provision which do not secure to the people a direct choice of chief magistrate but have a tendency to defeat will present to mind such an inconsistence with the general spirit of institution that be indeed to suggest for consideration the substitute which appear to at the same time the most likely to correct the evil and to meet the view of constituent the most mature reflection since have add strength to the belief that the good interest of country require the speedy adoption of some plan calculate to effect this end a contingency which some time place in the power of a single member of the|house|of|representatives to decide an election of so high and solemn a character be unjust to the people and become when occur a source of embarrassment to the individual thus bring into power and a cause of distrust of the representative body liable as the confederacy be from great extent to party found upon sectional interest and to a corresponding multiplication of candidate for the presidency the tendency of the constitutional reference to the|house|of|representatives be to devolve the election upon that body in almost every instance and what ever choice may then be make among the candidate thus present to to swell the influence of particular interest to a degree inconsistent with the general good the consequence of this feature of the constitution appear far more threatening to the peace and integrity of the union than any which can conceive as likely to result from the simple legislative action of the federal government be a leading object with the framer of the constitution to keep as separate as possible the action of the legislative and executive branch of the government to secure this object nothing be more essential than to preserve the former from all temptation of private interest and therefore so to direct the patronage of the latter as not to permit such temptation to be offer experience abundantly demonstrate that every precaution in this respect be a valuable safeguard of liberty and one which reflection upon the tendency of system incline to think should be make still strong be for this reason that in connection with an amendment of the constitution remove all intermediate agency in the choice of the president recommend some restriction upon the re - eligibility of that officer and upon the tenure of office generally the reason still exist and renew the recommendation with an increase confidence that adoption will strengthen those check by which the constitution design to secure the independence of each department of the government and promote the healthful and equitable administration of all the trust which have create the agent most likely to contravene this design of the constitution be the chief magistrate in order particularly that appointment may as far as possible be place beyond the reach of any improper influence in order that may approach the solemn responsibility of the high office in the gift of a free people uncommitte to any other course than the strict line of constitutional duty and that the security for this independence may be render as strong as the nature of power and the weakness of possessor will admit can not too earnestly invite attention to the propriety of promote such an amendment of the constitution as will render ineligible after term of service give pleasure to announce to congress that the benevolent policy of the government steadily pursue for nearly|30|year in relation to the removal of the indians beyond the white settlement be approach to a happy consummation important tribe have accept the provision make for removal at the last session of congress and be believe that example will induce the remain tribe also to seek the same obvious advantage the consequence of a speedy removal will be important to the|united|state to individual state and to the indians the pecuniary advantage which promise to the government be the least of recommendation put an end to all possible danger of collision between the authority of the general and state government on account of the indians will place a dense and civilized population in large tract of country now occupy by a few savage hunter by open the whole territory between tennessee on the north and louisiana on the south to the settlement of the white will incalculably strengthen the sw frontier and render the adjacent state strong enough to repel future invasion without remote aid will relieve the whole state of mississippi and the western part of alabama of indian occupancy and enable those state to advance rapidly in population wealth and power will separate the indians from immediate contact with settlement of white free from the power of the state enable to pursue happiness in own way and under own rude institution will retard the progress of decay which be lessen number and perhaps cause gradually under the protection of the government and through the influence of good counsel to cast off savage habit and become an interesting civilized and christian community these consequence some of so certain and the rest so probable make the complete execution of the plan sanction by congress at last session an object of much solicitude toward the aborigine of the country no one can indulge a more friendly feeling than or would go further in attempt to reclaim from wandering habit and make a happy prosperous people have endeavor to impress upon own solemn conviction of the duty and power of the general government in relation to the state authority for the justice of the law pass by the state within the scope of reserve power be not responsible to this government as individual may entertain and express opinion of act but as a government have as little right to control as have to prescribe law for other nation with a full understanding of the subject the choctaw and the chickasaw tribe have with great unanimity determine to avail of the liberal offer present by the act of congress and have agree to remove beyond treaty have be make with which in due season will be submit for consideration in negotiate these treaty be make to understand true condition and have prefer maintain independence in the western forest to submit to the law of the state in which now reside these treaty be probably the last which will ever be make with be characterize by great liberality on the part of the government give the indians a liberal sum in consideration of removal and comfortable subsistence on arrival at new home if be real interest to maintain a separate existence will there be at liberty to do so without the inconvenience and vexation to which would unavoidably have be subject in alabama and mississippi humanity have often weep over the fate of the aborigine of this country and philanthropy have be long busily employ in devise mean to avert but progress have never for a moment be arrest and by have many powerful tribe disappear from the earth to follow to the tomb the last of race and to tread on the grave of extinct nation excite melancholy reflection but true philanthropy reconcile the mind to these vicissitude as do to the extinction of generation to make room for another in the monument and fortification of an unknown people spread over the extensive region of the west behold the memorial of a once powerful race which be exterminate of have disappear to make room for the exist savage tribe nor be there any thing in this which upon a comprehensive view of the general interest of the human race be to be regret philanthropy could not wish to see this continent restore to the condition in which be find by forefather what good man would prefer a country cover with forest and range by a|few|thousand savage to extensive republic stud with city town and prosperous farm embellish with all the improvement which art can devise or industry execute occupy by happy people and fill with all the blessing of liberty civilization and religion the present policy of the government be but a continuation of the same progressive change by a milder process the tribe which occupy the country now constitute the eastern state be annihilate or have melt away to make room for the white the wave of population and civilization be roll to the westward and now propose to acquire the country occupy by the red man of the south and west by a fair exchange and at the expense of the|united|state to send to a land where existence may be prolong and perhaps make perpetual doubtless will be painful to leave the grave of father but what do more than ancestor do or than child be now do to better condition in an unknown land forefather leave all that be dear in earthly object child by thousand yearly leave the land of birth to seek new home in distant region do humanity weep at these painful separation from every thing animate and inanimate with which the young heart have become entwine far from be rather a source of joy that country afford scope where young population may range unconstrained in body or in mind develop the power and faculty of man in high perfection these remove hundred and at own expense purchase the land occupy and support at new home from the moment of arrival can be cruel in this government when by event which can not control the indian be make discontent in ancient home to purchase land to give a new and extensive territory to pay the expense of removal and support a year in new abode how many thousand of own people would gladly embrace the opportunity of remove to the west on such condition if the offer make to the indians be extend to would be hail with gratitude and joy and be suppose that the wandering savage have a strong attachment to home than the settle civilized christian be more afflict to to leave the grave of father than be to brother and child rightly consider the policy of the general government toward the red man be not only liberal but generous be unwilling to submit to the law of the state and mingle with population to save from this alternative or perhaps utter annihilation the general government kindly offer a new home and propose to pay the whole expense of removal and settlement in the consummation of a policy originate at an early period and steadily pursue by every administration within the|present|century — so just to the state and so generous to the indians the executive feel have a right to expect the cooperation of congress and of all good and disintereste man the state moreover have a right to demand be substantially a part of the compact which make member of confederacy with georgia there be an express contract with the new state an implied of equal obligation why in authorize ohio indiana illinois missouri mississippi and alabama to form constitution and become separate state do congress include within limit extensive tract of indian land and in some instance powerful indian tribe be not understand by both party that the power of the state be to be coextensive with limit and that with all convenient dispatch the general government should extinguish the indian title and remove every obstruction to the complete jurisdiction of the state government over the soil probably not of those state would have accept a separate existence certainly would never have be grant by congress — have be understand that be to be confine for ever to those small portion of nominal territory the indian title to which have at the time be extinguish be therefore a duty which this government owe to the new state to extinguish as soon as possible the indian title to all land which congress have include within limit when this be do the duty of the general government in relation to the state and the indians within limit be at an end the indians may leave the state or not as choose the purchase of land do not alter in the least personal relation with the state government no act of the general government have ever be deem necessary to give the state jurisdiction over the person of the indians that possess by virtue of sovereign power within own limit in as full a manner before as after the purchase of the indian land nor can this government add to or diminish may not hope therefore that all good citizen and none more zealously than those who think the indians oppress by subjection to the law of the state will unite in attempt to open the eye of those child of the forest to true condition and by a speedy removal to relieve from all the evil real or imaginary present or prospective with which may be suppose to be threaten among the numerous cause of congratulation the condition of impost revenue deserve special mention in as much as promise the mean of extinguish the public debt sooner than be anticipate and furnish a strong illustration of the practical effect of the present tariff upon commercial interest the object of the tariff be object to by some as unconstitutional and be consider by almost all as defective in many of part the power to impose duty on import originally belong to the several state the right to adjust those duty with a view to the encouragement of domestic branch of industry be so completely incidental to that power that be difficult to suppose the existence of the one without the other the state have delegate whole authority over import to the general government without limitation or restriction save the very inconsiderable reservation relate to inspection law this authority have thus entirely pass from the state the right to exercise for the purpose of protection do not exist in and consequently if be not possess by the general government must be extinct political system would thus present the anomaly of a people strip of the right to foster own industry and to counteract the most selfish and destructive policy which may be adopt by foreign nation this sure can not be the case this indispensable power thus surrender by the state must be within the scope of the authority on the subject expressly delegate to congress in this conclusion be confirm as well by the opinion of presidents|washington jefferson madison and monroe who have each repeatedly recommend the exercise of this right under the constitution as by the uniform practice of congress the continue acquiescence of the state and the general understanding of the people the difficulty of a more expedient adjustment of the present tariff although great be far from be insurmountable some be unwilling to improve any of part because would destroy the whole other fear to touch the objectionable part lest those approve should be jeoparde be persuade that the advocate of these conflicting view do injustice to the american people and to representative the general interest be the interest of each and confidence be entire that to insure the adoption of such modification of the tariff as the general interest require be only necessary that that interest should be understand be an infirmity of nature to mingle interest and prejudice with the operation of reason power and attribute to the object of like and dislikes quality do not possess and effect can not produce the effect of the present tariff be doubtless over rat both in evil and in advantage by class of reasoner the reduced price of cotton and other agricultural product be ascribe wholly to influence and by another the reduced price of manufacture article the probability be that neither opinion approach the truth and that both be induce by that influence of interest and prejudice to which have refer the decrease of price extend throughout the commercial world embrace not only the raw material and the manufacture article but provision and land the cause must therefore be deep and more pervading than the tariff of the|united|state may in a measure be attributable to the increase value of the precious metal produce by a diminution of the supply and an increase in the demand while commerce have rapidly extend and population have augment the supply of gold and silver the general medium of exchange have be greatly interrupt by civil convulsion in the country from which be principally draw a part of the effect too be doubtless owe to an increase of operative and improvement in machinery but on the whole be questionable whether the reduction in the price of land produce and manufacture have be great than the appreciation of the standard of value while the chief object of duty should be revenue may be so adjust as to encourage manufacture in this adjustment however be the duty of the government to be guide by the general good object of national importance alone ought to be protect of these the production of soil mine and work shop essential to national defense occupy the first rank what ever other specie of domestic industry have the importance to which have refer may be expect after temporary protection to compete with foreign labor on equal term merit the same attention in a subordinate degree the present tariff taxis some of the comfort of life unnecessarily high undertake to protect interest too local and minute to justify a general exaction and also attempt to force some kind of manufacture for which the country be not ripe much relief will be derive in some of these respect from the measure of last session the good as well as fair mode of determine whether from any just consideration a particular interest ought to receive protection would be to submit the question singly for deliberation if after due examination of merit unconnected with extraneous consideration such as a desire to sustain a general system or to purchase support for a different interest should enlist in favor a majority of the representative of the people there can be little danger of wrong or injury in adjust the tariff with reference to protective effect if this obviously just principle be honestly adhere to the branch of industry which deserve protection would be save from the prejudice excite against when that protection form part of a system by which portion of the country feel or conceive to be oppress what be incalculably more important the vital principle of system that principle which require acquiescence in the will of the majority would be secure from the discredit and danger to which be expose by the act of majority found not on identity of conviction but on combination of small minority enter into for the purpose of mutual assistance in measure which rest solely on own merit could never be carry be well aware that this be a subject of so much delicacy on account of the extended interest in involve as to require that should be touch with the utmost caution and that while an abandonment of the policy in which originate a policy coeval with government and pursue through successive administration be neither to be expect or desire the people have a right to demand and have demand that be so modify as to correct abuse and obviate injustice that deliberation on this interesting subject should be uninfluence by those partisan conflict that be incident to free institution be the fervent wish of heart to make this great question which unhappily so much divide and excite the public mind subservient to the short sight view of faction must destroy all hope of settle satisfactorily to the great body of the people and for the general interest can not therefore in take leave of the subject too earnestly for own feeling or the common good warn against the blighting consequence of such a course accord to the estimate at the|treasury|department the receipt in the treasury during the|present|year will amount to which will exceed by the estimate present in the last annual report of the secretary of the treasury the total expenditure during the|year exclusive of public debt be estimate at and the payment on account of public debt for the same period will have be leave a balance in the treasury on of in connection with the condition of finance afford pleasure to remark that judicious and efficient arrangement have be make by the|treasury|department for secure the pecuniary responsibility of the public officer and the more punctual payment of the public due the|revenue|cutter|service have be organize and place on a good footing and aid by an increase of inspector at expose point and regulation adopt under the act of for the inspection and appraisement of merchandise have produce much improvement in the execution of the law and more security against the commission of fraud upon the revenue abuse in the allowance for fishing bounty have also be correct and a material saving in that branch of the service thereby effect in addition to these improvement the system of expenditure for sick sea man belong to the merchant service have be revise and be render uniform and economical the benefit of the fund applicable to this object have be usefully extend the prosperity of country be also further evince by the increase revenue arise from the sale of public land as will appear from the report of the commissioner of the|general|land|office and the document accompany which be herewith transmit beg leave to draw attention to this report and to the propriety of make early appropriation for the object which specify attention be again invite to the subject connect with that portion of the public interest intrust to some of be refer to in former message and be present in detail in the report of the secretary of war herewith submit refer also to the report of that officer for a knowledge of the state of the army fortification arsenal and indian affair all of which will be perceive have be guard with zealous attention and care be worthy of consideration whether the armament necessary for the fortification on maritime frontier which be now or shortly will be complete should not be in readiness sooner than the customary appropriation will enable the department to provide this precaution seem to be due to the general system of fortification which have be sanction by congress and be recommend by that maxim of wisdom which tell in peace to prepare for war refer to the report of the secretary of the navy for a highly satisfactory account of the manner in which the concern of that department have be conduct during the|present|year position in relation to the most powerful nation of the earth and the present condition of europe admonish to cherish this arm of national defense with peculiar care separate by wide sea from all those government whose power may have reason to dread have nothing to apprehend from attempt at conquest be chiefly attack upon commerce and harrasse in road upon coast against which have to guard a naval force adequate to the protection of commerce always afloat with an accumulation of the mean to give a rapid extension in case of need furnish the power by which all such aggression may be prevent or repel the attention of the government have therefore be recently direct more to preserve the public vessel already build and provide material to be place in depot for future use than to increase number with the aid of congress in a|few|year the government will be prepare in case of emergency to put afloat a powerful navy of new ship almost as soon as old one could be repair the modification in this part of the service suggest in last annual message which be notice more in detail in the report of the secretary of the navy be again recommend to serious attention the report of the|postmaster|general in like manner exhibit a satisfactory view of the important branch of the government under charge in addition to the benefit already secure by the operation of the|post|office|department considerable improvement within the|present|year have be make by an increase in the accommodation afford by stage coach and in the frequency and celerity of the mail between some of the most important point of the union under the late contract improvement have be provide for the southern section of the country and at the same time an annual saving make of upward of not with stand the excess of expenditure beyond the current receipt for a|few|years|past necessarily incur in the fulfillment of exist contract and in the additional expense between the period of contracting to meet the demand create by the rapid growth and extension of flourish country yet the satisfactory assurance be give that the future revenue of the department will be sufficient to meet extensive engagement the system recently introduce that subject receipt and disbursement to strict regulation have entirely fulfil design give full assurance of the punctual transmission as well as the security of the fund of the department the efficiency and industry of officer and the ability and energy of contractor justify an increase confidence in continued prosperity the attention of congress be call on a former occasion to the necessity of such a modification in the office of attorney general of the|united|state as would render more adequate to the want of the public service this result in the establishment of the office of solicitor of the treasury and the early measure be take to give effect to the provision of the law which authorize the appointment of that officer and define duty but be not believe that this provision however useful in be calculate to supersede the necessity of extend the duty and power of the attorney general 's office on the contrary be convince that the public interest would be greatly promote by give to that officer the general superintendence of the various law agent of the government and of all law proceeding whether civil or criminal in which the|united|state may be interested allow at the same time such compensation as would enable to devote undivided attention to the public business think such a provision be alike due to the public and to the officer occasion of reference from the different executive department to the attorney general be of frequent occurrence and the prompt decision of the question so referred tend much to facilitate the dispatch of business in those department the report of the secretary of the treasury hereto append show also a branch of the public service not specifically intrust to any officer which may be advantageously commit to the attorney general but independently of those consideration this office be now of daily duty be originally organize and compensation fix with a view to occasional service leave to the incumbent time for the exercise of profession in private practice the state of thing which warrant such an organization no longer exist the frequent claim upon the service of this officer would render absence from the seat of government in professional attendance upon the court injurious to the public service and the interest of the government could not fail to be promote by charge with the general superintendence of all legal concern under a strong conviction of the justness of these suggestion recommend to congress to make the necessary provision for give effect to and to place the attorney general in regard to compensation on the same footing with the head of the several executive department to this officer may also be intrust a cognizance of the case of insolvency in public debtor especially if the view which submit on this subject last|year should meet the approbation of congress — to which again solicit attention attention be respectfully invite to the situation of place by the constitution under the exclusive jurisdiction and control of congress this district be certainly entitle to a much great share of consideration than have yet receive there be a want of uniformity in law particularly in those of a penal character which increase the expense of administration and subject the people to all the inconvenience which result from the operation of different code in so small a territory on different side of the potomac the same offense be punishable in unequal degree and the peculiarity of many of the early law of maryland and virginia remain in force not with stand repugnance in some case to the improvement which have supersede in those state besides a remedy for these evil which be loudly call for be respectfully submit whether a provision authorize the election of a delegate to represent the want of the citizen of this district on the floor of congress be not due to and to the character of government no principle of freedom and there be none more important than that which cultivate a proper relation between the governor and the govern imperfect as this must be in this case yet be believe that would be greatly improve by a representation in congress with the same

and canal regret that any difference of opinion in the mode of contribute to should exist between and if in state this difference go beyond what the occasion may be deem to call for hope to find an apology in the great importance of the subject an unfeigned respect for the high source from which this branch of have emanate and an anxious wish to be correctly understand by constituent in the discharge of all duty diversity of sentiment among public functionary actuate by the same general motif on the character and tendency of particular measure be an incident common to all government and the more to be expect in which like owe existence to the freedom of opinion and must be uphold by the same influence control as thus be by a high tribunal before which respective act will be canvass with the indulgence due to the imperfection of nature and with that intelligence and unbiased judgment which be the true corrective of error all that responsibility demand be that the public good should be the measure of view dictate alike frank expression and honest maintenance in the message which be present to congress at the opening of present session endeavor to exhibit briefly view upon the important and highly interesting subject to which attention be now to be direct be desirous of present to the representative of the several states in congress assemble the inquiry whether some mode could not be devise which would reconcile the diversity of opinion concern the power of this government over the subject of internal improvement and the manner in which these power if confer by the constitution ought to be exercise the act which be call upon to consider have therefore be pass with a knowledge of view on this question as these be express in the message refer to in that document the follow suggestion will be find after the extinction of the public debt be not probable that any adjustment of the tariff upon principle satisfactory to the people of the union will until a remote period if ever leave the government without a considerable surplus in the treasury beyond what may be require for current service as then the period approach when the application of the revenue to the payment of debt will cease the disposition of the surplus will present a subject for the serious deliberation of congress and may be fortunate for the country that be yet to be decide consider in connection with the difficulty which have heretofore attend appropriation for purpose of internal improvement and with those which this experience tell will certainly arise whenever power over such subject may be exercise by the|general|government be hope that may lead to the adoption of some plan which will reconcile the diversify interest of the states and strengthen the bond which unite every member of the union in peace and in war will be benefit by the improvement of inland navigation and the construction of highway in the several states let then endeavor to attain this benefit in a mode which will be satisfactory to all that hitherto adopt have by many of fellow citizen be deprecate as an infraction of the constitution while by other have be view as inexpedient all feel that have be employ at the expense of harmony in the legislative council and advert to the constitutional power of congress to make what consider a proper disposition of the surplus revenue subjoin the follow remark to avoid these evil appear to that the most safe just and federal disposition which could be make of the surplus revenue would be apportionment among the several states accord to ratio of representation and should this measure not be find warrant by the constitution that would be expedient to propose to the states an amendment authorize the constitutional power of the|federal|government to construct or promote work of internal improvement present in point of view the first as bear upon the sovereignty of the states within whose limit execution be contemplate if jurisdiction of the territory which may occupy be claim as necessary to preservation and use the second as assert the simple right to appropriate money from the|national|treasury in aid of such work when undertake by state authority surrender the claim of jurisdiction in the first view the question of power be an open and can be decide without the embarrassment attend the other arise from the practice of the government although frequently and strenuously attempt the power to this extent have never be exercise by the government in a single instance do not in opinion possess and no bill therefore which admit can receive official sanction but in the other view of the power the question be differently situate the ground take at an early period of the government be that whenever money have be raise by the general authority and be to be apply to a particular measure a question arise whether the particular measure be within the enumerate authority vest in congress if be the money requisite for may be apply to if not no such application can be make the document in which this principle be first advanced be of deservedly high authority and should be hold in grateful remembrance for immediate agency in rescue the country from much exist abuse and for conservative effect upon some of the most valuable principle of the constitution the symmetry and purity of the government would doubtless have be better preserve if this restriction of the power of appropriation could have be maintain without weaken ability to fulfill the general object of institution an effect so likely to attend admission notwithstanding apparent fitness that every subsequent administration|of|the|government embrace a period of out of the|forty two|year of existence have adopt a more enlarged construction of the power be not purpose to detain by a|minute recital of the act which sustain this assertion but be proper that should notice some of the most prominent in order that the reflection which suggest to mind may be better understand in the administration of mr. jefferson have example of the exercise of the right of appropriation which in the consideration that lead to adoption and in effect upon the public mind have have a great agency in mark the character of the power than any subsequent event allude to the payment of for the purchase of louisiana and to the original appropriation for the construction of the cumberland road the latter act derive much weight from the acquiescence and approbation of of the most powerful of the original member of the confederacy express through respective legislature although the circumstance of the latter case may be such as to deprive so much of as relate to the actual construction of the road of the force of an obligatory exposition of the constitution must nevertheless be admit that so far as the mere appropriation of money be concern present the principle in most imposing aspect no less than different law have be pass through all the form of the constitution appropriate upward of out of the|national|treasury in support of that improvement with the approbation of every president of the|united|state include predecessor since commencement independently of the sanction give to appropriation for the cumberland and other road and object under this power the administration of mr. madison be characterize by an act which furnish the strong evidence of opinion of extent a bill be pass through both houses|of|congress and present for approval set apart and pledge certain fund for construct road and canal and improve the navigation of water course in order to facilitate promote and give security to internal commerce among the several states and to render more easy and less expensive the mean and provision for the common defense regard the bill as assert a power in the|federal|government to construct road and canal within the limit of the states in which be make object to passage on the ground of unconstitutionally declare that the assent of the respective states in the mode provide by the bill could not confer the power in question that the only case in which the consent and cession of particular states can extend the power of congress be those specify and provide for in the constitution and superadde to these avowal opinion that a restriction of the power to provide for the common defense and general welfare to case which be to be provide for by the expenditure of money would still leave within the legislative power of congress all the great and most important measure of government money be the ordinary and necessary mean of carry into execution have not be able to consider these declaration in any other point of view than as a concession that the right of appropriation be not limit by the power to carry into effect the measure for which the money be ask as be formerly contend the view of mr. monroe upon this subject be not leave to inference during administration a bill be pass through both houses of congress confer the jurisdiction and prescribe the mode by which the|federal|government should exercise in the case of the cumberland road return with objection to passage and in assign take occasion to say that in the early stage of the government have incline to the construction that have no right to expend money except in the performance of act authorize by the other specific grant of power accord to a strict construction of but that on further reflection and observation mind have undergo a change that opinion then be that congress have an unlimited power to raise money and that in appropriation have a discretionary power restrict only by the duty to appropriate to purpose of common defense and of general not local national not state benefit and this be avow to be the govern principle through the residue of administration the view of the last administration be of such recent date as to render a particular reference to unnecessary be well know that the appropriate power to the utmost extent which have be claim for in relation to internal improvement be fully recognize and exercise by this brief reference to know fact will be sufficient to show the difficulty if not impracticability of bring back the operation of the government to the construction of the constitution set up in assume that to be true reading in relation to the power under consideration thus give an admonitory proof of the force of implication and the necessity of guard the constitution with sleepless vigilance against the authority of precedent which have not the sanction of most plainly define power for although be the duty of all to look to that sacred instrument instead of the statute book to repudiate at all time encroachment upon spirit which be too apt to be effect by the conjuncture of peculiar and facilitating circumstance be not less true that the public good and the nature of political institution require that individual difference should yield to a well settle acquiescence of the people and confederate authority in particular construction of the constitution on doubtful point not to concede this much to the spirit of institution would impair stability and defeat the object of the constitution the bill before do not call for a more definite opinion upon the particular circumstance which will warrant appropriation of money by congress to aid work of internal improvement for although the extension of the power to apply money beyond that of carry into effect the object for which be appropriate have as have see be long claim and exercise by the|federal|government yet such grant have always be professedly under the control of the general principle that the work which may be thus aid should be of a general not local national not state character a disregard of this distinction would of necessity lead to the subversion of the federal system that even this be an unsafe arbitrary in nature and liable consequently to great abuse be too obvious to require the confirmation of experience be however sufficiently definite and imperative to mind to forbid approbation of any bill have the character of the under consideration have give to provision all the reflection demand by a just regard for the interest of those of fellow citizen who have desire passage and by the respect which be due to a coordinate branch of the government but be not able to view in any other light than as a measure of purely local character or if can be consider national that no further distinction between the appropriate duty of the general and state governments need be attempt for there can be no local interest that may not with equal propriety be denominate national have no connection with any established system of improvement be exclusively within the limit of a state start at a point on the|ohio|river and run out to an interior town and even as far as the state be interested confer partial instead of general advantage consider the magnitude and importance of the power and the embarrassment to which from the very nature of the thing exercise must necessarily be subject the real friend of internal improvement ought not to be willing to confide to accident and chance what be properly national in character or otherwise be an inquiry which be often extremely difficult of solution the appropriation of one|year for an object which be consider national may be render nugatory by the refusal of a succeed congress to continue the work on the ground that be local no aid can be derive from the intervention of corporation the question regard the character of the work not that of those by whom be to be accomplish notwithstanding the union of the government with the corporation by whose immediate agency any work of internal improvement be carry on the inquiry will still remain be national and conducive to the benefit of the whole or local and operate only to the advantage of a portion of the union but although may not feel to be official duty to interpose the executive veto to the passage of a bill appropriate money for the construction of such work as be authorize by the states and be national in character do not wish to be understand as express an opinion that be expedient at this time for the|general|government to embark in a system of this kind and anxious that constituent should be possess of view on this as well as on all other subject which have commit to discretion shall state frankly and briefly besides many minor consideration there be prominent view of the subject which have make a deep impression upon mind which think be well entitled to serious attention and will hope be maturely weigh by the people from the official communication submit to appear that if no adverse and unforeseen contingency happen in foreign relation and no unusual diversion be make of the fund set apart for the payment of the national debt may look with confidence to entire extinguishment in the short period of four|years the extent to which this pleasing anticipation be dependent upon the policy which may be pursue in relation to measure of the character of the one now under consideration must be obvious to all and equally so that the event of the present session be well calculated to awaken public solicitude upon the subject by the statement from the|treasury|department and those from the clerk of the senate and house|of|representatif herewith submit appear that the bill which have pass into law and those which in all probability will pass before the adjournment of congress anticipate appropriation which with the ordinary expenditure for the support of government will exceed considerably the amount in the treasury for the|year|1830 thus whilst be diminish the revenue by a reduction of the duty on tea coffee and cocoa the appropriation for internal improvement be increase beyond the available mean of the treasury and if to this calculation be add the amount contain in bill which be pende before the houses may be safely affirm that would not make up the excess over the treasury receipt unless the payment of the national debt be postpone and the mean now pledge to that object apply to those enumerate in these bill without a well regulated system of internal improvement this exhausting mode of appropriation be not likely to be avoid and the plain consequence must be either a continuance of the national debt or a resort to additional taxis although many of the states with a laudable zeal and under the influence of an enlighten policy be successfully apply separate effort to work of this character the desire to enlist the aid of the|general|government in the construction of such as from nature ought to devolve upon and to which the mean of the individual states be inadequate be both rational and patriotic and if that desire be not gratify now do not follow that never will be the general intelligence and public spirit of the american people furnish a sure guaranty that at the proper time this policy will be make to prevail under circumstance more auspicious to successful prosecution than those which now exist but great as this object undoubtedly be be not the only which demand the foster care of the government the preservation and success of the republican principle rest with to elevate character and extend influence rank among most important duty and the good mean to accomplish this desirable end be those which will rivet the attachment of citizen to the government of choice by the comparative lightness of public burthen and by the attraction which the superior success of operation will present to the admiration and respect of the world through the favor of an overruling and indulgent providence country be bless with general prosperity and citizen exempt from the pressure of taxation which other less favor portion of the human family be oblige to bear yet be true that many of the taxis collect from citizen through the medium of impost have for a considerable period be onerous in many particular these taxis have bear severely upon the laboring and less prosperous class of the community be impose on the necessary of life and this too in case where the burthen be not relieve by the consciousness that would ultimately contribute to make independent of foreign nation for article of prime necessity by the encouragement of growth and manufacture at home have be cheerfully bear because be think to be necessary to the support of government and the payment of the debt unavoidably incur in the acquisition and maintenance of national right and liberty but have a right to calculate on the same cheerful acquiescence when be know that the necessity for continuance would cease be not for irregular improvident and unequal appropriation of the public fund will not the people demand as have a right to do such a prudent system of expenditure as will pay the debt of the union and authorize the reduction of every tax to as low a point as the wise observance of the necessity to protect that portion of manufacture and labor whose prosperity be essential to national safety and independence will allow when the national debt be pay the duty upon those article which do not raise may be repeal with safety and still leave trust without oppression to any section of the country an accumulating surplus fund which may be beneficially apply to some well digest system of improvement under this view the question as to the manner in which the|federal|government can or ought to embark in the construction of road and canal and the extent to which may impose burthen on the people for these purpose may be present on own merit free of all disguise and of every embarrassment except such as may arise from the constitution assume these suggestion to be correct will not constituent require the observance of a course by which can be effect ought not to require with the good disposition to aid as far as can conscientiously in furtherance of work of internal improvement opinion be that the sound view of national policy at this time point to such a course besides the avoidance of an evil influence upon the local concern of the country how solid be the advantage which the government will reap from in the elevation of character how gratify the effect of present to the world the sublime spectacle of a republic of happy people in the fourth|year of existence after have pass through protract war the for the acquisition and the other for the maintenance of liberty free from debt and with all immense resource unfettered what a salutary influence would not such an exhibition exercise upon the cause of liberal principle and free government throughout the world would not find in effect an additional guaranty that political institution will be transmit to the most remote posterity without decay a course of policy destine to witness event like these can not be benefit by a legislation which tolerate a scramble for appropriation that have no relation to any general system of improvement and whose good effect must of necessity be very limited in the good view of these appropriation the abuse to which lead far exceed the good which be capable of promote may be resort to as artful expedient to shift upon the government the loss of unsuccessful private speculation and thus by minister to personal ambition and self aggrandizement tend to sap the foundation of public virtue and taint the administration of the government with a demoralizing influence in the other view of the subject and the only remain which be intention to present at this time be involve the expediency of embark in a system of internal improvement without a previous amendment of the constitution explain and define the precise power of the|federal|government over assume the right to appropriate money to aid in the construction of national work to be warrant by the contemporaneous and continued exposition of the constitution insufficiency for the successful prosecution of must be admit by all candid mind if look to usage to define the extent of the right that will be find so variant and embrace so much that have be overrule as to involve the whole subject in great uncertainty and to render the execution of respective duty in relation to replete with difficulty and embarrassment be in regard to such work and the acquisition of additional territory that the practice obtain first footing in most if not all other dispute question of appropriation the construction of the constitution may be regard as unsettled if the right to apply money in the enumerate case be place on the ground of usage this subject have be of much and may add painful reflection to have bearing that be well calculated to exert a powerful influence upon hitherto prosperous system of government and which on some account may even excite despondency in the breast of an american citizen will not detain with profession of zeal in the cause of internal improvement if to be friend be a virtue which deserve commendation country be bless with an abundance of for do not suppose there be an intelligent citizen who do not wish to see flourish but though all be friend but few trust be unmindful of the mean by which should be promote none certainly be so degenerate as to desire success at the cost of that sacred instrument with the preservation of which be indissolubly bind country 's hope if different impression be entertain in any|quarter if be expect that the people of this country reckless of constitutional obligation will prefer local interest to the principle of the union such expectation will in the end be disappoint or if be not so then indeed have the world but little to hope from the example of free government when an honest observance of constitutional compact can not be obtain from community like our nee not be anticipate elsewhere and the cause in which there have be so much martyrdom and from which so much be expect by the friend of liberty may be abandon and the degrade truth that man be unfit for self government admit and this will be the case if expediency be make a rule of construction in interpret the constitution power in no government could desire a well shield for the insidious advance which be ever ready to make upon the check that be design to restrain action but do not entertain such gloomy apprehension if be the wish of the people that the construction of road and canal should be conduct by the|federal|government be not only highly expedient but indispensably necessary that a previous amendment of the constitution delegate the necessary power and defining and restrict exercise with reference to the sovereignty of the states should be make without nothing extensively useful can be effect the right to exercise as much jurisdiction as be necessary to preserve the work and to raise fund by the collection of toll to keep in repair can not be dispense with the cumberland road should be an instructive admonition of the consequence of act without this right year|after|year contest be witness grow out of effort to obtain the necessary appropriation for complete and repair this useful work whilst congress may claim and exercise the power a succeed one may deny and this fluctuation of opinion must be unavoidably fatal to any scheme which from extent would promote the interest and elevate the character of the country the experience of the past have show that the opinion of congress be subject to such fluctuation if be the desire of the people that the agency of the|federal|government should be confine to the appropriation of money in aid of such undertaking in virtue of state authority then the occasion the manner and the extent of the appropriation should be make the subject of constitutional regulation this be the more necessary in order that may be equitable among the several states promote harmony between different section of the union and representative preserve other part of the constitution from be undermine by the exercise of doubtful power or the too great extension of those which be not so and protect the whole subject against the deleterious influence of combination to carry by concert measure which consider by may meet but little countenance that a constitutional adjustment of this power upon equitable principle be in the high degree desirable can scarcely be doubt nor can fail to be promote by every sincere friend to the success of political institution in no government be appeal to the source of power in case of real doubt more suitable than in our no good motive can be assign for the exercise of power by the constitute authority while those for whose benefit be to be exercise have not confer and may not be willing to confer would seem to that an honest application of the concede power of the|general|government to the advancement of the common weal present a sufficient scope to satisfy a reasonable ambition the difficulty and suppose impracticability of obtain an amendment of the constitution in this respect be firmly believe in a great degree unfounded the time have never yet be when the patriotism and intelligence of the american people be not fully equal to the great exigency and never will when the subject call forth interposition be plainly present to to do so with the question involve in this bill and to urge to an early zealous and full consideration of deep importance be in estimation among the high of duty a suppose connection between appropriation for internal improvement and the system of protect duty grow out of the anxiety of those more immediately interested in success have give rise to suggestion which be proper should notice on this occasion opinion on these subject have never be conceal from those who have a right to know those which have entertain on the latter have frequently place in opposition to individual as well as community whose claim upon friendship and gratitude be of the strong character but trust there have be nothing in public life which have expose to the suspicion of be think capable of sacrifice view of duty to private consideration however strong may have be or deep the regret which be capable of exciting as long as the encouragement of domestic manufacture be direct to national end shall receive from a temperate but steady support there be no necessary connection between and the system of appropriation on the contrary appear to that the supposition of dependence upon each other be calculate to excite the prejudice of the public against both the former be sustain on the ground of consistency with the letter and spirit of the constitution of origin being trace to the assent of all the party to the original compact and of have the support and approbation of a majority of the people on which account be at least entitle to a fair experiment the suggestion to which have allude refer to a force continuance of the national debt by mean of large appropriation as a substitute for the security which the system derive from the principle on which have hitherto be sustain such a course would certainly indicate either an unreasonable distrust of the people or a consciousness that the system do not possess sufficient soundness for support if leave to voluntary choice and own merit those who suppose that any policy thus round can be long uphold in this country have look upon history with eye very different from this policy like every other must abide the will of the people who will not be likely to allow any device however specious to conceal character and tendency in present these opinion have speak with the freedom and candor which think the occasion for expression call for and now respectfully return the bill which have be under consideration for further deliberation and judgment transcript to the senate of the|united|state gentleman the accompanying proposition in the form of a treaty have be recently send to by special messenger from the|choctaw|nation|of|indian and since be receive a protest against have be forward both evince a desire to cede to the|united|state all country east of the mississippi and both be here submit these measure be the voluntary act of the indians the government be not represent in the council which adopt nor have any previous intimation that such step be in contemplation the indians convene of own accord settle and execute the proposition contain in the treaty present to and agree to be bind by if within three|months should receive the approbation of the president and senate the other measure be equally own be certainly desirous on various and very pressing account as will appear from the accompany document that some agreement should be conclude with the indians by which an object so important as removal beyond the territorial limit of the states may be effect in settle the term of such an agreement be dispose to exercise the utmost liberality and to concur in any which be consistent with the constitution and not incompatible with the interest of the|united|state and duty to the indians can not however regard the term propose by the choctaws to be in all respect of this character but desirous of conclude an arrangement upon such as be have draw up the accompany amendment which propose to offer to the choctaws if meet the approbation of the senate the condition which offer be such as in judgment will be most likely to be acceptable to both party and be liable to the few objection not be tenacious though on the subject will most cheerfully adopt any modification which on a frank interchange of opinion constitutional adviser may suggest and which shall be satisfied be reconcilable with official duty with these view ask the opinion of the senate upon the follow question will the senate advise the conclusion of a treaty with the choctaw|nation accord to the term which propose or will the senate advise the conclusion of a treaty with that tribe as modify by the alteration suggest by if not what further alteration or modification will the senate propose be fully aware that in thus resort to the early practice of the government by ask the previous advice of the senate in the discharge of this portion of duty be depart from a long and for many|years an unbroken usage in similar case but be satisfied that this resort be consistent with the provision of the constitution that be strongly recommend in this instance by consideration of expediency and that the reason which have lead to the observance of a different practice though very cogent in negotiation with foreign nation do not apply with equal force to those make with indian tribe flatter that will not meet the disapprobation of the senate among the reason for a previous expression of the view of the senate the following be state as most prominent the indians have request that proposition should be submit to the senate the opinion of the senate in relation to the term to be propose will have a salutary effect in a future negotiation if one should be deem proper the choctaw be of the most numerous and powerful tribe within border and as the conclusion of a treaty with may have a control effect upon other tribe be important that term should be well consider those now propose by the choctaws though objectionable be believe be susceptible of modification which will leave conformable to the humane and liberal policy which the government desire to observe toward the indian tribe and be at the same time acceptable to to be possess of the view of the senate on this important and delicate branch of future negotiation would enable the president to act much more effectively in the exercise of particular function there be also the good reason to believe that measure in this respect emanate from the united counsel of the treaty make power would be more satisfactory to the american people and to the indians will be see that the pecuniary stipulation be large and in bring this subject to the consideration of the senate may be allow to remark that the amount of money which may be secure to be pay should in judgment be view as of minor importance if a fund adequate to the object in view can be obtain from the land which cede all the purpose of the government should be regard as answer the great desideratum be the removal of the indians and the settlement of the perplexing question involve in present location a question in which several of of this union have the deep interest and which if leave undecided much longer may eventuate in serious injury to the indians transcript fellow citizen of the senate and house|of|representatif afford pleasure to tender friendly greeting to on the occasion of assembling at the seat of government to enter upon the important duty to which have be call by the voice of countryman the task devolve on under a provision of the constitution to present to as the federal legislature of sovereign state and happy people a view of affair and to propose such

disposition and to aid in conduct to useful practical conclusion the claim of citizen for depredation upon property long since commit under the authority and in many instance by the express direction of the then exist government of france remain unsatisfied and must therefore continue to furnish a subject of unpleasant discussion and possible collision between the government cherish however a lively hope found as well on the validity of those claim and the establish policy of all enlighten government as on the known integrity of the french monarch that the injurious delay of the past will find redress in the equity of the future minister have be instruct to press these demand on the french government with all the earnestness which be call for by importance and irrefutable justice and in a spirit that will evince the respect which be due to the feeling of those from whom the satisfaction be require minister recently appoint to spain have be authorize to assist in remove evil alike injurious to both country either by conclude a commercial convention upon liberal and reciprocal term or by urge the acceptance in full extent of the mutually beneficial provision of navigation act have also be instruct to make a further appeal to the justice of spain in behalf of citizen for indemnity for spoliation upon commerce commit under authority an appeal which the pacific and liberal

place by territorial limit extensive population and great power high in the rank of nation the|united|state have always find a steadfast friend although recent invasion of turkey awaken a lively sympathy for those who be expose to the desolation of war can not but anticipate that the result will prove favorable to the cause of civilization and to the progress of human happiness the treaty of peace between these power have be ratify can not be insensible to the great benefit to be derive by the commerce of the|united|state from unlock the navigation of the|black|sea a free passage into which be secure to all merchant vessel bind to port of russia under a flag at peace with the porte this advantage enjoy upon condition by most of the power of europe have hitherto be withhold from during the|past|summer an antecedent but unsuccessful attempt to obtain be renew under circumstance which promise the most favorable result although these result have fortunately be thus in part attain further facility to the enjoyment of this new field for the enterprise of citizen be in opinion sufficiently desirable to insure to most zealous attention trade with austria although of secondary importance have be gradually increase and be now so extended as to deserve the foster care of the government a negotiation commence and nearly complete with that power by the late administration have be consummate by a treaty of amity navigation and commerce which will be lay before the senate during the recess of congress diplomatic relation with portugal have be resume the peculiar state of thing in that country cause a suspension of the recognition of the representative who present until an opportunity be have to obtain from official organ there information regard the actual and as far as practicable prospective condition of the authority by which the representative in question be appoint this information be receive the application of the establish rule of government in like case be no longer withhold considerable advance have be make during the|present|year in the adjustment of claim of citizen upon denmark for spoliation but all that have a right to demand from that government in behalf have not yet be concede from the liberal footing however upon which this subject have with the approbation of the claimant be place by the government together with the uniformly just and friendly disposition which have be evince by danish majesty there be a reasonable ground to hope that this single subject of difference will speedily be remove relation with the|barbary|power continue as have long be of the most favorable character the policy of keep an adequate force in the mediterranean as security for the continuance of this tranquillity will be persevere in as well as a similar one for the protection of commerce and fishery in the pacific the southern republics of own hemisphere have not yet realize all the advantage for which have be so long struggle trust however that the|day be not distant when the restoration of peace and internal quiet under permanent system of government secure the liberty and promote the happiness of the citizen will crown with complete success long and arduous effort in the cause of self government and enable to salute as friendly rival in all that be truly great and glorious the recent invasion of mexico and the effect thereby produce upon domestic policy must have a controlling influence upon the great question of south|american emancipation have see the fell spirit of civil dissension rebuke and perhaps for ever stifle in that republic by the love of independence if be true as appearance strongly indicate the spirit of independence be the master spirit and if a corresponding sentiment prevail in the other states this devotion to liberty can not be without a proper effect upon the counsel of the mother country the adoption by spain of a pacific policy toward former colony an event consoling to humanity and a blessing to the world in which can not fail largely to participate — may be most reasonably expect the claim of citizen upon the south|american government generally be in a train of settlement while the principal part of those upon brazil have be adjust and a decree in council ordering bond to be issue by the minister of the treasury for amount have receive the sanction of imperial majesty this event together with the exchange of the ratification of the treaty negotiate and conclude in happily terminate all serious cause of difference with that power measure have be take to place commercial relation with peru upon a well footing than that upon which have hitherto rest and if meet by a proper disposition on the part of that government important benefit may be secure to both country deeply interested as be in the prosperity of sister republic and more particularly in that of immediate neighbor would be most gratify to be permit to say that the treatment which have receive at hand have be as universally friendly as the early and constant solicitude manifest by the|united|state for success give a right to expect but become duty to inform that prejudice long indulge by a portion of the inhabitant of mexico against the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the|united|state have have an unfortunate influence upon the affair of the country and have diminish that usefulness to own which be justly to be expect from talent and zeal to this cause in a great degree be to be impute the failure of several measure equally interesting to both party but particularly that of the mexican government to ratify a treaty negotiate and conclude in own capital and under own eye under these circumstance appear expedient to give to mr. poinsett the option either to return or not as in judgment the interest of country may require and instruction to that end be prepare but before could be dispatch a communication be receive from the government of mexico through charge d'affaire here request the recall of minister this be promptly comply with and a representative of a rank correspond with that of the mexican diplomatic agent near this government be appoint conduct toward that republic have be uniformly of the most friendly character and have thus remove the only alleged obstacle to harmonious intercourse can not but hope that an advantageous change will occur in affair in justice to mr. poinsett be proper to say that immediate compliance with the application for recall and the appointment of a successor be not to be ascribe to any evidence that the imputation of an improper interference by in the local politic of mexico be well found nor to a want of confidence in talent or integrity and to add that the truth of the charge have never be affirm by the federal government of mexico in communication with consider of the most urgent of duty to bring to attention the propriety of amend that part of the constitution which relate to the election of president and vice president system of government be by framer deem an experiment and therefore consistently provide a mode of remedy defect to the people belong the right of elect chief magistrate be never design that choice should in any case be defeat either by the intervention of electoral college or by the agency confide under certain contingency to the|house|of|representatives experience prove that in proportion as agent to execute the will of the people be multiply there be danger of wish be frustrate some may be unfaithful all be liable to err so far therefore as the people can with convenience speak be safe for to express own will the number of aspirant to the presidency and the diversity of the interest which may influence claim leave little reason to expect a choice in the first instance and in that event the election must devolve on the|house|of|representatives where be obvious the will of the people may not be always ascertain or if ascertain may not be regard from the mode of voting by state the choice be to be make by vote and may often occur that of these will be control by an individual representative honor and office be at the disposal of the successful candidate repeat balloting may make apparent that a single individual hold the cast in hand may not be tempt to name reward but even without corruption suppose the probity of the representative to be proof against the powerful motif by which may be assail the will of the people be still constantly liable to be misrepresent may err from ignorance of the wish of constituent another from a conviction that be duty to be govern by own judgment of the fitness of the candidate finally although all be inflexibly honest all accurately inform of the wish of constituent yet under the present mode of election a minority may often elect a president and when this happen may reasonably be expect that effort will be make on the part of the majority to rectify this injurious operation of institution but although no evil of this character should result from such a perversion of the first principle of system that the majority be to govern must be very certain that a president elect by a minority can not enjoy the confidence necessary to the successful discharge of duty in this as in all other matter of public concern policy require that as few impediment as possible should exist to the free operation of the public will let then endeavor so to amend system that the office of chief|magistrate may not be confer upon any citizen but in pursuance of a fair expression of the will of the majority would therefore recommend such an amendment of the constitution as may remove all intermediate agency in the election of the president and vice president the mode may be so regulated as to preserve to each state present relative weight in the election and a failure in the first attempt may be provide for by confine the second to a choice between the high candidate in connection with such an amendment would seem advisable to limit the service of the chief magistrate to a single term of either four|or|six|year if however should not be adopt be worthy of consideration whether a provision disqualify for office the representatives in congress on whom such an election may have devolve would not be proper while member of congress can be constitutionally appoint to office of trust and profit will be the practice even under the most conscientious adherence to duty to select for such station as be believe to be better qualified to fill than other citizen but the purity of government would doubtless be promote by exclusion from all appointment in the gift of the president in whose election may have be officially concern the nature of the judicial office and the necessity of secure in the cabinet and in diplomatic station of the high rank the good talent and political experience should perhaps except these from the exclusion there be perhaps few man who can for any great length of time enjoy office and power without be more or less under the influence of feeling unfavorable to the faithful discharge of public duty integrity may be proof against improper consideration immediately address to but be apt to acquire a habit of look with indifference upon the public interest and of tolerate conduct from which an unpracticed man would revolt office be consider as a species of property and government rather as a means of promote individual interest than as an instrument create solely for the service of the people corruption in some and in other a perversion of correct feeling and principle divert government from legitimate end and make an engine for the support of the few at the expense of the many the duty of all public officer be or at least admit of be make so plain and simple that man of intelligence may readily qualify for performance and can not but believe that more be lose by the long continuance of man in office than be generally to be gain by experience submit therefore to consideration whether the efficiency of the government would not be promote and official industry and integrity better secure by a general extension of the law which limit appointment to four|year in a country where office be create solely for the benefit of the people no man have any more intrinsic right to official station than another office be not establish to give support to particular man at the public expense no individual wrong be therefore do by removal since neither appointment to nor continuance in office be a matter of right the incumbent become an officer with a view to public benefit and when these require removal be not to be sacrifice to private interest be the people and alone who have a right to complain when a bad officer be substitute for a good one who be remove have the same mean of obtain a living that be enjoy by the million who never hold office the propose limitation would destroy the idea of property now so generally connect with official station and although individual distress may be some time produce would by promote that rotation which constitute a lead principle in the republican creed give healthful action to the system no very considerable change have occur during the recess of congress in the condition of either agriculture commerce or manufacture the operation of the tariff have not prove so injurious to the former or as beneficial to the latter as be anticipate importation of foreign good have not be sensibly diminish while domestic competition under an illusive excitement have increase the production much beyond the demand for home consumption the consequence have be low price temporary embarrassment and partial loss that such of manufacturing establishment as be base upon capital and be prudently manage will survive the shock and be ultimately profitable there be no good reason to doubt to regulate conduct so as to promote equally the prosperity of these cardinal interest be of the most difficult task of government and may be regret that the complicated restriction which now embarrass the intercourse of nation could not by common consent be abolish and commerce allow to flow in those channel to which individual enterprise always sure guide may direct but must ever expect selfish legislation in other nation and be therefore compel to adapt own to regulation in the manner best calculate to avoid serious injury and to harmonize the conflict interest of agriculture commerce and manufacture under these impression invite attention to the exist tariff believe that some of provision require modification the general rule to be apply in graduate the duty upon article of foreign growth or manufacture be that which will place own in fair competition with those of other country and the inducement to advance even a step beyond this point be control in regard to those article which be of primary necessity in time of war when reflect upon the difficulty and delicacy of this operation be important that should never be attempt but with the utmost caution frequent legislation in regard to any branch of industry affect value and by which capital may be transfer to new channel must always be productive of hazardous speculation and loss in deliberating therefore on these interesting subject local feeling and prejudice should be merge in the patriotic determination to promote the great interest of the whole all attempt to connect with the party conflict of the|day be necessarily injurious and should be discountenance action upon should be under the control of high and purer motif legislation subject to such influence can never be just and will not long retain the sanction of a people whose active patriotism be not bound by sectional limit nor insensible to that spirit of concession and forbearance which give life to political compact and still sustain discard all calculation of political ascendancy the north the south the east and the west should unite in diminish any burthen of which either may justly complain the agricultural interest of country be so essentially connect with every other and so superior in importance to all that be scarcely necessary to invite to particular attention be principally as manufacture and commerce tend to increase the value of agricultural production and to extend application to the want and comfort of society that deserve the foster care of government look forward to the period not far distant when a sink fund will no longer be require the duty on those article of importation which can not come in competition with own production be the first that should engage the attention of congress in the modification of the tariff of these tea and coffee be the most important enter largely into the consumption of the country and have become article of necessity to all class a reduction therefore of the exist duty will be feel as a common benefit but like all other legislation connect with commerce to be efficacious and not injurious should be gradual and certain the public prosperity be evince in the increased revenue arise from the sale of the public land and in the steady maintenance of that produce by impost and tonnage not withstand the additional duty impose by the act of and the unusual importation in the early part of that|year the balance in the treasury on be the receipt of the|current|year be estimate at and the expenditure for the same time at leave a balance in the treasury on of there will have be pay on account of the public debt during the|present|year the sum of reduce the whole debt of the government on to include of the stock subscribe to the|bank|of|the|united|states the payment on account of public debt make on be be apprehend that the sudden withdrawal of so large a sum from the bank in which be deposit at a time of unusual pressure in the money market may cause much injury to the interest dependent on bank accommodation but this evil be wholly avert by an early anticipation of at the treasury aid by the judicious arrangement of the officer of the|bank|of|the|united|state this state of the finance exhibit the resource of the nation in an aspect highly flatter to industry and auspicious of the ability of government in a very short time to extinguish the public debt when this shall be do population will be relieve from a considerable portion of present burthen and will find not only new motif to patriotic affection but additional mean for the display of individual enterprise the fiscal power of the state will also be increase and may be more extensively exert in favor of education and other public object while ample mean will remain in the federal government to promote the general weal in all the mode permit to authority after the extinction of the public debt be not probable that any adjustment of the tariff upon principle satisfactory to the people of the union will until a remote period if ever leave the government without a considerable surplus in the treasury beyond what may be require for current service as then the period approach when the application of the revenue to the payment of debt will cease the disposition of the surplus will present a subject for the serious deliberation of congress and may be fortunate for the country that be yet to be decide consider in connection with the difficulty which have heretofore attend appropriation for purpose of internal improvement and with those which this experience tell will certainly arise when ever power over such subject may be exercise by the central government be hope that may lead to the adoption of some plan which will reconcile the diversify interest of the state and strengthen the bond which unite every member of the union in peace and in war will be benefit by the improvement of inland navigation and the construction of high way in the several state let then endeavor to attain this benefit in a mode which will be satisfactory to all that hitherto adopt have by many of fellow citizen be deprecate as an infraction of the constitution while by other have be view as inexpedient all feel that have be employ at the expense of harmony in the legislative council to avoid these evil appear to that the most safe just and federal disposition which could be make of the surplus revenue would be apportionment among the several state accord to ratio of representation and should this measure not be find warrant by the constitution that would be expedient to propose to the state an amendment authorizing regard an appeal to the source of power in case of real doubt and where exercise be deem indispensable to the general welfare as among the most sacred of all obligation upon this country more than any other have in the providence of god be cast the special guardianship of the great principle of adherence to write constitution if fail here all hope in regard to will be extinguish that this be intend to be a government of limited and specific and not general power must be admit by all and be duty to preserve for the character intend by framer if experience point out the necessity for an enlargement of these power let apply for to those for whose benefit be to be exercise and not undermine the whole system by a resort to over strain construction the scheme have work well have exceed the hope of those who devise and become an object of admiration to the world be responsible to country and to the glorious cause of self government for the preservation of so great a good the great mass of legislation relate to internal affair be intend to be leave where the federal convention find in the state government nothing be clear in view than that be chiefly indebte for the success of the constitution under which be now act to the watchful and auxiliary operation of the state authority this be not the reflection of a|day but belong to the most deeply rooted conviction of mind can not therefore too strongly or too earnestly for own sense of importance warn against all encroachment upon the legitimate sphere of state sovereignty sustain by healthful and invigorate influence the federal system can never fall in the collection of the revenue the long credit authorize on good import from beyond the|cape|of|good|hope be the chief cause of the loss at present sustain if these be shorten to and and warehouse provide by government sufficient to receive the good offer in deposit for security and for debenture and if the right of the|united|state to a priority of payment out of the estate of insolvent debtor be more effectually secure this evil would in a great measure be obviate an authority to construct such house be therefore with the propose alteration of the credit recommend to attention be worthy of notice that the law for the collection and security of the revenue arise from impost be chiefly frame when the rate of duty on import good present much less temptation for illicit trade than at present exist there be reason to believe that these law be in some respect quite insufficient for the proper security of the revenue and the protection of the interest of those who be dispose to observe the injurious and demoralizing tendency of a successful system of smuggling be so obvious as not to require comment and can not be too carefully guard against therefore suggest to congress the propriety of adopt efficient measure to prevent this evil avoid however as much as possible every unnecessary infringement of individual liberty and embarrassment of fair and lawful business on an examination of the record of the treasury have be forcibly strike with the large amount of public money which appear to be outstanding of the sum thus due from individual to the government a considerable portion be undoubtedly desperate and in many instance have probably be render so by remissness in the agent charge with collection by proper exertion a great part however may yet be recover and what ever may be the portion respectively belong to these class behoove the government to ascertain the real state of the fact this can be do only by the prompt adoption of judicious measure for the collection of such as may be make available be believe that a very large amount have be lose through the inadequacy of the mean provide for the collection of debt due to the public and that this inadequacy lie chiefly in the want of legal skill habitually and constantly employ in the direction of the agent engage in the service must think be admit that the supervisory power over suit bring by the public which be now vest in an accounting officer of the treasury not select with a view to legal knowledge and encumber as be with numerous other duty operate unfavorably to the public interest be important that this branch of the public service should be subject to the supervision of such professional skill as will give efficiency the expense attendant upon such a modification of the executive department would be justify by the sound principle of economy would recommend therefore that the duty now assign to the agent of the treasury so far as relate to the superintendence and management of legal proceeding on the part of the|united|state be transfer to the attorney general and that this officer be place on the same footing in all respect as the head of the other department receive like compensation and have such subordinate officer provide for department as may be requisite for the discharge of these additional duty the professional skill of the attorney general employ in direct the conduct of marshal and district attorney would hasten the collection of debt now in suit and hereafter save much to the government may be further extend to the superintendence of all criminal proceeding for offense against the|united|state in make this transfer great care should be take however that the power necessary to be not impaired of great security consist in control over all account until be audit or report for suit in connection with the forego view would suggest also an inquiry whether the provision of the act of congress authorize the discharge of the person of the debtor to the government from imprisonment may not consistently with the public interest be extend to the release of the debt where the conduct of the debtor be wholly exempt from the imputation of fraud some more liberal policy than that which now prevail in reference to this unfortunate class of citizen be certainly due to and would prove beneficial to the country the continuance of the liability after the mean to discharge have be exhaust can only serve to dispirit the debtor or where resource be but partial the want of power in the government to compromise and release the demand instigate to fraud as the only resource for secure a support to family thus sink into a state of apathy and become a useless drone in society or a vicious member of if not a feeling witness of the rigor and inhumanity of country all experience prove that oppressive debt be the bane of enterprise and should be the care of a republic not to exert a grind power over misfortune and poverty since the last session of congress numerous fraud on the treasury have be discover which think duty to bring under the cognizance of the united|states court for this district by a criminal prosecution be opinion and that of able counsel who be consult that the case come within the penalty of the act of the 17th congress approve provide for punishment of fraud commit on the government of the|united|state either from some defect in the law or in administration every effort to bring the accuse to trial under provision prove ineffectual and the government be drive to the necessity of resort to the vague and inadequate provision of the common law be therefore duty to call attention to the law which have be pass for the protection of the treasury if indeed there be no provision by which those who may be unworthily intrust with guardianship can be punish for the most flagrant violation of duty extend even to the most fraudulent appropriation of the public fund to own use be time to remedy so dangerous an omission or if the law have be pervert from original purpose and criminal deserve to be punish under provision have be rescue by legal subtlety ought to be make so plain by amendatory provision as to baffle the art of perversion and accomplish the end of original enactment in of the most flagrant cause the court decide that the prosecution be bar by the statute which limit prosecution for fraud to two|year in this case all the evidence of the fraud and indeed all knowledge that a fraud have be commit be in possession of the party accuse until after the|two|year have elapse surely the statute ought not to run in favor of any man while retain all the evidence of crime in own possession and least of all in favor of a public officer who continue to defraud the treasury and conceal the transaction for the brief term of two|year would therefore recommend such an alteration of the law as will give the injured party and the government two|year after the disclosure of the fraud or after the accuse be out of office to commence prosecution in connection with this subject invite the attention of congress to a general and minute inquiry into the condition of the government with a view to ascertain what office can be dispense with what expense retrench and what improvement may be make in the organization of various part to secure the proper responsibility of public agent and promote efficiency and justice in all operation the report of the secretary of war will make acquaint with the condition of army fortification arsenal and indian affair the proper discipline of the army the training and equipment of the militia the education bestow at west|point and the accumulation of the mean of defense applicable to the naval force will tend to prolong the peace now enjoy and which every good citizen more especially those who have feel the misery of even a successful warfare must ardently desire to perpetuate the return from the subordinate branch of this service exhibit a regularity and order highly creditable to character both officer and soldier seem imbue with a proper sense of duty and conform to the restraint of exact discipline with that cheerfulness which become the profession of arm there be need however of further legislation to obviate the inconvenience specify in the report under consideration to some of which be proper that should call particular attention the act of congress of to reduce and fix the military establishment remain unexecuted as regard the command of of the regiment of artillery can not now be deem a guide to the executive in make the proper appointment an explanatory act designate the class of officer out of which the grade be to be fill whether from the military list as exist prior to the act of or from as have be fix by that act would remove this difficulty be also important that the law regulate the pay and emolument of officer generally should be more specific than now be those for example in relation to the paymaster and surgeon general assign to an annual salary of but be silent as to allowance which in certain exigency of the service may be deem indispensable to the discharge of duty this circumstance have be the authority for extend to various allowance at different time under former administration but no uniform rule have be observe on the subject similar inconvenience exist in other case in which the construction put upon the law by the public accountant may operate unequally produce confusion and expose officer to the odium of claim what be not due recommend to fostering care as of safe mean of national defense the military academy this institution have already exercise the happy influence upon the moral and intellectual character of army and such of the graduate as from various cause may not pursue the profession of arm will be scarcely less useful as citizen knowledge of the military art will be advantageously employ in the militia service and in a measure secure to that class of troop the advantage which in this respect belong to stand army would also suggest a review of the pension law for the purpose of extend benefit to every revolutionary soldier who aid in establish liberty and who be unable to maintain in comfort these relic of the|war|of|independence have strong claim upon country 's gratitude and bounty the law be defective in not embrace within provision all those who be during the last war disable from support by manual labor such an amendment would add but little to the amount of pension and be call for by the sympathy of the people as well as by consideration of sound policy will be perceive that a large addition to the list of pensioner have be occasion by an order of the late administration depart materially from the rule which have previously prevail consider an act of legislation suspend operation as soon as be inform that have commence before this period however application under the new regulation have be prefer to the number of of which on march|27 the date of revocation be admit for the amount there be neither estimate nor appropriation and besides this deficiency the regular allowance accord to the rule which have heretofore govern the department exceed the estimate of late secretary by about|$50,000 for which an appropriation be ask particular attention be request to that part of the report of the secretary of war which relate to the money hold in trust for the seneca tribe of indians will be perceive that without legislative aid the executive can not obviate the embarrassment occasion by the diminution of the dividend on that fund which originally amount to and have recently be invest in united|states stock the condition and ulterior destiny of the indian tribe within the limit of some of state have become object of much interest and importance have long be the policy of government to introduce among the art of civilization in the hope of gradually reclaim from a wander life this policy have however be couple with another wholly incompatible with success profess a desire to civilize and settle have at the same time lose no opportunity to purchase land and thrust farther into the wilderness by this mean have not only be keep in a wandering state but be lead to look upon as unjust and indifferent to fate thus though lavish in expenditure upon the subject government have constantly defeat own policy and the indians in general recede farther and farther to the west have retain savage habit a portion however of the southern tribe have mingle much with the white and make some progress in the art of civilized life have lately attempt to erect an independent government within the limit of georgia and alabama these state claim to be the only sovereign within territory extend law over the indians which induce the latter to call upon the|united|state for protection under these circumstance the question present be whether the general government have a right to sustain those people in pretension the constitution declare that no new state shall be form or erect within the jurisdiction of any other state without the consent of legislature if the general government be not permit to tolerate the erection of a confederate state within the territory of of the member of this union against consent much less could allow a foreign and independent government to establish there georgia become a member of the confederacy which eventuate in federal union as a sovereign state always assert claim to certain limit which have be originally define in colonial charter and subsequently recognize in the treaty of peace have ever since continue to enjoy except as have be circumscribe by own voluntary transfer of a portion of territory to the|united|state in the article of cession of alabama be admit into the union on the same footing with the original state with boundary which be prescribe by congress there be no constitutional conventional or legal provision which allow less power over the indians within border than be possess by maine or new|york would the people of maine permit the penobscot tribe to erect an independent government within state and unless do would not be the duty of the general government to support in resist such a measure would the people of new|york permit each remnant of the nation within border to declare an independent people under the protection of the|united|state could the indians establish a separate republic on each of reservation in ohio and if be so disposed would be the duty of this government to protect in the attempt if the principle involve in the obvious answer to these question be abandon will follow that the object of this government be reverse and that have become a part of duty to aid in destroy the state which be establish to protect actuate by this view of the subject inform the indians inhabit part of georgia and alabama that attempt to establish an independent government would not be countenance by the executive of the|united|state and advise to emigrate beyond the mississippi or submit to the law of those state conduct toward these people be deeply interesting to national character present condition contrast with what once be make a most powerful appeal to sympathy ancestor find the uncontrolled possessor of these vast region by persuasion and force have be make to retire from river to river and from mountain to mountain until some of the tribe have become extinct and other have

state whose limit could control that step can not be retrace a state can not be dismember by congress or restrict in the exercise of constitutional power but the people of those state and of every state actuate by feeling of justice and a regard for national honor submit to the interesting question whether something can not be do consistently with the right of the state to preserve this much injure race as a means of effect this end suggest for consideration the propriety of set apart an ample district west of the mississippi and without the limit of any state or territory now form to be guarantee to the indian tribe as long as shall occupy each tribe have a distinct control over the portion designate for use there may be secure in the enjoyment of government of own choice subject to no other control from the|united|state than such as may be necessary to preserve peace on the frontier and between the several tribe there the benevolent may endeavor to teach the art of civilization

acquaint with the condition and useful employment of that branch of service during the|present|year constitute as do the good stand security of this country against foreign aggression claim the especial attention of government in this spirit the measure which since the termination of the last war have be in operation for gradual enlargement be adopt and should continue to be cherish as the off spring of national experience will be see however that not withstand the great solicitude which have be manifest for the perfect organization of this arm and the liberality of the appropriation which that solicitude have suggest this object have in many important respect not be secure in time of peace have need of no more ship of war than be requisite to the protection of commerce those not want for this object must lay in the harbor where without proper covering rapidly decay and even under the good precaution for preservation must soon become useless such be already the case with many of fine vessel which though unfinished will now require immense sum of money to be restore to the condition in which be when commit to proper element on this subject there can be but little doubt that good policy would be to discontinue the building of ship of the first and second class and look rather to the possession of ample material prepare for the emergency of war than to the number of vessel which can float in a season of peace as the index of naval power judicious deposit in navy yard of timber and other material fashion under the hand of skillful workman and fit for prompt application to various purpose would enable at all time to construct vessel as fast as can be man and save the heavy expense of repair except to such vessel as must be employ in guard commerce the proper point for the establishment of these yard be indicate with so much force in the report of the|navy|board that in recommend to attention deem unnecessary to do more than express hearty concurrence in view the yard in this district be already furnish with most of the machinery necessary for ship building will be competent to the supply of the select by the board as the good for the concentration of material and from the facility and certainty of communication between will be useless to incur at those depot the expense of similar machinery especially that use in prepare the usual metallic and wooden furniture of vessel another improvement would be effect by dispense altogether with as now constitute and substitute in stead bureaux similar to those already exist in each member of the board transfer to the head of a separate bureau charge with specific duty would feel in high degree that wholesome responsibility which can not be divide without a far more than proportionate diminution of force valuable service would become still more so when separately appropriate to distinct portion of the great interest of the navy to the prosperity of which each would be impel to devote by the strong motif under such an arrangement every branch of this important service would assume a more simple and precise character efficiency would be increase and scrupulous economy in the expenditure of public money promote would also recommend that the|marine|corps be merge in the artillery or infantry as the good mode of cure the many defect in organization but little exceeding in number any of the regiment of infantry that corps have besides lieutenant colonel commandant brevet lieutenant colonel who receive the full pay and emolument of brevet rank without render proportionate service detail for marine service could as well be make from the artillery or infantry there be no peculiar training requisite for with these improvement and such other as zealous watchfulness and mature consideration may suggest there can be little doubt that under an energetic administration of affair the navy may soon be make every thing that the nation wish to be efficiency in the suppression of piracy in the west india sea and wherever squadron have be employ in secure the interest of the country will appear from the report of the secretary to which refer for other interesting detail among these would bespeak the attention of congress for the view present in relation to the inequality between the army and navy as to the pay of officer no such inequality should prevail between these

of thing ought to be remedie if can be do consistently with the public welfare be not to be doubt neither be to be disguise that the organization of judicial system be at once a difficult and delicate task to extend the circuit court equally throughout the different part of the union and at the same time to avoid such a multiplication of member as would encumber the supreme appellate tribunal be the object desire perhaps may be accomplish by divide the circuit judge into class and provide that the|supreme|court should be hold by these class alternately the chief justice always preside if an extension of the circuit court system to those state which do not now enjoy benefit should be determine upon would of course be necessary to revise the present arrangement of the circuit and even if

principle have since be much further extend by treaty with france sweden denmark the hanseatic city prussia in europe and with the republics of colombia and of central|america in this hemisphere the mutual abolition of discriminate duty and charge upon the navigation and commercial intercourse between the party be the general maxim which characterize all there be reason to expect that will at no distant period be adopt by other nation both of europe and america and to hope that by universal prevalence of the fruitful source of war of commercial competition will be extinguish among the nation upon whose government many of fellow citizen have have long pende claim of indemnity for depredation upon property during a period when the right of neutral commerce be disregard be that of denmark be soon after the event occur the subject of a special mission from the|united|state at the close of which the assurance be give by danish|majesty that at a period of more tranquillity and of less

promise be now in progress that a small portion of the claim have already be settle to the satisfaction of the claimant and that have reason to hope that the remainder will shortly be place in a train of equitable adjustment this result have always be confidently expect from the character of personal integrity and of benevolence which the sovereign of the danish dominion have through every vicissitude of fortune maintain the general aspect of the affair of neighboring american nation of the south have be rather of approach than of settle tranquillity internal disturbance have be more frequent among than common friend would have desire intercourse with all have continue to be that of friendship and of mutual good will treaty of commerce and of boundary with the united|mexican|state have be negotiate but from various successive obstacle not yet bring to a final conclusion the civil war which unfortunately still prevail in the republic of central|america have be unpropitious to the cultivation of commercial relation with and the dissension and revolutionary change in the republic of colombia and of peru have be see with cordial regret by who would gladly contribute to the happiness of both be with great satisfaction however that have witness the recent conclusion of a peace between the government of and of brazil and be equally gratify to observe that indemnity have be obtain for some of the injury which fellow citizen have sustain in the latter of those country the rest be in a train of negotiation which hope may terminate to mutual satisfaction and that may be succeed by a treaty of commerce and navigation upon liberal principle propitious to a great and grow commerce already important to the interest of country the condition and prospect of the revenue be more favorable than most sanguine expectation have anticipate the balance in the treasury on exclusive of the money receive under the convention of with great|britain be the receipt into the treasury from so far as have be ascertain to form the basis of an estimate amount to which with the receipt of the|present|quarter estimate at form an aggregate of receipt during the|year of the expenditure of the|year may probably amount to and leave in the treasury on the sum of the receipt of the|present|year have amount to near more than be anticipate at the commencement of the last session of congress the amount of duty secure on importation from the|first|of|january|to|the|30th|of|september be about|$22,997,000 and that of the estimate accrue revenue be form an aggregate for the|year of near this be more than the estimate last|december for the accrue revenue of the|present|year which with allowance for draw back and contingent deficiency be expect to produce an actual revenue of have these only be realize the expenditure of the|year would have be also proportionally reduce for of these receive upward of have be apply to the extinction of public debt bear an interest of a year and of course reduce the burden of interest annually payable in future by the amount of more|than|$500,000 the payment on account of interest during the|current|year exceed present an aggregate of more|than|$12,000,000 apply during the|year to the discharge of the public debt the whole of which remain due on will amount only to that the revenue of the|ensuing|year will not fall short of that receive in the one now expire there be indication which can scarcely prove deceptive in country an uniform experience of have show that what ever the tariff of duty upon article import from abroad have be the amount of importation have always bear an average value nearly approach to that of the export though occasionally differ in the balance some time be more and some time less be indeed a general law of prosperous commerce that the real value of export should by a small and only a small balance exceed that of import that balance be a permanent addition to the wealth of the nation the extent of the prosperous commerce of the nation must be regulate by the amount of export and an important addition to the value of these will draw after a corresponding increase of importation have happen in the vicissitude of the season that the harvest of all europe have in the|late|summer and autumn fall short of usual average a relaxation of the interdict upon the importation of grain and flour from abroad have ensue a propitious market have be open to the granary of country and a new prospect of reward present to the labor of the husband man which for several|year have be deny this accession to the profit of agriculture in the middle and western portion of union be accidental and temporary may continue only for a|single|year may be as have be often experience in the revolution of time but the first of several harvest in succession may consider certain that for the|approaching|year have add an item of large amount to the value of export and that will produce a corresponding increase of importation may therefore confidently be foresee that the revenue of will equal and probably exceed that of and will afford the mean of extinguish more of the principal of the public debt this new element of prosperity to that part of agricultural industry which be occupy in produce the first article of human subsistence be of the most cheering character to the feeling of patriotism proceed from a cause which humanity will view with concern the suffering of scarcity in distant land yield a consolatory reflection that this scarcity be in no respect attributable to that come from the dispensation of who ordain all in wisdom and goodness and who permit evil only as an instrument of good that far from contribute to this scarcity agency will be apply only to the alleviation of severity and that in pour forth from the abundance of own garner the supply which will partially restore plenty to those who be in need shall reduce store and add to the price of own bread so as in some degree to participate in the want which will be the good fortune of country to relieve the great interest of an agricultural commercial and manufacturing nation be so link in union together that no permanent cause of prosperity to of can operate without extend influence to the other all these interest be alike under the protect power of the legislative authority and the duty of the representative body be to conciliate in harmony together so far as the object of taxation be to raise a revenue for discharge the debt and defray the expense of the community operation should be adapt as much as possible to suit the burden with equal hand upon all in proportion with ability of bear without oppression but the legislation of nation be some time intentionally make to bear heavily upon the interest of another that legislation adapt as be mean to be to the special interest of own people will often press most unequally upon the several component interest of neighbor thus the legislation of great|britain when as have recently be avow adapt to the depression of a rival nation will naturally abound with regulation to interdict upon the production of the soil or industry of the other which come in competition with own and will present encouragement perhaps even bounty to the raw material of the other state which can not produce and which be essential for the use of manufacture competitor in the market of the world with those of commercial rival such be the state of commercial legislation of great|britain as bear upon interest exclude with interdict duty all importation except in time of approach famine of the great staple of production of middle and western state proscribe with equal rigor the bulky lumber and live stock of the same portion and also of the northern and eastern part of union refuse even the rice of the south unless aggravate with a charge of duty upon the northern carrier who bring to but the cotton indispensable for loom will receive almost duty free to weave into a fabric for own wear to the destruction of own manufacture which be enable thus to under sell be the self protect energy of this nation so helpless that there exist in the political institution of country no power to counteract the bias of this foreign legislation that the grower of grain must submit to this exclusion from the foreign market of produce that the shipper must dismantle ship the trade of the north stagnate at the wharf and the manufacturer starve at loom while the whole people shall pay tribute to foreign industry to be clothe in a foreign garb that the|congress|of|the|union be impotent to restore the balance in favor of native industry destroy by the statute of another realm more just and generous sentiment will trust prevail if the tariff adopt at the last session of congress shall be find by experience to bear oppressively upon the interest of any section of the union ought to be and can not doubt will be so modify as to alleviate burden to the voice of just complaint from any portion of constituent the representative of the state and of the people will never turn away ear but so long as the duty of the foreign shall operate only as a bounty upon the domestic article while the planter and the merchant and the shepherd and the husbandman shall be find thrive in occupation under the duty impose for the protection of domestic manufacture will not repine at the prosperity share with by fellow citizen of other profession nor denounce as violation of the constitution the deliberate act of congress to shield from the wrong of foreign the native industry of the union while the tariff of the last session of congress be a subject of legislative deliberation be foretell by some of opposer that of necessary consequence would be to impair the revenue be yet too soon to pronounce with confidence that this prediction be erroneous the obstruction of avenue of trade not unfrequently open an issue to another the consequence of the tariff will be to increase the exportation and to diminish the importation of some specific article but by the general law of trade the increase of exportation of article will be follow by an increase importation of other the duty upon which will supply the deficiency which the diminished importation would otherwise occasion the effect of taxation upon revenue can seldom be

the amicable discussion which have succeed the adoption of this measure which as affect harshly the interest of the|united|state become subject of expostulation on part the principle upon which justification have be place have be of a diversified character have be at once ascribe to a mere recurrence to the old long establish principle of colonial monopoly and at the same time to a feeling of resentment because the offer of an act of parliament open the colonial port upon certain condition have not be grasp at with sufficient eagerness by an instantaneous conformity to at a subsequent period have be intimate that the new exclusion be in resentment because a prior act of parliament of open certain colonial port under heavy and burdensome restriction to vessel of the|united|state have not be reciprocate by an admission of british vessel from the colony and cargo without any restriction or discrimination what ever but be the motive for the interdiction what may have manifest no disposition either by negotiation or by correspond legislative enactment to recede from and have be give distinctly to understand that neither of the bill which be under the consideration of congress at last session would have be deem sufficient in concession to have be reward by any relaxation from the british interdict be of the inconvenience inseparably connect with the attempt to adjust by reciprocal legislation interest of this nature that neither party can know what would be satisfactory to the other and that after enact a statute for the avowed and sincere purpose of conciliation will generally be find utterly inadequate to the expectation of the other party and will terminate in mutual disappointment the session of congress have terminate without any act upon the subject a proclamation be issue on conformably to the provision of the 6th section of the act of declare the fact that the trade and intercourse authorize by the british act of parliament of between

that period have already expire the state of mutual interdiction have again take place the|british|government have not only decline negotiation upon this subject but by the principle have assume with reference to have preclude even the mean of negotiation become not the self respect of the|united|state either to solicit gratuitous favor or to accept as the grant of a favor that for which an ample equivalent be exact remain to be determine by the respective government whether the trade shall be open by act of reciprocal legislation be in the mean time satisfactory to know that apart from the inconvenience result from a disturbance of the usual channel of trade no loss have be sustain by the commerce the navigation or the revenue of the|united|state and none of magnitude be to be apprehend from this exist state of mutual interdict with the other maritime and commercial nation of europe intercourse continue with little variation since the cessation by the convention of of all discriminate duty upon the vessel of the|united|state and of france in either country trade with that nation have increase and be increase a disposition on the part of france have be manifest to renew that negotiation and in accede to the proposal have express the wish that may be extend to other subject upon which a good understanding between the party would be beneficial to the interest of both the origin of the political relation between the|united|state and france be coeval with the|first|year of independence the memory of be interwoven with that of arduous struggle for national existence weaken as have occasionally be since that time can by never be forget and should hail with exultation the moment which should indicate a recollection equally friendly in spirit on the part of france a fresh effort have recently be make by the minister of the|united|state reside at paris to obtain a consideration of the just claim of citizen of the|united|state to the reparation of wrong long since commit many of frankly acknowledge and all of entitle upon every principle of justice to a candid examination the proposal last make to the|french|government have be to refer the subject which have form an obstacle to this consideration to the determination of a sovereign the common friend of both to this offer no definitive answer have yet be receive but the gallant and honorable spirit which have at all time be the pride and glory of france will not ultimately permit the demand of innocent sufferer to be extinguish in the mere consciousness of the power to reject a new treaty of amity navigation and commerce have be conclude with the|kingdom|of|sweden which will be submit to the senate for advice with regard to ratification at a more recent date a minister plenipotentiary from the|hanseatic|republic of hamburg lubeck and bremen have be receive charge with a special mission for the negotiation of a treaty of amity and commerce between that ancient and renowned league and the|united|state this negotiation have accordingly be commence and be now in progress the result of which will if successful be also submit to the senate for consideration since the accession of the emperor nicholas to the imperial throne of all the russias the friendly disposition toward the|united|state so constantly manifest by predecessor have continue unabated and have be recently testify by the appointment of a minister plenipotentiary to reside at this place from the interest take by this sovereign in behalf of the suffering greeks and from the spirit with which other of the great european power be cooperate with the friend of freedom and of humanity may indulge the hope that will obtain relief from that most unequal of conflict which have so long and so gallantly sustained that will enjoy the blessing of self government which by suffering in the cause of liberty have richly earn and that independence will be secure by those liberal institution of which country furnish the early example in the history of man kind and which have consecrate to immortal remembrance the very soil for which be now again profusely pour forth blood the sympathy which the people and government|of the|united|state have so warmly indulge with cause have be acknowledge by government in a letter of thank which have receive from illustrious president a translation of which be now communicate to congress the representative of that nation to whom this tribute of gratitude be intend to be pay and to whom be justly due in the american hemisphere the cause of freedom and independence have continue to prevail and if signalize by none of those splendid triumph which have crown with glory some of the|preceding|years have only be from the banishment of all external force against which the struggle have be maintain the shout of victory have be supersede by the expulsion of the enemy over whom could have be achieve friendly wish and cordial good will which have constantly follow the southern nation of america in all the vicissitude of war of independence be succeed by a solicitude equally ardent and cordial that by the wisdom and purity of institution may secure to the choice blessing of social order and the good reward of virtuous liberty disclaim alike all right and all intention of interfere in those concern which be the prerogative of independence to regulate as to shall seem fit hail with joy every indication of prosperity of harmony of persevering and inflexible homage to those principle of freedom and of equal right which be alone suited to the genius and temper of the american nation have be therefore with some concern that have observe indication of intestine division in some of the republics of the south and appearance of less union with another than believe to be the interest of all among the result of this state of thing have be that the treaty conclude at panama do not appear to have be ratify by the contracting party and that the meeting of the congress at tacubaya have be indefinitely postpone in accept the invitation to be represent at this congress while a manifestation be intend on the part of the|united|state of the most friendly disposition toward the southern republics by whom have be propose be hope that would furnish an opportunity for bring all the nation of this hemisphere to the common acknowledgment and adoption of the principle in the regulation of internal relation which would have secure a lasting peace and harmony between and have promote the cause of mutual benevolence throughout the globe but as obstacle appear to have arise to the reassembling of the congress of the minister commission on the part of the|united|state have return to the bosom of country while the minister charge with the ordinary mission to mexico remain authorize to attend the conference of the congress when ever may be resume a hope be for a short time entertain that a treaty of peace actually sign between the|government|of|buenos|ayres and of brazil would supersede all further occasion for those collision between belligerent pretension and neutral right which be so commonly the result of maritime war and which have unfortunately disturb the harmony of the relation between the|united|state and the|brazilian|government at last session congress be inform that some of the naval officer of that empire have advance and practice upon principle in relation to blockades and to neutral navigation which could not sanction and which commander find necessary to resist appear that have not be sustain by the|government|of|brazil some of the vessel capture under the assumed authority of these erroneous principle have be restore and trust that just expectation will be realize that adequate indemnity will be make to all the citizen of the|united|state who have suffer by the unwarranted capture which the brazilian tribunal have pronounce unlawful in the diplomatic discussion at rio|de|janeiro of these wrong sustain by citizen of the|united|state and of other which seem as if emanate immediately from that government the charge d'affaire of the|united|state under an impression that representation in behalf of the right and interest of country man be totally disregard and useless deem duty without wait for instruction to terminate official function to demand pass- port and return

the|brazilian|government however complain of as a measure for which no adequate intentional cause have be give by and upon an explicit assurance through charge d'affaire reside here that a successor to the late representative of the|united|state near that government the appointment of whom desire should be receive and treat with the respect due to character and that indemnity should be promptly

the ordinary diplomatic intercourse between the government and the friendly relation between respective nation turn from the momentous concern of union in intercourse with foreign nation to those of the deep interest in the administration of internal affair find the revenue of the|present|year correspond as nearly as may be expect with the anticipation of the last and present an aspect still more favorable in the promise of the next the balance in the treasury on be the receipt from as near as the return of yet receive can show amount to the receipt of the|present|quarter estimate at add to the above form an aggregate of of receipt the expenditure of the|year may perhaps amount to present a small excess over the receipt but of these upward of have be apply to the discharge of the

advancement of the general good of the subject recommend to congress at last session some be then definitively act upon other leave unfinished but partly matured will recur to attention without need a renewal of notice from the purpose of this communication will be to present to view the general aspect of public affair at this moment and the measure which have be take to carry into effect the intention of the legislature as signify by the law then and heretofore enact in intercourse with the other nation of the earth have still the happiness of enjoy peace and a general good understanding qualified however in several important instance by collision of interest and by unsatisfied claim of justice to the settlement of which the constitutional interposition of the legislative authority may become ultimately indispensable by the decease of the emperor alexander of russia which occur contemporaneously with the commencement of the last session of congress the|united|state have be deprive of a long try steady and faithful friend bear to the inheritance of absolute power and train in the school of adversity from which no power on earth however absolute be exempt that monarch from youth have be teach to feel the force and value of public opinion and to be sensible that the interest of own government would best be promote by a frank and friendly intercourse with this republic as those of people would be advance by a liberal intercourse with country a candid and confidential interchange of sentiment between and the government of the u.s. upon the affair of take place at a period not long precede demise and contribute to fix that course of policy which leave to the other government of europe no alternative but that of sooner or later recognize the independence of southern neighbor of which the example have by the|united|state already be set the ordinary diplomatic communication between successor the emperor nicholas and the|united|state have suffer some interruption by the illness departure and subsequent decease of minister reside here who enjoy as merit the entire confidence of new sovereign as have eminently respond to that of predecessor but have have the most satisfactory assurance that the sentiment of the reign emperor toward the|united|state be altogether conformable to those which have so long and constantly animate imperial brother and have reason to hope that will serve to cement that harmony and good understanding between the nation which found in congenial interest can not but result in the advancement of the welfare and prosperity of both relation of commerce and navigation with france be by the operation of the convention of with that nation in a state of gradual and progressive improvement convince by all experience no less than by the principle of fair and liberal reciprocity which the|united|state have constantly tender to all the nation of the earth as the rule of commercial intercourse which would universally prefer that fair and equal competition be most conducive to the interest of both party the|united|state in the negotiation of that convention earnestly contend for a mutual renunciation of discriminate duty and charge in the port of the country unable to obtain the immediate recognition of this principle in full extent after reduce the duty of discrimination so far as be find attainable be agree that at the expiration of two|year from when the convention be to go into effect unless a notice of six|month on either side should be give to the other that the convention must terminate those duty should be reduce fourth and that this reducation should be yearly repeat until all discrimination should cease while the convention should continue in force by the effect of this stipulation fourth of the discriminate duty which have be levy by each party upon the vessel of the other in port have already be remove and on the|first|of|next|october should the convention be still in force the remain fourth will be discontinue french vessel laden with french produce will be receive in port on the same term as own and our in return will enjoy the same advantage in the port of france by these approximation to an equality of duty and of charge not only have the commerce between the country prosper but friendly disposition have be on both side encourage and promote will continue to be cherish and cultivate on the part of the|united|state would have be gratify to have have in power to add that the claim upon the justice of the french government involve the property and the comfortable subsistence of many of fellow citizen and which have be so long and so earnestly urge be in a more promising train of adjustment than at last meeting but condition remain unaltered with the government of the netherlands the mutual abandonment of discriminate duty have be regulate by legislative act on both side the act of congress of abolish all discriminate duty of impost and tonnage upon the vessel and produce of the netherlands in the port of the|united|state upon the assurance give by the government of the netherlands that all such duty operate against the shipping and commerce of the|united|state in that kingdom have be abolish these reciprocal regulation have continue in force several|year when the discriminate principle be resume by the netherlands in a new and indirect form by a bounty of in the shape of a return of duty to national vessel and in which those of the|united|state be not permit to participate by the act of congress of all discriminate duty in the|united|state be again suspend so far as relate to the vessel and produce of the netherlands so long as the reciprocal exemption should be extend to the vessel and produce of the|united|state in the netherlands but the same act provide that in the event of a restoration of discriminate duty to operate against the shipping and commerce of the|united|state in any of the foreign country refer to therein the suspension of discriminate duty in favor of the navigation of such foreign country should cease and all the provision of the act impose discriminate foreign tonnage and impost duty in the|united|state should revive and be in full force with regard to that nation in the correspondence with the government of the netherlands upon this subject have contend that the favor show to own shipping by this bounty upon tonnage be not to be consider a discriminate duty but can not be deny that produce all the same effect have the mutual abolition be stipulate by treaty such a bounty upon the national vessel could scarcely have be grant consistent with good faith yet as the act of congress of have not expressly authorize the executive authority to determine what shall be consider as a revival of discriminate duty by a foreign government to the disadvantage of the|united|state and as the retaliatory measure on part however just and necessary may tend rather to that conflict of legislation which deprecate than to that concert to which invite all commercial nation as most conducive to interest and own have think more consistent with the spirit of institution to refer to the subject again to the paramount authority of the legislature to decide what measure the emergency may require than abruptly by proclamation to carry into effect the minatory provision of the|act|of|1824 during the last session of congress treaty of amity navigation and commerce be negotiate and sign at this place with the government of denmark in europe and with the federation of central|america in this hemisphere these treaty then receive the constitutional sanction of the senate by the advice and consent to ratification be accordingly ratified on the part of the u.s. and during the recess of congress have be also ratify by the other respective contracting party the ratification have be exchange and have be publish by proclamation copy of which be herewith communicate to congress these treaty have establish between the contracting party the principle of equality and reciprocity in broad and most liberal extent each party admit the vessel of the other into port laden with cargo the produce or manufacture of any|quarter of the globe upon the payment of the same duty of tonnage and impost that be chargeable upon own have further stipulate that the party shall hereafter grant no favor of navigation or commerce to any other nation which shall not upon the same term be grant to each other and that neither party will impose upon article of merchandise the produce or manufacture of the other any other or high duty than upon the like article be the produce or manufacture of any other country to these principle there be in the convention with denmark an exception with regard to the colony of that kingdom in the arctic sea but none with regard to colony in the|west|indy in the course of the|last|summer the term to which last commercial treaty with sweden be limit have expire a continuation of be in the contemplation of the swedish government and be believe to be desirable on the part of the|united|state have be propose by the|king|of|sweden that pende the negotiation of renewal the expire treaty should be mutually consider as still in force a measure which will require the sanction of congress to be carry into effect on part and which therefore recommend to consideration with prussia spain portugal and in general all the european power between whom and the united|states relation of friendly intercourse have exist condition have not materially varied since the last session of congress regret not to be able to say the same of commercial intercourse with the colonial possession of great|britain in america negotiation of the high importance to common interest have be for several|year in discussion between the government and on the part of the|united|state have be invariably pursue in the spirit of candor and conciliation interest of great magnitude and delicacy have be adjust by the convention of while that of mediate by the late emperor alexander have promise a satisfactory compromise of claim which the government of the u.s. in justice to the right of a numerous class of citizen be bind to sustain but with regard to the commercial intercourse between the|united|state and the british colony in america have be hitherto find impracticable to bring the party to an understanding satisfactory to both the relative geographical position and the respective product of nature cultivate by human industry have constitute the element of a commercial intercourse between the|united|state and british|america insular and continental important to the inhabitant of both country but have be interdict by great|britain upon a principle heretofore practice upon by the colonize nation of europe of hold the trade of colony each in exclusive monopoly to after the termination of the late war this interdiction have be revive and the british government decline include this portion of intercourse with possession in the negotiation of the convention of the trade be then carry on exclusively in british vessel til the act of congress concern navigation of and the supplemental act of meet the interdict by a corresponding measure on the part of the|united|state these measure not of retaliation but of necessary self defense be soon succeed by an act of parliament open certain colonial port to the vessel of the|united|state come directly from and to the importation from of certain article of produce burden with heavy duty and exclude some of the most valuable article of export the|united|state open port to british vessel from the colony upon term as exactly correspond with those of the act of parliament as in the relative position of the party could be make and a negotiation be commence by mutual consent with the hope on part that a reciprocal spirit of accommodation and a common sentiment of the importance of the trade to the interest of the inhabitant of the country between whom must be carry on would ultimately bring the party to a compromise with which both may be satisfied with this view the government of the|united|state have determine to sacrifice something of that entire reciprocity which in all commercial arrangement with foreign power be entitle to demand and to acquiesce in some inequality disadvantageous to rather than to forego the benefit of a final and permanent adjustment of this interest to the satisfaction of great|britain the negotiation repeatedly suspend by accidental circumstance be however by mutual agreement and express assent consider as pende and to be speedily resume in the mean time another act of parliament so doubtful and ambiguous in import as to have be misunderstood by the officer in the colony who be to carry into execution open again certain colonial port upon new condition and term with a threat to close against any nation which may not accept those term as prescribe by the british government this act pass not communicate to the government of the u.s. not understand by the british officer of the custom in the colony where be to be enforce be never the less submit to the consideration of congress at last session with the knowledge that a negotiation upon the subject have long be in progress and pledge give of resumption at an|early|day be deem expedient to await the result of that negotiation rather than to subscribe implicitly to term the import of which be not clear and which the british authority in this hemisphere be not prepared to explain immediately after the close of the last session of congress of most distinguished citizen be dispatch as envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to great|britain furnish with instruction which could not doubt would lead to a conclusion of this long controvert interest upon term acceptable to great|britain upon arrival and before have deliver letter of credence be bet by an order of the british council exclude from and after the|first|of|december now current the vessel of the|united|state from all the colonial british port except those immediately border on territory in answer to expostulation upon a measure thus unexpected be inform that accord to the ancient maxim of policy of european nation have colony trade be an exclusive possession of the mother country that all participation in by other nation be a boon or favor not form a subject of negotiation but to be regulate by the legislative act of the power own the colony that the british government therefore decline negotiate concern and that as the u.s. do not forthwith accept purely and simply the term offer by the act of parliament|of|1825–07 great|britain would not now admit the vessel of the|united|state even upon the term on which have open to the navigation of other nation have be accustom to consider the trade which have enjoy with the british colony rather as an interchange of mutual benefit than as a mere favor receive that under every circumstance have give an ample equivalent have see every other nation hold colony negotiate with other nation and grant freely admission to the colony by treaty and so far be the other colonize nation of europe now from refuse to negotiate for trade with colony that have secure access to the colony of of by treaty the refusal however of great|britain to negotiate leaf to the|united|state no other alternative than that of regulate or interdict altogether the trade on part accord as either measure may effect the interest of own country and with that exclusive object would recommend the whole subject to calm and candid deliberation be hope that unavaile exertion to accomplish a cordial good understanding on this interest will not have an unpropitious effect upon the other great topic of discussion between the government northeastern and northwestern boundary be still unadjusted the commissioner under the seventh article of have nearly come to the close of labor nor can renounce the expectation enfeeble as be that may agree upon report to the satisfaction or acquiescence of both party the commission for liquidate the claim for indemnity for slave carry away after the close of the war have be sit with doubtful prospect of success proposition of compromise have however pass between the government the result of which flatter may yet prove unsatisfactory own disposition and purpose toward great|britain be all friendly and conciliatory nor can abandon but with strong reluctance the belief that will ultimately meet a return not of favor which neither as nor desire but of equal reciprocity and good will with the american government of this hemisphere continue to maintain an intercourse altogether friendly and between nation and our that commercial interchange of which mutual benefit be the source of mutual comfort and harmony the result be in a continual state of improvement the war between spain and since the total expulsion of the spanish military force from continental territory have be little more than nominal and internal tranquillity though occasionally menace by the agitation which civil war never fail to leave behind have not be affect by any serious calamity the congress of minister from several of those nation which assemble at panama after a short session there adjourn to meet again at a more favorable season in the neighborhood of mexico the decease of of minister on way to the isthmus and the impediment of the season which delay the departure of the other deprived united|state of the advantage of be represent at the first meeting of the congress there be however no reason to believe that any transaction of the congress be of a nature to affect injuriously the interest of the|united|state or to require the interposition of minister have be present absence have indeed deprived united|state of the opportunity of possess precise and authentic information of the treaty which be conclude at panama and the whole result have confirm in the conviction of the expediency to the|united|state of be represent at the congress the survive member of the mission appoint during last session have accordingly proceed to destination and a successor to distinguished and lamented associate will be nominate to the senate a treaty of amity navigation and commerce have in the course of the|last|summer be conclude by minister plenipotentiary at mexico with the united state of that confederacy which will also be lay before the senate for advice with regard to ratification in advert to the present condition of fiscal concern and to the prospect of revenue the first remark that call attention be that be less exuberantly prosperous than be at the corresponding period of the|last|year the severe shock so extensively sustain by the commercial and manufacturing interest in great|britain have not be without a perceptible recoil upon a reduced importation from abroad be necessarily succeed by a reduce return to the treasury at home the net revenue of the|present|year will not equal that of the last and the receipt of that which be to come will fall short of those in the|current|year the diminution however be in part attributable to the flourishing condition of some of domestic manufacture and so far be compensate by an equivalent more profitable to the nation be also highly gratify to perceive that the deficiency in the revenue while scarcely exceed the anticipation of the|last|year 's estimate from the treasury have not interrupt the application of during the|present|year to the discharge of the principal and interest of the debt nor the reduction of upward of of the capital of the debt the balance in the treasury on the|first|of|january last be the receipt from that time to the|30th|of|september last be the receipt of the|current|quarter estimate at yield with the sum already receive a revenue of about|$25,500,000 for the|year the expenditure for the|first|three|quarters|of|the|year have amount to the expenditure of the|current|quarter be expect include the of the principal of the debt to be pay to balance the receipt so that the expense of the|year amount to upward of less than income will leave a proportionally increase balance in the treasury on over that of the|first|of|january|last instead of there will be the amount of duty secure on merchandise import from the commence of the year til september|30 be estimate at and the amount that will probably accrue during the|present|quarter be estimate at make for the whole year from which the draw back be deduct will leave a clear revenue from the custom receivable in the|year|1827 of about|$20,400,000 which with the sum to be receive from the proceed of public land the bank dividend and other incidental receipt will form an aggregate of about|$23,000,000 a sum fall short of the whole expense of the|present|year little more than the portion of those expenditure apply to the discharge of the public debt beyond the annual appropriation of by the act of at the passage of that act the public debt amount to on the|first|of|january next will be short of in the lapse of these|10|years|$50,000,000 of public debt with the annual charge of upward of of interest upon have be extinguish at the passage of tat act of the annual appropriation of be absorb in the payment of interest and not more|than|$3,000,000 go to reduce the capital of the debt of the same at this time scarcely be applicable to the interest and upward of be effective in melt down the capital yet experience have prove that a revenue consist so largely of impost and tonnage ebb and flow to an extraordinary extent with all the fluctuation incident to the general commerce of the world be within recollection that even in the compass of the same last|10|year the receipt of the treasury be not adequate to the expenditure of the|year and that in two|successive|years be find necessary to resort to loan to meet the engagement of the nation the return tide of the succeed year replenish the public coffer until have again begin to feel the vicissitude of a decline to produce these alternation of fullness and exhaustion the relative operation of abundant or unfruitful season the regulation of foreign government political revolution the prosperous or decay condition of manufacture commercial speculation and many other cause not always to be trace variously combine have find the alternate swell and diminution embrace period of from two|to|three|years the last period of depression to united|states be from the corresponding revival be from to the commencement of the|present|year still have no cause to apprehend a depression comparable to that of the former period or even to anticipate a deficiency which will intrench upon the ability to apply the annual to the reduction of the debt be well for however to be admonish of the necessity of abide by the maxim of the most vigilant economy and of resort to all honorable and useful expedient for pursue with steady and inflexible perseverance the total discharge of the debt besides the of the loan of which will have be discharge in the course of the|present|year there be which by the term of the contract would have be and be now redeemable more of the loan of will become redeemable from and after the expiration of the|present|month and other from and after the close of the|ensuing|year constitute a mass of all bear an interest of more|than|$20,000,000 of which will be immediately redeemable and the rest within little|more|than|a|year leave of this amount to continue at the interest of but to be pay off as far as shall be find practicable in there be scarcely a doubt that the remain might within a|few|month be discharge by a loan at not exceed redeemable in by this operation a sum of may be save to the nation and the discharge of the whole within the|four|years may be greatly facilitate if not wholly accomplished by an act of congress of a loan for the purpose now refer to or a subscription to stock be authorize at an interest not exceed but at that time so large a portion of the float capital of the country be absorb in commercial speculation and so little be leave for investment in the stock that the measure be but partially successful at the last session of congress the condition of the fund be still unpropitious to the measure but the change so soon afterwards occur that have the authority exist to redeem the now redeemable by an exchange of stock or a loan at be morally certain that may have be effect and with a yearly saving of with regard to the collection of the revenue of impost certain occurrence have within the|last|year be disclose in or of principal port which engage the attention of congress at last session and may hereafter require further consideration until within a|very|few|years the execution of the law for raise the revenue like that of all other law have be insure more by the moral sense of the community than by the rigor of a jealous precaution or by penal sanction confide in the exemplary punctuality and unsullied integrity of import merchant a gradual relaxation from the provision of the collection law a close adherence to which have cause inconvenience and expense to have long become habitual and indulgence have be extend universally because have never be abuse may be worthy of serious consideration whether some further legislative provision may not be necessary to come in aid of this state of unguarded security from the report herewith communicate of the|secretaries|of|war and of the navy with the subsidiary document annex to will be discover the present condition and administration of military establishment on the land and on the sea the organization of the army have undergo no change since reduction to the present peace establishment in remain only to observe that be yet find adequate to all the purpose for which a permanent armed force in time of peace can be need or useful may be proper to add that from a difference of opinion between the late president of the|united|state and the senate with regard to the construction of the act of congress of to reduce and fix the military peace establishment of the u.s. remain hitherto so far without execution that no colonel have be appoint to command of the regiment of artillery a supplementary or explanatory act of the legislature appear to be the only expedient practicable for remove the difficulty of this appointment in a period of profound peace the conduct of the mere military establishment form but a very inconsiderable portion of the duty devolve upon the administration of will be see by the return from the subordinate department of the army that every branch of the service be mark with order regularity and discipline that from the commanding general through all the gradation of superintendence the officer feel to have be citizen before be soldier and that the glory of a republican army must consist in the spirit of freedom by which be animate and of patriotism by which be impel may be confidently state that the moral character of the army be in a state of continual improvement and that all the arrangement for the disposal of part have a constant reference to that end but to be attribute other duty have indeed relation to a future possible condition of war but be purely defensive and in tendency contribute rather to the security and permanency of peace the erection of the fortification provide for by congress and adapt to secure shore from hostile invasion the distribution of the fund of public gratitude and justice to the pensioner of the|revolutionary|war the maintenance of relation of peace and protection with the indian tribe and the internal improvement and survey for the location of road and canal which during the last session of congress have engage so much of attention and may engross so large a share of future benefaction to country by the|act|of|1824 suggest and approve by predecessor the sum of be appropriate for the purpose of cause to be make the necessary survey plan and estimate of the route of such road and canal as the president of the|united|state may deem of national importance in a commercial or military point of view or necessary for the transportation of the public mail the survey plan and estimate for each when complete will be lay before congress in execution of this act a board of engineer be immediately institute and have be since most assiduously and constantly occupy in carry into effect the first object to which labor be direct by order of the late president be the examination of the country between the tide water of the potomac the ohio and lake|erie to ascertain the practicability of a communication between to designate the most suitable route for the same and to form plan and estimate in detail of the expense of execution on make first report which be immediately communicate to congress and in which declare that have maturely consider the circumstance observe by personally and carefully study the result of such of the preliminary survey as be then complete be decidedly of opinion that the communication be practicable at the last session of congress before the board of engineer be enable to make up second report contain a general plan and preparatory estimate for the work the|committee|of|the|house|of|representativ upon road and canals close the session with a report express the hope that the plan and estimate of the board of engineer may at this time be prepare and that the subject be refer to the early and favorable consideration of congress at present session that expect report of the board of engineer be prepared and will forthwith be lay before under the resolution of congress authorize the secretary of war to have prepare a complete system of cavalry tactic and a system of exercise and instruction of field artillery for the use of the militia of the u.s. to be report to congress at the present session a board of distinguished officer of the army and of the militia have be convene whose report will be submit to with that of the secretary of war the occasion be think favorable for consult the same board aid by the result of a correspondence with the governor of the several state and territory and other citizen of intelligence and experience upon the acknowledge defective condition of militia system and of the improvement of which be susceptible the report of the board upon this subject be also submit for consideration in the estimate of appropriation for the|ensuing|year upward of will be submit for the expenditure to be pay from less|than|two fifth of this will be applicable to the maintenance and support of the army in the form of pension go as a scarcely adequate tribute to the service and sacrifice of a former age and a more than equal sum invest in fortification or for the preparation of internal improvement provide for the quiet the comfort and happy existence of the age to come the appropriation to indemnify those unfortunate remnant of another race unable alike to share in the enjoyment and to exist in the presence of civilization though swell in recent|years to a magnitude burdensome to the treasury be generally not without equivalent in profitable value or serve to discharge the union from engagement more burdensome than debt in like manner the estimate of appropriation for the|navy|department will present an aggregate sum of upward of of these however cover the current expenditure of the navy in actual service and half constitute a fund of national property the pledge of future glory and defense be scarcely short year after the close of the late war and when the burden of expense and charge be weigh heaviest upon the country that congress by the act of appropriate annually for eight|year to the gradual increase of the navy at a subsequent period this annual appropriation be reduce to for six|year of which the|present|year be the last a yet more recent appropriation the|last|two|year for build sloop of war have nearly restore the original appropriation of of for every|year the result be before united|stat all have line of battle ship frigate and sloop of war in proportion which with a|few|months preparation may present a line of float fortification along the whole range of coast ready to meet any invader who may attempt to set foot upon shore combine with a system of fortification upon the shore commence about the same time under the auspex of immediate predecessor and hitherto systematically pursue have place in possession the most effective sinew of war and have leave at once an example and a lesson from which own duty may be infer the gradual increase of the navy be the principle of which the act of be the first development be the introduction of a system to act upon the character and history of country for an indefinite series of age be a declaration of that congress to constituent and to posterity that be the destiny and the duty of these confederate state to become in regular process of time and by no petty advance a great naval power that which propose to accomplish in eight|years be rather to be consider as the measure of mean that the limitation of design look forward for a term of year sufficient for the accomplishment of a definite portion of purpose and leave to successor to fill up the canvas of which have trace the large and prophetic outline the ship of the line and frigate which have in contemplation will be shortly complete the time which have allot for the accomplishment of the work have more than elapse remain for consideration how successor may contribute portion of toil and of treasure for the benefit of the succeed age in the gradual increase of navy there be perhaps no part of the exercise of the constitutional power of the federal government which have give more general satisfaction to the people of the union than this the system have not be thus vigorously introduce and hitherto sustained to be now depart from or abandon in continue to provide for the gradual increase of the navy may not be necessary or expedient to add for the present any more to the number of ship but should deem advisable to continue the yearly appropriation of to the same object may be profitably expend in a provide a supply of timber to be season and other material for future use in the construction of dock or in lay the foundation of a school for naval education as to the wisdom of congress either of those measure may appear to claim the preference of the small portion of this navy engage in actual service during the peace squadron have continue to be maintain in in the west india sea and in the mediterranean to which have be add a small armament to cruise on the eastern coast of in all have afford protection to commerce have contribute to make country advantageously know to foreign nation have honorably employ multitude of sea man in the service of country and have inure number of youth of the rise generation to life of manly hardihood and of nautical experience and skill the piracy with which the west|india sea be for several|year infest have be totally suppress but in the mediterranean have increase in a manner afflictive to other nation and but for the continue presence of squadron would probably have be distress to own the war which have unfortunately break out between the republic of and the brazilian government have give rise to very great irregularity among the naval officer of the latter by whom principle in relation to blockades and to neutral navigation have be bring forward to which can not subscribe and which own commander have find necessary to resist from the friendly disposition toward the|united|state constantly manifest by the|emperor|of|brazil and the very useful and friendly commercial intercourse between the|united|state and dominion have reason to believe that the just reparation demand for the injury sustain by several of citizen from some of officer will not be withhold abstract from the recent dispatch of the commander of several squadron be communicate with the report of the secretary of the navy to congress a report from the|postmaster|general be likewise communicate present in a highly satisfactory manner the result of a vigorous efficient and economical administration of that department the revenue of the office even of the|year include the|latter|half|of|1824 and the|first|half|of|1825 have exceed expenditure by a sum of that of the succeed year have be still more productive the increase of the receipt in the|year|preceding|the|first|of|july|last over that of the|year before exceed and the excess of the receipt over the expenditure of the|year have swell from to yearly during the same period contract for additional transportation of the mail in stage for about|260,000|mile have be make and for 70,000|mile annually on horse back new post office have be establish within the|year and the increase of revenue within as well as the augmentation of the transportation by mail be more than equal to the whole amount of receipt and of mail conveyance at the commencement of the|present|century when the seat of the general government be remove to this place when reflect that the object effect by the transportation of the mail be among the choice comfort and enjoyment of social life be pleasing to observe that the dissemination of to every corner of country have outstrip in increase even the rapid march of population by the treaty with france and spain respectively cede louisiana and the floridas to the|united|state provision be make for the security of land title derive from the government of those nation some progress have be make under the authority of various act of congress in the ascertainment and establishment of those title but claim to a very large extent remain unadjusted the public faith no less than the just right of individual and the interest of the community appear to require further provision for the speedy settlement of those claim which therefore recommend to the care and attention of the legislature in conformity with the provision of the act of to provide for erect a penitentiary in and for other purpose commissioner be appoint to select a site for the erection of a penitentiary for the district and also a site in the county of alexandria for a county jail both of which object have be effect the building of the penitentiary have be commence and be in such a degree of forwardness as to promise that will be complete before the meeting of the next congress this consideration point to the expediency of mature at the present session a system for the regulation and government of the penitentiary and of define a system for the regulation and government of the penitentiary and of define the class of offense which shall be punishable by confinement in this edifice in close this communication trust that will not be deem inappropriate to the occasion and purpose upon which be here assemble to indulge a momentary retrospect combine in a single glance the period of origin as a national confederation with that of present existence at the precise interval of half|a|century from each other since last meeting at this place the 50th anniversary of the|day when independence be declare have be celebrate throughout land and on that|day while every heart be bound with joy and every voice be tune to gratulation amid the blessing of freedom and independence which the sire of a former age have hand down to child of the principal actor in that solemn scene the hand that pen the ever memorable declaration and the voice that sustain in debate be by summon at the distance of from each other call before the judge of all to account for deed do upon earth depart cheer by the benediction of country to whom leave the inheritance of fame and the memory of bright example if turn thought to the condition of country in the contrast of the first and last|day|of|that|half|century how resplendent and sublime be the transition from gloom to glory then glance through the same lapse of time in the condition of the individual see the|first|day mark with the fullness and vigor of youth in the pledge of life fortune and sacred honor to the cause of freedom and of mankind and on the last extend on the bed of death with but sense and sensibility leave to breathe a last aspiration to heaven of blessing upon country may not humbly hope that to too be a pledge of transition from gloom to glory and that while mortal vestment be sink into the clod of the valley emancipate spirit be ascend to the bosom of god transcript fellow citizen of the senate and of the|house|of|representatives in take a general survey of the concern of beloved country with reference to subject interesting to the common welfare the first sentiment which impress upon the mind be of gratitude to the omnipotent disposer of all good for the continuance of the signal blessing of providence and especially for that health which to an unusual extent have prevail within border and for that abundance which in the vicissitude of the season have be scatter with profusion over land nor ought less to ascribe to him the glory that be permit to enjoy the bounty of hand in peace and tranquillity in peace with all the other nation of the earth in tranquillity among self there have indeed rarely be a period in the history of civilized man in which the general condition of the christian nation have be mark so extensively by peace and prosperity europe with a few partial and unhappy exception have enjoy of peace during which all government what ever the theory of constitution may have be be successively teach to feel that the end of institution be the happiness of the people and that the exercise of power among man can be justify only by the blessing confer upon those over whom be extend during the same period intercourse with all those nation have be pacific and friendly so continue since the close of last session no material variation have occur in relation with any of in the commercial and navigation system of important change of municipal regulation have recently be sanction by act of parliament the effect of which upon the interest of other nation and particularly upon our have not yet be fully develop in the recent renewal of the diplomatic mission on both side between the government assurance have be give and receive of the continuance and increase of the mutual confidence and cordiality by which the adjustment of many point of difference have already be effect and which afford the sure pledge for the ultimate satisfactory adjustment of those which still remain open or may hereafter arise the policy of the|united|state in commercial intercourse with other nation have always be of the most liberal character in the mutual exchange of respective production have abstain altogether from prohibition have interdict the power of lay taxis upon export and when ever have favor own shipping by special preference or exclusive privilege in own port have be only with a view to countervail similar favor and exclusion grant by the nation with whom have be engage in traffic to own people or shipping and to the disadvantage of immediately after the close of the last war a proposal be fairly make by the act of congress of to all the maritime nation to lay aside the system of retaliate restriction and exclusion and to place the shipping of both party to the common trade on a footing of equality in respect to the duty of tonnage and impost this offer be partially and successively accept by great|britain sweden the netherlands the hanseatic city prussia sardinia the duke of oldenburg and russia be also adopt under certain modification in late commercial convention with france and by the act of congress of have receive a new confirmation with all the nation who have accede to and have be offer again to all those who be or may here after be willing to abide in reciprocity by but all these regulation whether establish by treaty or by municipal enactment be still subject to important restriction the removal of discriminate duty of tonnage and of impost be limit to article of the growth produce or manufacture of the country to which the vessel belong or to such article as be most usually first ship from port will deserve the serious consideration of congress whether even this remnant of restriction may not be safely abandon and whether the general tender of equal competition make in the|act|of|1824 may not be extend to include all article of merchandise not prohibit of what country so ever may be the produce or manufacture proposition of this effect have already be make to by european government and be probable that if once establish by legislation or compact with any distinguished maritime state would recommend by the experience of advantage to the general accession of all the convention of commerce and navigation between the|united|state and france conclude on be in the understanding and intent of both party as appear upon face only a temporary arrangement of the point of difference between of the most immediate and press urgency be limit in the first instance to two|year from but with a proviso that should further continue in force til the conclusion of a general and definitive treaty of commerce unless terminate by a notice six|month in advance of either of the party to the other operation so far as extend have be mutually advantageous and still continue in force by common consent but leave unadjusted several object of great interest to the citizen and subject of both country and particularly a mass of claim to considerable amount of citizen of the|united|state upon the government of france of indemnity for property take or destroy under circumstance of the most aggravated and outrageous character in the long period during which continual and earnest appeal have be make to the equity and magnanimity of france in behalf of these claim justice have not be as could not be deny be hope that the accession of a new sovereign to the throne would have afford a favorable opportunity for present to the consideration of government have be present and urge hither to without effect the repeated and earnest representation of minister at the|court|of|france remain as yet even without an answer be the demand of nation upon the justice of each other susceptible of adjudication by the sentence of an impartial tribunal those to which now refer would long since have be settle and adequate indemnity would have be obtain there be large amount of similar claim upon the netherlands naples and denmark for those upon spain prior to indemnity be after many|year of patient forbearance obtain and those upon sweden have be lately compromise by a private settlement in which the claimant have acquiesce the government of denmark and of naples have be recently remind of those yet exist against nor will any of be forget while a hope may be indulge of obtain justice by the mean within the constitutional power of the executive and without resort to those mean of self redress which as well as the time circumstance and occasion which may require be within the exclusive competency of the legislature be with great satisfaction that be enable to bear witness to the liberal spirit with which the|republic|of|colombia have make satisfaction for well establish claim of a similar character and among the document now communicate to congress will be distinguish a treaty of commerce and navigation with that republic the ratification of which have be exchange since the last recess of the legislature the negotiation of similar treaty with all of the independent south|american state have be contemplate and may yet be accomplish the basis of all as propose by the|united|state have be lay in principle the of entire and unqualified reciprocity the other the mutual obligation of the party to place each other permanently upon the footing of the most favor nation these principle be indeed indispensable to the effectual emancipation of the american hemisphere from the thralldom of colonize monopoly and exclusion an event rapidly realize in the progress of human affair and which the resistance still oppose in certain part of europe to the acknowledgment of the|southern|american republic as independent state will be believe contribute more effectually to accomplish the time have be and that not remote when some of those state may in anxious desire to obtain a nominal recognition have accept of a nominal independence clog with burdensome condition and exclusive commercial privilege grant to the nation from which have separate to the disadvantage of all other be all now aware that such concession to any european nation would be incompatible with that independence which have declare and maintain among the measure which have be suggest to by the new relation with another result from the recent change in condition be that of assemble at the|isthmus|of|panama a congress at which each of should be represent to deliberate upon object important to the welfare of all the republic of colombia of mexico and of central|america have already depute plenipotentiary to such a meeting and have invite the|united|state to be also represent there by minister the invitation have be accept and minister on the part of the|united|state will be commission to attend at those deliberation and to take part in so far as may be compatible with that neutrality from which be neither intention nor the desire of the other american state that should depart the commissioner under the seventh article of have so nearly complete arduous labor that by the report recently receive from the agent on the part of the|united|state there be reason to expect that the commission will be close at next session appoint for may|22|of|the|ensuing|year the other commission appoint to ascertain the indemnity due for slave carry away from the|united|state after the close of the late war have meet with some difficulty which have delay progress in the inquiry a reference have be make to the british government on the subject which may be hope will tend to hasten the decision of the commissioner or serve as a substitute for among the power specifically grant to congress by the constitution be those of establish uniform law on the subject of bankruptcy throughout the|united|state and of provide for organizing arming and discipline the militia and for govern such part of as may be employ in the service of the|united|state the magnitude and complexity of the interest affect by legislation upon these subject may account for the fact that long and often as both of have occupy the attention and animate the debate of congress no system have yet be devise for fulfil to the satisfaction of the community the duty prescribe by these grant of power to conciliate the claim of the individual citizen to the enjoyment of personal liberty with the effective obligation of private contract be the difficult problem to be solve by a law of bankruptcy these be object of the deep interest to society affect all that be precious in the existence of multitude of person many of in the class essentially dependent and helpless of the age require nurture and of the sex entitle to protection from the free agency of the parent and the husband the organization of the militia be yet more indispensable to the liberty of the country be only by an effective militia that can at once enjoy the repose of peace and bid defiance to foreign aggression be by the militia that be constitute an armed nation stand in perpetual panoply of defense in the presence of all the other nation of the earth to this end would be necessary if possible so to shape organization as to give a more united and active energy there be law establish an uniform militia throughout the|united|state and for arming and equip whole body but be a body of dislocate member without the vigor of unity and have little of uniformity but the name to infuse into this most important institution the power of which be susceptible and to make available for the defense of the union at the short notice and at the small expense possible of time of life and of treasure be among the benefit to be expect from the persevere deliberation of congress among the unequivocal indication of national prosperity be the flourish state of finance the revenue of the|present|year from all principal source will exceed the anticipation of the last the balance in the treasury on the|first|of|january|last be a little short of exclusive of be the moiety of the loan of authorize by the|act|of|1824 the receipt into the treasury from the|1st|of|january|to|the|30th|of|september exclusive of the other moiety of the same loan be estimate at and be expect that those of the|current|quarter will exceed form an aggregate of receipt of nearly|$22,000,000 independent of the loan the expenditure of the|year will not exceed that sum more|than|$2,000,000 by those expenditure nearly|$8,000,000 of the principal of the public debt that have be discharge more than have be devote to the debt of gratitude to the warrior of the revolution a nearly equal sum to the construction of fortification and the acquisition of ordnance and other permanent preparation of national defense to the gradual increase of the navy an equal sum for purchase of territory from the indians and payment of annuity to and upward of for object of internal improvement authorize by special act of the last congress if add to these for payment of interest upon the public debt there remain a sum of which have defray the whole expense of the administration of government in legislative executive and judiciary department include the support of the military and naval establishment and all the occasional contingency of a government coextensive with the union the amount of duty secure on merchandise import since the commencement of the|year be about|$25,500,000 and that which will accrue during the|current|quarter be estimate at from these deduct the drawback estimate at less|than|$7,000,000 a sum exceed will constitute the revenue of the|year and will exceed the whole expenditure of the|year the entire amount of the public debt remain due on the|first|of|january next will be short of by an act of congress of the 3rd of march last a loan of be authorize at or an exchange of stock to that amount of for a stock of to create a fund for extinguish an equal amount of the public debt bear an interest of redeemable in an account of the measure take to give effect to this act will be lay before by the secretary of the treasury as the object which have in view have be but partially accomplish will be for the consideration of congress whether the power with which clothe the executive should not be renew at an|early|day of the present session and under what modification the act of congress of the 3rd of march last direct the secretary of the treasury to subscribe in the name and for the use of the|united|state for share of the capital stock of the chesapeake and delaware|canal|company have be execute by the actual subscription for the amount specify and such other measure have be adopt by that officer under the act as the fulfillment of intention require the late account receive of this important undertaking authorize the belief that be in successful progress the payment into the treasury from the proceed of the sale of the public land during the|present|year be estimate at the actual receipt of the|first|two|quarter have fall very little short of that sum be not expect that the|second|half|of|the|year will be equally productive but the income of the|year from that source may now be safely estimate at the act of congress of to provide for the extinguishment of the debt due to the|united|state by the purchaser of public land be limit in operation of relief to the purchaser to the 10th of april last effect at the|end|of|the|quarter during which expire be to reduce that debt from by the operation of similar prior law of relief from and since that of the debt have be reduce from upward of be exceedingly desirable that should be extinguish altogether and to facilitate that consummation recommend to congress the revival for one|year more of the act of with such provisional modification as may be necessary to guard the public interest against fraudulent practice in the resale of the relinquished land the purchaser of public land be among the most useful of fellow citizen and since the system of sale for cash alone have be introduce great indulgence have be justly extend to those who have previously purchase upon credit the debt which have be contract under the credit sale have become unwieldy and extinction be alike advantageous to the purchaser and to the public under the system of sale mature as have be by experience and adapt to the exigency of the time the land will continue as have become an abundant source of revenue and when the pledge of to the public creditor shall have be redeem by the entire discharge of the national debt the swell tide of wealth with which replenish the common treasury may be make to reflow in unfailing stream of improvement from the atlantic to the condition of the various branch of the public service resort from and administration during the|current|year will be exhibit in the report of the secretary of war and the accompany document herewith communicate the organization and discipline of the army be effective and satisfactory to counteract the prevalence of desertion among the troop have be suggest to withhold from the man a small portion of monthly pay until the period of discharge and some expedient appear to be

most promising of auspex with the improvement of recent invention in the mode of construction and with advantage of a great reduction in the comparative cost of the work the operation of the law relate to the revolutionary pensioner may deserve the renew consideration of congress the act of while make provision for many meritorious and indigent citizen who have serve in the|war|of|independence open a door to numerous abuse and imposition to remedy this the act of exacted proof of absolute indigence which many really in want be unable and all susceptible of that delicacy which be ally to many virtue must be deeply reluctant to give the result have be that some among the least deserving have be retain and some in whom the requisite both of worth and want be combine have be stricken from the list as the number of these venerable relic of an age go by diminish as the decay of body mind and estate of those that survive must in the common course of nature increase should not a more liberal portion of indulgence be deal out to may not the want in most instance be infer from the demand when the service can be prove and may not of human infirmity be spare the mortification of purchase a pittance of relief only by the exposure of own necessity submit to congress the expediency of provide for individual case of this description by special enactment or of revise the act of with a view to mitigate the rigor of exclusion in favor of person to whom charity now bestow can scarcely discharge the debt of justice the portion of the naval force of the union in actual service have be chiefly employ on station the mediterranean the coast of border on the|pacific|ocean and the|west|indy an occasional cruiser have be send to range along the african shore most pollute by the traffic of slave armed vessel have be station on the coast of eastern boundary to cruise along the fishing ground in hudsons|bay and on the coast of labrador and the first service of a new frigate have be perform in restore to native soil and domestic enjoyment the veteran hero whose youthful blood and treasure have freely flow in the cause of country 's independence and whose whole life have be a series of service and sacrifice to the improvement of fellow man the visit of general lafayette alike honorable to and to country close as have commence with the most affecting testimonial of devoted attachment on part and of unbounded gratitude of this people to in return will form here after a pleasing incident in the annal of union give to real history the intense interest of romance and signally mark the unpurchasable tribute of a great nation 's social affection to the disinterested champion of the liberty of humankind the constant maintenance of a small squadron in the mediterranean be a necessary substitute for the humiliating alternative of pay tribute for the security of commerce in that sea and for a precarious peace at the mercy of every caprice of barbary state by whom be liable to be violate an additional motive for keep a respectable force station there at this time be find in the maritime war rage between the greeks and the turks and in which the neutral navigation of this union be always in danger of outrage and depredation a few instance have occur of such depredation upon merchant vessel by privateer or pirate wear the grecian flag but without real authority from the greek or any other government the heroic struggle of the greeks in which warm sympathy as free man and christians have be engage have continue to be maintain with vicissitude of success adverse and favorable similar motif have render expedient the keeping of a like force on the coast of peru and chile on the pacific the irregular and convulsive character of the war upon the shore have be extend to the conflict upon the ocean an active warfare have be keep up for year with alternate success though generally to the advantage of the american patriot but naval force have not always be under the control of own government blockade unjustifiable upon any acknowledge principle of international law have be proclaim by officer in command and though disavow by the supreme authority the protection of own commerce against have be make cause of complaint and erroneous imputation against some of the most gallant officer of navy complaint equally groundless have be make by the commander of the spanish royal force in those sea but the most effective protection to commerce have be the flag and the firmness of own command officer the cessation of the war by the complete triumph of the patriot cause have remove be hope all cause of dissension with party and all vestige of force of the other but an unsettled coast of many degree of latitude form a part of own territory and a flourish commerce and fishery extend to the island of the pacific and to china still require that the protect power of the union should be display under flag as well upon the ocean as upon the land the object of the west india squadron have be to carry into execution the law for the suppression of the african slave trade for the protection of commerce against vessel of piratical character though bear commission from either of the belligerent party for protection against open and unequivocal pirate these object during the|present|year have be accomplish more effectually than at any former period the african slave trade have long be exclude from the use of flag and if some few citizen of country have continue to set the law of the union as well as those of nature and humanity at defiance by persevere in that abominable traffic have be only by shelter under the banner of other nation less earnest for the total extinction of the trade of the active persevere and unremitted energy of captain|warrington and of the officer and man under command on that try and perilous service have be crown with signal success and be entitle to the approbation of country but experience have show that not even a temporary suspension or relaxation from assiduity can be indulge on that station without reproduce piracy and murder in all horror nor be probably that for year to come immensely valuable commerce in those sea can navigate in security without the steady continuance of an armed force devote to protection be indeed a vain and dangerous illusion to believe that in the present or probable condition of human society a commerce so extensive and so rich as could exist and be pursue in safety without the continual support of a military marine the only arm by which the power of this confederacy can be estimate or feel by foreign nation and the only stand military force which can never be dangerous to own liberty at home a permanent naval peace establishment therefore adapt to present condition and adaptable to that gigantic growth with which the nation be advance in career be among the subject which have already occupy the foresight of the last congress and which will deserve serious deliberation navy commence at an early period of present political organization upon a scale commensurate with the incipient energy the scanty resource and the comparative indigence of infancy be even then find adequate to cope with all the power of barbary save the first and with of the principle maritime power of europe at a period of further advancement but with little accession of strength not only sustain with honor the most unequal of conflict but cover and country with unfading glory but be only since the close of the late war that by the number and force of the ship of which be compose could deserve the name of a navy yet retain nearly the same organization as when consist only of frigate the rule and regulation by which be govern earnestly call for revision and the want of a naval school of instruction correspond with the|military|academy at west|point for the formation of scientific and accomplished officer be feel with daily increase aggravation the act of congress of authorize an examination and survey of the harbor of charleston in south|carolina of st.|marys in georgia and of the coast of florida and for other purpose have be execute so far as the appropriation would admit those of the|3rd|of|march last authorize the establishment of a navy yard and depot on the coast of florida in the|gulf|of|mexico and authorize the building of sloop of war and for other purpose be in the course of execution for the particular of which and other object connect with this department refer to the report of the secretary of the navy herewith communicate a report from the|postmaster|general be also submit exhibit the present flourishing condition of that department for the first time for many|years the receipt for the|year|ending|on|the|first|of|july last exceed the expenditure during the same period to the amount of other fact equally creditable to the administration of this department be that in two|year from an improvement of more|than|$185,000 in pecuniary affair have be realize that in the same interval the increase of the transportation of the mail have exceed 1,500,000|mile annually and that new post office have be establish hence appear that under judicious management the income from this establishment may be rely on as fully adequate to defray expense and that by the discontinuance of post road altogether unproductive other of more useful character may be open til the circulation of the mail shall keep pace with the spread of population and the comfort of friendly correspondence the exchange of internal traffic and the light of the periodical press shall be distribute to the remote corner of the union at a charge scarcely perceptible to any individual and without the cost of a dollar to the public treasury upon this first occasion of address the legislature of the union with which have be honor in present to view the execution so far as have be effect of the measure sanction by for promote the internal improvement of country can not close the communication without recommend to calm and persevere consideration the general principle in a more enlarged extent the great object of the institution of civil government be the improvement of the condition of those who be party to the social compact and no government in what ever form constitute can accomplish the lawful end of institution but in proportion as improve the condition of those over whom be establish road and canal by multiply and facilitate the communication and intercourse between distant region and multitude of man be among the most important mean of improvement but moral political intellectual improvement be duty assign by the|author|of|our|existence to social no less than to individual man for the fulfillment of those duty government be invest with power and to the attainment of the end the progressive improvement of the condition of the govern the exercise of delegated power be a duty as sacred and indispensable as the usurpation of power not grant be criminal and odious among the first perhaps the very first instrument for the improvement of the condition of man be knowledge and to the acquisition of much of the knowledge adapt to the want the comfort and enjoyment of human life public institution and seminary of learning be essential so convinced of this be the first of predecessor in this office now first in the memory as live be first in the heart of countryman that once and again in address to the congresses with whom cooperate in the public service earnestly recommend the establishment of seminary of learning to prepare for all the emergency of peace and war a national university and a military academy with respect to the latter have live to the|present|day in turn eye to the institution at west|point would have enjoy the gratification of most earnest wish but in survey the city which have be honor with name would have see the spot of earth which have destine and bequeath to the use and benefit of country as the site for a university still bare and barren in assume station among the civilized nation of the earth would seem that country have contract the engagement to contribute share of mind of labor and of expense to the improvement of those part of knowledge which lie beyond the reach of individual acquisition and particularly to geographical and astronomical science look back to the history only of the|half|century since the declaration of independence and observe the generous emulation with which the government of france great|britain and russia have devote the genius the intelligence the treasure of respective nation to the common improvement of the specie in these branch of science be not incumbent upon to inquire whether be not bind by obligation of a high and honorable character to contribute portion of energy and exertion to the common stock the voyage of discovery prosecute in the course of that time at the expense of those nation have not only redound to glory but to the improvement of human knowledge have be partaker of that improvement and owe for a sacred debt not only of gratitude but of equal or proportional exertion in the same common cause of the cost of these undertaking if the mere expenditure of outfit equipment and completion of the expedition be to be consider the only charge would be unworthy of a great and generous nation to take a second thought one|hundred expedition of circumnavigation like those of cook and la|prouse would not burden the exchequer of the nation fit out so much as the way and mean of defray a single campaign in war but if take into account the life of those benefactor of man kind of which service in the cause of specie be the purchase how shall the cost of those heroic enterprise be estimate and what compensation can be make to or to country for be not by bear in affectionate remembrance be not still more by imitate example by enable country man of own to pursue the same career and to hazard life in the same cause in invite the attention of congress to the subject of internal improvement upon a view thus enlarge be not desire to recommend the equipment of an expedition for circumnavigate the globe for purpose of scientific research and inquiry have object of useful investigation nearer home and to which care

last congress would suggest the expediency of connect the equipment of a public ship for the exploration of the whole north west coast of this continent the establishment of an uniform standard of weight and measure be of the specific object contemplate in the formation of constitution and to fix that standard be on of the power delegate by express term in that instrument to congress the government of great|britain and france have scarcely cease to be occupy with inquiry and speculation on the same subject since the existence of constitution and with have expand into profound laborious and expensive research into the figure of the earth and the comparative length of the pendulum vibrate second in various latitude from the equator to the pole these research have result in the composition and publication of several work highly interesting to the cause of science the experiment be yet in the process of performance some of have recently be make on own shore within the

while have neither observatory nor observer upon half of the globe and the earth revolve in perpetual darkness to unsearche eye when on the first president of the|united|state announce to congress the result of the first enumeration of the inhabitant of this union inform that the return give the pleasing assurance that the population of the|united|state border on person at the distance of from that time the last enumeration five|year since complete present a population border on perhaps of all the evidence of a prosperous and happy condition of human society the rapidity of the increase of population be the most unequivocal but the demonstration of prosperity rest not alone upon this indication commerce wealth and the extent of territory have increase in correspond proportion and the number of independent community associate in federal union have since that time nearly double the legislative representation of the state and people in the houses|of|congress have grow with the growth of constituent body the house which then consist of member now number upward of the senate which consist of member have now but the executive and still more the judiciary department be yet in a great measure confine to primitive organization and be now not adequate to the urgent want of a still grow community the naval armament which at an early period force upon the necessity of the union soon lead to the establishment of a|department|of|the|navy but the|departments|of|foreign|affair and of the interior which early after the formation of the government have be unite in continue so united to this time to the unquestionable detriment of the public service the multiplication of relation with the nation and government of the old world have keep pace with that of population and commerce while within the|last|10|year a new family of nation in own hemisphere have arise among the inhabitant of the earth with whom intercourse commercial and political would of furnish occupation to an active and industrious department the constitution of the judiciary experimental and imperfect as be even in the infancy of exist government be yet more inadequate to the administration of national justice at present maturity nine|year have elapse since a predecessor in this office now not the last the citizen who perhaps of all other throughout the union contribute most to the formation and establishment of constitution in valedictory address to congress immediately precede retirement from public life urgently recommend the revision of the judiciary and the establishment of an additional executive department the exigency of the public service and unavoidable deficiency as now in exercise have add yearly cumulative weight to the consideration present by as persuasive to the measure and in recommend to deliberation be happy to have the influence of this high authority in aid of the undoubting conviction of own experience the law relate to the administration of the|patent|office be deserve of much consideration and perhaps susceptible of some improvement the grant of power to regulate the action of congress upon this subject have specify both the end to be obtain and the mean by which be to be effect to promote the progress of science and useful art by secure for limited time to author and inventor the exclusive right to respective writing and discovery if an honest pride may be indulge in the reflection that on the record of that office be already find invention the usefulness of which have scarcely be transcend in the annal of human ingenuity would not exultation be

that a marble monument should be erect by the|united|state in the capitol at the city of washington that the family of general|washington should be request to permit body to be deposit under and that the monument be so design as to commemorate the great event of military and political life in remind congress of this resolution and that the monument contemplate by remain yet without execution shall indulge only the remark that the work at the capitol be approach to completion that the consent of the family desire by the resolution be request and obtain that a monument have be recently erect in this city over the remain of another distinguished patriot of the revolution and that a spot have be reserve within the wall where be deliberate for the benefit of this and future age in which the mortal remain may be deposit of whose spirit hover over and listen with delight to every act of the representative of nation which can tend to exalt and adorn and country the constitution under which be assemble be a charter of limited power after full and solemn deliberation upon all or any of the object which urge by an irresistible sense of own duty have recommend to attention should come to the conclusion that however desirable in the enactment of law for effect would transcend the power commit to by that venerable instrument which be all bind to support let no consideration induce to assume the exercise of power not grant to by the people but if the power to exercise exclusive legislation in all case what so ever over if the power to lay and collect taxis duty impost and excise to pay the debt and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the|united|states if the power to regulate commerce with foreign nation and among the several states and with the indian tribe to

slumber in indolence or fold up arm and proclaim to the world that be palsy by the will of constituent would not be to cast away the bounty of providence and doom to perpetual inferiority in the course of the|year now draw to close have behold under the auspex and at the expense of state of this union a new university unfold portal to the son of science and hold up the torch of human improvement to eye that seek the light have see under the persevering and enlighten enterprise of another state the water of western lake mingle with those of the ocean if undertaking like these have be accomplish in the compass of a|few|year by the authority of single member of confederation can the representative authority of the whole union fall behind fellow servant in the exercise of the trust commit to for the benefit of common sovereign by the accomplishment of work important to the whole and to which neither the authority nor the resource of any state can be adequate finally fellow citizen shall await with cheer hope and faithful cooperation the result of deliberation assure that without encroach upon the power reserve to the authority of the respective state or to the people will with a due sense of obligation to country and of the high responsibility weigh upon yourself give efficacy to the mean commit to for the common good and may who search the heart of the child of man prosper exertion to secure the blessing of peace and promote the high welfare of country transcript to the senate of the|united|state in the message to both houses of congress at the commencement of the session be mention that the government of the republics of colombia of mexico and of central|america have severally invite the|government|of|the|united|state to be represent at the congress of american nation to be assemble at panama to deliberate upon object of peculiar concernment to this hemisphere and that this invitation have be accept although this measure be deem to be within the constitutional competency of the executive have not think proper to take any step in before ascertain that opinion of expediency will concur with that of both branch of the legislature first by the decision of the senate upon the nomination to be lay before and secondly by the sanction of both houses to the appropriation without which can not be carry into effect a report from the secretary of state and copy of the correspondence with the|south|american|government on this subject since the invitation give by be herewith transmit to the senate will disclose the object of importance which be expect to form a subject of discussion at this meeting in which interest of high importance to this union be involve will be see that the|united|state neither intend nor be expect to take part in any deliberation of a belligerent character that the motive of attendance be neither to contract alliance nor to engage in any undertaking or project import hostility to any other nation but the southern|american nation in the infancy of independence often find in position with reference to other country with the principle applicable to which derivable from the state of independence have not be familiarize by experience the result of this have be that sometimes in intercourse with the|united|state have manifest disposition to reserve a right of grant special favor and privilege to the spanish nation as the price of recognition at other have actually establish duty and imposition operate unfavorably to the|united|state to the advantage of other european power and sometimes have appear to consider that may interchange among mutual concession of exclusive favor to which neither european power nor the|united|state should be admit in most of these case regulation unfavorable to have yield to friendly expostulation and remonstrance but be believe to be of infinite moment that the principle of a liberal commercial intercourse should be exhibit to and urge with disinterested and friendly persuasion upon when all assemble for the avowed purpose of consult together upon the establishment of such principle as may have an important bearing upon future welfare the consentaneous adoption of principle of maritime neutrality and favorable to the navigation of peace and commerce in time of war will also form a subject of consideration to this congress the doctrine that free ship make free good and the restriction of reason upon the extent of blockade may be establish by general agreement with far more ease and perhaps with less danger by the general engagement to adhere to concert at such a meeting than by partial treaty or convention with each of the nation separately an agreement between all the party represent at the meeting that each will guard by own mean against the establishment of any future european colony within border may be find advisable this be more|than|two|year since announce by predecessor to the world as a principle result from the emancipation of both the american continent may be so develop to the new southern nation that will all feel as an essential appendage to independence there be yet another subject upon which without enter into any treaty the moral influence of the|united|state may perhaps be exert with beneficial consequence at such a meeting the advancement of religious liberty some of the southern nation be even yet so far under the dominion of prejudice that have incorporate with political constitution an exclusive church without toleration of any other than the dominant sect the abandonment of this last badge of religious bigotry and oppression may be press more effectually by the united exertion of those who concur in the principle of freedom of conscience upon those who be yet to be convince of justice and wisdom than by the solitary effort of a minister to any of the separate government the indirect influence which the|united|state may exercise upon any project or purpose originate in the war in which the southern republics be still engage which may seriously affect the interest of this union and the good office by which the|united|state may ultimately contribute to bring that war to a speedy termination though among the motif which have convince of the propriety of comply with this invitation be so far contingent and eventual that would be improper to dwell upon more at large in fine a decisive inducement with for accede to the measure be to show by this token of respect to the southern republics the interest that take in welfare and disposition to comply with wish have be the first to recognize independence and sympathize with so far as be compatible with neutral duty in all struggle and suffering to acquire have lay the foundation of future intercourse with in the broad principle of reciprocity and the most cordial feeling of fraternal friendship to extend those principle to all commercial relation with and to hand down that friendship to future age be congenial to the high policy of the union as will be to that of all those nation and posterity in the confidence that these sentiment will meet the approbation of the senate nominate richard|c.|anderson of kentucky and john|sergeant of pennsylvania to be envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to the assembly of american nation at panama and william|b.|rochester of new|york to be secretary to the mission transcript in compliance with an usage coeval with the existence of our|federal|constitution and sanction by the example of predecessor in the career upon which be about to enter appear fellow citizen in presence and in that of heaven to bind by the solemnity of religious obligation to the faithful performance of the duty allot to in the station to which have

instructive lesson for the future of the great political party which have divide the opinion and feeling of country the candid and the just will now admit that both have contribute splendid talent spotless integrity ardent patriotism and disintereste sacrifice to the formation and administration of this government and that both have require a liberal indulgence for a portion of human infirmity and error the revolutionary war of europe commence precisely at the moment when the|united|state first go into operation under this constitution excite a collision of sentiment and of sympathy which kindle all the passion and imbittere the conflict of party till the nation be involve in war and the union be shake to center this time of trial embrace a period of five|and|twenty|years during which the policy of the union in relation with europe constitute the principal basis of political division and the most arduous part of the action of federal|government with the catastrophe in which the war of the|french|revolution terminate and own subsequent peace with great|britain this baneful weed of party strife be uproot from that time no difference of principle connect either with the theory of

the most sanguine anticipation which have be entertain of the public prosperity if look to the whole growth as a nation continue to be rapid beyond example if to the state which compose the same gratifying spectacle be exhibit expansion over the vast territory within limit have be great without indicate any decline in those section from which the emigration have be most conspicuous have daily gain strength by a native population in every quarter a population devote to happy system of government and cherish the bond of union with internal affection experience have already shew that the difference of climate and of industry proceed from that cause inseparable from such vast domain and which under other system may have a repulsive tendency can not fail to produce with under wise regulation the opposite effect what portion want the other may supply and this will be most sensibly feel by the part most distant from each other form thereby a domestic market and an active intercourse between the extreme and throughout every portion of union thus by a happy distribution of power between the national and state government government which rest exclusively on the

every other circumstance a correct view of the actual state of union must be equally gratify to constituent relation with foreign power be of a friendly character although certain interesting difference remain unsettled with some revenue under the mild system of impost and tonnage continue to be adequate to all the purpose of the government agriculture commerce manufacture and navigation flourish fortification be advance in the degree authorize by exist appropriation to maturity and due progress be make in the augmentation of the navy to the limit prescribe for by law for these blessing owe to almighty god from whom derive and with profound reverence most grateful and unceasing acknowledgment in advert to relation with foreign power which be always an object of the high importance have to remark that of the subject which have be bring into discussion with during the present administration some have be satisfactorily terminate other have be suspend to be resume hereafter under circumstance more favorable to success and other be still in negotiation with the hope that may be adjust with mutual accommodation to the interest and to the satisfaction of the respective party have be the invariable object of this government to cherish the most friendly relation with every power and on principle and condition which may make permanent a systematic effort have be make to place commerce with each power on a footing of perfect reciprocity to settle with each in a spirit of candor and liberality all exist difference and to anticipate and remove so far as may be practicable all cause of future variance have be stipulate by the seventh article of the convention of navigation and commerce which be conclude on between the|united|state and france that the say convention should continue in force for two|year from the|first|of|october|of|that|year and for an indefinite term afterwards unless of the party should declare intention to renounce in which event should cease to operate at the|end|of|six|months from such declaration and no such intention have be announce the convention have be find advantageous to both party have since remain and still remain in force at the time when that convention be conclude many interesting subject be leave unsettled and particularly claim to indemnity for spoliation which be commit on commerce in the late war for these interest and claim be in the contemplation of the party to make provision at a|subsequent|day by a more comprehensive and definitive treaty the object have be duly attend to since by the executive but as yet have not be accomplish be hope that a favorable opportunity will present for open a negotiation which may embrace and arrange all exist difference and every other concern in which have a common interest upon the accession of the present king of france an event which have occur since the close of the last session of congress with great|britain commercial intercourse rest on the same footing that do at the last session by the convention of the commerce between the|united|state and the british dominion in europe and the|east|indy be arrange on a principle of reciprocity that convention be confirm and continue in force with slight exception by a subsequent treaty for the term of from the date of the latter the trade with the british colony in the|west|indy have not as yet be arrange by treaty or otherwise to satisfaction an approach to that result have be make by legislative act whereby many serious impediment which have be raise by the party in defense of respective claim be remove an earnest desire exist and have be manifest on the part of this government to place the commerce with the colony likewise on a footing of reciprocal advantage and be hope that the british government see the justice of the proposal and importance to the colony will ere long accede to the commissioner who be appoint for the adjustment of the boundary between the territory of the|united|state and those of great|britain specify in the fifth article of the|treaty|of|ghent have disagree in decision and both government have agree to establish that boundary by amicable negotiation between be hope that may be satisfactorily adjust in that mode the boundary specify by the sixth article have be establish by the decision of the commissioner from the progress make in that provide for by the seventh accord to a report recently receive there be good cause to presume that will be settle in the course of the|ensuing|year be a cause of serious regret that no arrangement have yet be finally conclude between the government to secure by joint cooperation the suppression of the slave trade be the object of the british government in the early stage of the negotiation to adopt a plan for the suppression which should include the concession of the mutual right of search by the ship of war of each party of the vessel of the other for suspect offender this be object to by this government on the principle that as the right of search be a right of war of a belligerent toward a neutral power may have an ill effect to extend by treaty to an offense which have be make comparatively mild to a time of peace anxious however for the suppression of this trade be think advisable in compliance with a resolution of the|house|of|representatives found on an act of congress to propose to the british government an expedient which should be free from that objection and more effectual for the object by make piratical in that mode the enormity of the crime would place the offender out of the protection of government and involve no question of search or other question between the party touch respective right be believe also that would completely suppress the trade in the vessel of both party and by respective citizen and subject in those of other power with whom be hope that the odium which would thereby be attach to would produce a corresponding arrangement and by mean thereof entire extirpation forever a convention to this effect be conclude and sign in london on by plenipotentiary duly authorize by both government to the ratification of which certain obstacle have arise which be not yet entirely remove the difference between the party still remain have be reduce to a point not of sufficient magnitude as be presume to be permit to defeat an object so near to the heart of both nation and so desirable to the friend of humanity throughout the world as objection however to the principle recommend by the|house|of|representatives or at least to the consequence inseparable from and which be understand to apply to the law have be raise which may deserve a reconsideration of the whole subject have think proper to suspend the conclusion of a new convention until the definitive sentiment of congress may be ascertain the document relate to the negotiation be with that intent submit to consideration commerce with sweden have be place on a footing of perfect reciprocity by treaty and with russia the netherlands prussia the free hanseatic city and sardinia by internal regulation on each side found on mutual agreement between the respective government the principle upon which the commercial policy of the|united|state be found be to be trace to an early period be essentially connect with those upon which independence be declare and owe origin to the enlighten man who take the lead in affair at that important epoch be develop in first treaty of commerce with france of and by a formal commission which be institute immediately after the conclusion of revolutionary struggle for the purpose of negotiate treaty of commerce with every european power the first treaty of the|united|state with prussia which be negotiate by that commission afford a signal illustration of those principle the act of congress of adopt immediately after the return of a general peace be a new overture to foreign nation to establish commercial relation with on the basis of free and equal reciprocity that principle have pervade all the act of congress and all the negotiation of the executive on the subject a convention for the settlement of important question in relation to the north|we coast of this continent and adjoin sea be conclude and sign at st.|petersburg on the|5th|day|of|april|last by the minister plenipotentiary of the|united|state and plenipotentiary of the imperial government of russia will immediately be lay before the senate for the exercise of the constitutional authority of that body with reference to ratification be proper to add that the manner in which this negotiation be invite and conduct on the part of the emperor have be very satisfactory the great and extraordinary change which have happen in the government of spain and portugal within the|last|two|year without seriously affect the friendly relation which under all of have be maintain with those power by the|united|state have be obstacle to the adjustment of the particular subject of discussion which have arise with each a resolution of the senate adopt at last session call for information as to the effect produce upon relation with spain by the recognition on the part of the|united|state of the independent government the paper contain that information be now communicate to congress a charge d'affaires have be receive from the independent government of brazil that country heretofore a colonial possession of portugal have some|year since be proclaim by the sovereign of portugal an independent kingdom since return to lisbon a revolution in brazil have establish a new government there with an imperial title at the head of which be place a prince in whom the regency have be vest by the king at the time of departure there be reason to expect that by amicable negotiation the independence of brazil will ere long be recognize by portugal with the remain power of europe with those on the coast of barbary and with all the new south|american state relation be of a friendly character have minister plenipotentiary reside with the|republics|of|colombia and chile and have receive minister of the same rank from columbia guatemala buenos|aires and mexico commercial relation with all those state be mutually beneficial and increasing with the|republic|of|colombia a treaty of commerce have be form of which a copy be receive and the original daily expect a negotiation for a like treaty would have be commence with buenos|aires have not be prevent by the indisposition and lamented decease of mr. rodney minister there and to whose memory the most respectful attention have be shew by the government of that republic an advantageous alteration in treaty with tunis have be obtain by consular agent reside there the official document of which when receive will be lay before the senate the attention of the government have be draw with great solicitude to other subject and particularly to that relate to a state of maritime war involve the relative right of neutral and belligerent in such war most of the difficulty which have experience and of the loss which have sustain since the establishment of independence have proceed from the unsettled state of those right and the extent to which the belligerent claim have be carry against the neutral party be impossible to look back on the occurrence of the late war in europe and to behold the disregard which be pay to right as a neutral power and the waste which be make of commerce by the party to those war by various act of respective government and under the pretext by each that the other have set the example without great mortification and a fix purpose never to submit to the like in future an attempt to remove those cause of possible variance by friendly negotiation and on just principle which should be applicable to all party could be presume be view by none other than as a proof of an earnest desire to preserve those relation with every power in the late war between france and spain a crisis occur in which seem probable that all controvertible principle involve in such war may be bring into discussion and settle to the satisfaction of all party proposition have this object in view have be make to the government of great|britain france russia and of other power which have be receive in a friendly manner by all but as yet no treaty have be form with either for accomplishment the policy will be presume be persevere in and in the hope that may be successful will always be recollect that with of the party to those war and from whom receive those injury seek redress by war from the other by whose then reign government vessel be seize in port as well as at sea and cargo confiscate indemnity have be expect but have not yet be render be under the influence of the latter that vessel be likewise seize by the government of spain holland denmark sweden and naples and from whom indemnity have be claim and be still expect with the exception of spain by whom have be render with both party have abundant cause of war but have no alternative but to resist that which be most powerful at sea and press nearest at home with this all difference be settle by a treaty found on condition fair and honorable to both and which have be so far execute with perfect good faith have be earnestly hope that the other would of own accord and from a sentiment of justice and conciliation make to citizen the indemnity to which be entitle and thereby remove from relation any just cause of discontent on side be estimate that the receipt into the treasury during the|current|year exclusive of loan will exceed which with the sum remain in the treasury at the|end|of|the|last|year amount to will after discharge the current disbursement of the|year the interest on the public debt and upward of of the principal leave a balance of more|than|$3|million in the treasury on the|first|day|of|january|next a large amount of the debt contract during the late war bear an interest of become redeemable in the course of the|ensuing|year than could be discharge by the ordinary revenue the act of the 26th of may authorize a loan of at to meet the same by this arrangement an annual saving will accrue to the public of under the act of the 24th of may last a loan of be authorize in order to meet the award under the florida treaty which be negotiate at par with the|bank|of|the|united|state at the limit of interest fix by the act by this provision the claim of citizen who have sustain so great a loss by spoliation and from whom indemnity have be so long withhold be promptly pay for these advance the public will be amply repay at no distant day by the sale of the land in florida of the great advantage result from the acquisition of the territory in other respect too high an estimate can not be form be estimate that the receipt into the treasury during the|year|1825 will be sufficient to meet the disbursement of the|year include the sum of which be annually appropriate by the act of constitute the sink fund to the payment of the principal and interest of the public debt the whole amount of the public debt on the|first|of|january next may be estimate at inclusive of of the loan authorize by the act of the 26th of may last in this estimate be include a stock of issue for the purchase of that amount of the capital stock of the|bank|of|the|united|state and which as the stock of the bank still hold by the government will at least be fully equal to reimbursement ought not to be consider as constitute a part of the public debt estimate then the whole amount of the public debt at and regard the annual receipt and expenditure of the government a well found hope may be entertain that should no unexpected event occur the whole of the public debt may be discharge in the course of and the government be leave at liberty thereafter to apply such portion of the revenue as may not be necessary for current expense to such other object as may be most conducive to the public security and welfare that the sum applicable to these object will be very considerable may be fairly conclude when be recollect that a large amount of the public revenue have be apply since the late war to the construction of the public building in this city to the erection of fortification along the coast and of arsenal in different part of the union to the augmentation of the navy to the extinguishment of the indian title to large tract of fertile territory to the acquisition of florida to pension to revolutionary officer and soldier and to invalid of the late war on many of these object the expense will annually be diminish and cease at no distant period on most of on the the public debt amount to and notwithstanding the large sum which have be apply to these object have be reduce since that period the last portion of the public debt will be redeemable on and while there be the good reason to believe that the resource of the government will be continually adequate to such portion of as may become due in the interval be recommend to congress to seize every opportunity which may present to reduce the rate of interest on every part thereof the high state of the public credit and the great abundance of money be at this time very favorable to such a result must be very gratify to fellow citizen to witness this flourish state of the public finance when be recollect that no burthen whatever have be impose upon the military establishment in all branch in the performance of the various duty assign to each justify the favorable view which be present of the efficiency of organization at the last session all the appropriation have be regularly apply to the object intend by congress and so far as the disbursement have be make the account have be render and settle without loss to the public the condition of the army as relate to the officer and man in science and discipline be highly respectable the military academy on which the army essentially rest and to which be much indebte for this state of improvement have attain in comparison with any other institution of a like kind a high degree of perfection experience however have shew that the disperse condition of the corps of artillery be unfavorable to the discipline of that important branch of the military establishment to remedy this inconvenience company have be assemble at the fortification erect at old|point|comfort as a school for artillery instruction with intention as shall be perfect in the various duty of that service to order to other post and to supply place with other company for instruction in like manner in this mode a complete knowledge of the science and duty of this arm will be extend throughout the whole corps of artillery but to carry this object fully into effect will require the aid of congress to obtain which the subject be now submit to consideration of the progress which have be make in the construction of fortification for the permanent defense of maritime frontier accord to the plan decide on and to the extent of the exist appropriation the report of the secretary of war which be herewith communicate will give a detailed account final completion can not fail to give great additional security to that frontier and to diminish proportionably the expense of defend in the event of war the provision in several act of congress of the last session for the improvement of the navigation of the mississippi and the ohio of the harbor of presqu'isle on lake|erie and the repair of the plymouth beach be in a course of regular execution and there be reason to believe that the appropriation in each instance will be adequate to the object to carry these improvement fully into effect the superintendence of have be assign to officer of under authorize the president to cause a survey to be make with the necessary plan and estimate of such road and canal as may deem of national importance in a commercial or military point of view or for the transportation of the mail a board have be institute consist of distinguished officer of and a distinguished civil engineer with assistant who have be actively employ in carry into effect the object of the act have carefully examine the route between the potomac and the ohio river between the latter and lake|erie between the alleghany and the susquehannah and the route between the delaware and the raritan barnstable and buzzards|bay and between boston|harbor and narraganset|bay such portion of the|corps|of|topographical|engineer as could be spare from the survey of the coast have be employ in survey the very important route between the potomac and the ohio considerable progress have be make in but the survey can not be complete until the|next|season be gratify to add from the view already take that there be good cause to believe that this great national object may be fully accomplish be contemplate to commence early in the|next|season the execution of the other branch of the act that which relate to road and with the survey of a route from this city through the southern state to new|orleans the importance of which can not be too highly estimate all the officer of both the corps of engineer who could be spare from other service have be employ in explore and survey the route for canal to digest a plan for both object for the great purpose specify will require a thorough knowledge of every part of union and of the relation of each part to the other and of all to the seat of the general government for such a digest will be necessary that the information be full minute and precise with a view to these important object submit to the consideration of the congress the propriety of enlarge both the corps of engineer the military and topographical nee scarcely be remark that the more extensively these corp be engage in the improvement of country in the execution of the power of congress and in aid of the state in such improvement as lie beyond that limit when such aid be desire the happy the effect will be in many view of which the subject be perceptible by profit of science the work will always be well execute and by give to the officer such employment union will derive all the advantage in peace as well as in war from talent and service which can afford in this mode also the military will be incorporate with the civil and unfounded and injurious distinction and prejudice of every kind be do away to the corps this service can not fail to be equally useful since by the knowledge would thus acquire would be eminently better qualified in the event of war for the great purpose for which be institute relation with the indian tribe within limit have not be materially change during the|year the hostile disposition evince by certain tribe on the missouri during the|last|year still continue and have extend in some degree to those on and several party of citizen have be plunder and murder by those tribe in order to establish relation of friendship with congress at the last session make an appropriation for treaty with and for the employment of a suitable military escort to accompany and attend the commissioner at the place appoint for the negotiation this object have not be effect the season be too far advanced when the appropriation be make and the distance too great to permit but measure have be take and all the preparation will be complete to accomplish at an early period in the|next|season believe that the hostility of the tribe particularly on and the lakes be in no small degree owe to the war which be carry on between the tribe reside in that|quarter measure have be take to bring about a general peace among which if successful will not only tend to the security of citizen but be of great advantage to the indians with the exception of the tribe refer to relation with all the other be on the same friendly footing and afford great satisfaction to add that be make steady advance in civilization and the improvement of condition many of the tribe have already make great progress in the art of civilized life this desirable result have be bring about by the humane and persevere policy of the government and particularly by mean of the appropriation for the civilization of the indians there have be establish under the provision of this act school contain scholar who be well instruct in several branch of literature and likewise in agriculture and the ordinary art of life under the appropriation to authorize treaty with the creeks and quaupaw|indians commissioner have be appoint and negotiation be now pende but the result be not yet know for more full information respect the principle which have be adopt for carry into effect the act of congress authorize survey with plan and estimate for canal and road and on every other branch of duty incident to refer to the report of the secretary the squadron in the mediterranean have be maintain in the extent which be propose in the report of the secretary of the navy of the|last|year and have afford to commerce the necessary protection in that sea apprehending however that the unfriendly relation which have exist between algiers and some of the power of europe may be extend to have be think expedient to augment the force there and in consequence a ship of the line have be prepare and will sail in a|few|day to join the force employ in the|gulf|of|mexico and in the neighboring sea for the suppression of piracy have likewise be preserve essentially in the state in which be during the|last|year a persevere effort have be make for the accomplishment of that object and much protection have thereby be afford to commerce but still the practice be far from be suppress from every view which have be take of the subject be think that will be necessary rather to augment than to diminish force in that|quarter there be reason to believe that the piracy now complain of be commit by band of robber who inhabit the land and who by preserve good intelligence with the town and seize favorable opportunity rush forth and fall on unprotected merchant vessel of which make an easy prey the pillage thus take carry to lurk place and dispose of afterwards at price tend to seduce the neighboring population this combination be understand to be of great extent and be the more to be deprecate because the crime of piracy be often attend with the murder of the crew these robber know if any survive lurk place would be expose and be catch and punish that this atrocious practice should be carry to such extent be cause of equal surprise and regret be presume that must be attribute to the relaxed and feeble state of the local government since be not doubt from the high character of the governor of cuba who be well known and much respected here that if have the power would promptly suppress whether those robber should be pursue on the land the local authority be make responsible for these atrocity or any other measure be resort to to suppress be submit to the consideration of congress in execution of the law for the suppression of the slave trade a vessel have be occasionally send from that squadron to the coast of africa with order to return thence by the usual track of the slave ship and to seize any of vessel which may be engage in that trade none have be find and be believe that none be thus employ be well know however that the trade still exist under other flag the health of squadron while at thompsons|island have be much well during the present than be the|last|season some improvement have be make and other be contemplate there which be believe will have a very salutary effect on the pacific commerce have much increase and on that coast as well as on that sea the|united|state have many important interest which require attention and protection be think that all the consideration which suggest the expediency of place a squadron on that sea operate with augmented force for maintain there at least in equal extent for detailed information respect the state of maritime force on each sea the improvement necessary to be make on either in the organization of the naval establishment generally and of the law for well government refer to the report of the secretary of the navy which be herewith communicate the revenue of the|post|office|department have receive a considerable augmentation in the|present|year the current receipt will exceed the expenditure although the transportation of the mail within the|year have be much increase a report of the|postmaster|general which be transmit will furnish in detail the necessary information respect the administration and present state of this department in conformity with a resolution of congress of the last session an invitation be give to general lafayette to visit the|united|state with an assurance that a ship of war should attend at any port of france which may designate to receive and convey across the atlantic whenever may be convenient for to sail decline the offer of the public ship from motif of delicacy but assure that have long intend and would certainly visit union in the course of the|present|year in august last arrive at new|york where be receive with the warmth of affection and gratitude to which very important and disinterested service and sacrifice in revolutionary struggle so eminently entitle a corresponding sentiment have since be manifest in favor throughout every portion of union and affectionate invitation have be give to extend visit to to these have yield all the accommodation in power at every designated point of rendezvous the whole population of the neighboring country have be assemble to greet among whom have excite in a peculiar manner the sensibility of all to behold the survive member of revolutionary contest civil and military who have share with in the toil and danger of the war many of in a decrepit state a more interesting spectacle be believe be never witness because none could be found on purer principle none proceed from high or more disinterested motif that the feeling of those who have fight and bleed with in a common cause should have be much excited be natural there be however circumstance attend these interview which pervade the whole community and touch the breast of every age even the young among there be not an individual present who have not some relative who have not partake in those scene nor an infant who have not hear the relation of but the circumstance which be most sensibly feel and which presence bring forcibly to the recollection of all be the great cause in which be engage and the blessing which have derive from success in the struggle be for independence and liberty public and personal and in this succeed the meeting with who have bear so distinguished a part in that great struggle and from such lofty and disinterested motif could not fail to affect profoundly every individual and of every age be natural that should all take a deep interest in future welfare as do high claim on union be feel and the sentiment universal that should be meet in a generous spirit under these impression invite attention to the subject with a view that regard very important service loss and sacrifice a provision may be make and tender to which shall correspond with the sentiment and be worthy the character of the american people in turn attention to the condition of the civilized world in which the|united|state have always take a deep interest be gratify to see how large a portion of be bless with peace the only war which now exist within that limit be those between turkey and greece in europe and between spain and the new government neighbor in this hemisphere in both these war the cause of independence of liberty and humanity continue to prevail the success of greece when the relative population of the contend party be consider command admiration and applause and that have have a similar effect with the neighboring power be obvious the feeling of the whole civilized world be excite in a high degree in favor may not hope that these sentiment win on the heart of respective government may lead to a more decisive result that may produce an accord among to replace greece on the ground which formerly hold and to which heroic exertion at this|day so eminently entitle with respect to the contest to which neighbor be a party be evident that spain as a power be scarcely feel in these new state have completely achieve independence before be acknowledge by the|united|state and have since maintain with little foreign pressure the disturbance which have appear in certain portion of that vast territory have proceed from internal cause which have origin in former government and have not yet be thoroughly remove be manifest that these cause be daily lose effect and that these new state be settle down under government elective and representative in every branch similar to own in this course ardently wish to persevere under a firm conviction that will promote happiness in this career however have not interfere believe that every people have a right to institute for the government which in judgment may suit best example be before of the good effect of which be neighbor be competent judge and to judgment leave in the expectation that other power will pursue the same policy the deep interest which take in independence which have acknowledge and in enjoyment of all the right incident thereto especially in the very important of institute own government have be declare and be know to the world separate as be from europe by the great atlantic|ocean can have no concern in the war of the european government nor in the cause which produce the balance of power between into whichever scale may turn in various vibration can not affect be the interest of the|united|state to preserve the most friendly relation with every power and on condition fair equal and applicable to all but in regard to neighbor situation be different be impossible for the european government to interfere in concern especially in those allude to which be vital without affect indeed the motive which may induce such interference in the present state of the war between the party if a war may be call would appear to be equally applicable to be gratify to know that some of the power with whom enjoy a very friendly intercourse and to whom these view have be communicate have appear to acquiesce in the augmentation of population with the expansion of union and increase number of state have produce effect in certain branch of system which merit the attention of congress some of arrangement and particularly the judiciary establishment be make with a view to the original state only since then the|united|state have acquire a vast extent of territory new state have be admit into the union and territory have be lay off for other which will likewise be admit at no distant day an organization of the|supreme|court which assign the judge any portion of the duty which belong to the inferior require passage over so vast a space under any distribution of the state that may now be make if not impracticable in the execution must render impossible for to discharge the duty of either branch with advantage to the union the duty of the|supreme|court would be of great importance if decision be confine to the ordinary limit of other tribunal but when be consider that this court decide and in the last resort on all the great question which arise under constitution involve those between the united state individually between the state and the|united|state and between the latter and foreign power too high an estimate of importance can not be form the great interest of the nation seem to require that the judge of the|supreme|court should be exempt from every other duty than those which be incident to that high trust the organization of the inferior court would of course be adapt to circumstance be presume that such an one may be form as would secure an able and faithful discharge of duty and without any material augmentation of expense the condition of the aborigine within limit and especially those who be within the limit of any of the state merit likewise particular attention experience have show that unless the tribe be civilized can never be incorporate into system in any form whatever have likewise show that in the regular augmentation of population with the extension of settlement situation will become deplorable if extinction be not menace some well digest plan which will rescue from such calamity be due to right to the right of humanity and to the honor of the nation civilization be indispensable to safety and this can be accomplish only by degree the process must commence with the infant state through whom some effect may be work on the parental difficulty of the most serious character present to the attainment of this very desirable result on the territory on which now reside to remove from by force even with a view to own security and happiness would be revolt to humanity and utterly unjustifiable between the limit of present state and territory and the|rocky|mountain and mexico there be a vast territory to which may be invite with inducement which may be successful be think if that territory should be divide into district by previous agreement with the tribe now reside there and civil government be establish in each with school for every branch of instruction in literature and the art of civilized life that all the tribe now within limit may gradually be draw there the execution of this plan would necessarily be attend with expense and that not inconsiderable but be doubt whether any other can be devise which would be less liable to that objection or more likely to succeed in look to the interest which the|united|state have on and on the western coast of this continent the propriety of establish a military post at the mouth of or at some other point in that|quarter within acknowledge limit be submit to the consideration of congress commerce and fishery on that sea and along the coast have much increase and be increase be think that a military post to which ship of war may resort would afford protection to every interest and have a tendency to conciliate the tribe to the northwest with whom trade be extensive be think also that by the establishment of such a post the intercourse between western state and territory and the pacific and trade with the tribe reside in the interior on each side of the|rocky|mountain would be essentially promote to carry this object into effect the appropriation of an adequate sum to authorize the employment of a frigate with an officer of to explore the mouth of and the coast contiguous thereto to enable the executive to make such establishment at the most suitable point be recommend to congress be think that attention be also due to the improvement of this city the communication between the public building and in various other part and the ground around those building require be presume also that the completion of the canal from the tiber to the eastern branch would have a very salutary effect great exertion have be make and expense incur by the citizen in improvement of various kind but those which be suggest belong exclusively to the government or be of a nature to require expenditure beyond resource the public lot which be still for sale would be not doubt be more than adequate for these purpose from the view above present be manifest that the situation of the|united|state be in the high degree prosperous and happy there be no object which as a people can desire which do not possess or which be not within reach bless with government the happy which the world ever know with no distinct order in society or divide interest in any portion of the vast territory over which dominion extend have every motive to cling together which can animate a virtuous and enlighten people the great object be to preserve these blessing and to hand down to the late posterity experience ought to satisfy that progress under the most correct and provident policy will not be exempt from danger institution form an important epoch in the history of the civilized world on preservation and in utmost purity everything will depend extend as interest do to every part of the inhabit globe and to every sea to which citizen be carry by industry and enterprise to which be invite by the want of other and have a right to go must either protect in the enjoyment of right or abandon in certain event to waste and desolation attitude be highly interesting as relate to other power and particularly to southern neighbor have duty to perform wrt all to which must be faithful to every kind of danger should pay the most vigilant and unceasing attention remove the cause where may be practicable and be prepared to meet when inevitable against foreign danger the policy of the government seem to be already settle the event of the late war admonish to make maritime frontier impregnable by a well digest chain of fortification and to give efficient protection to commerce by augment navy to a certain extent which have be steadily pursue and which be incumbent upon to complete as soon as circumstance will permit in the event of war be on the maritime frontier that shall be assail be in that|quarter therefore that should be prepared to meet the attack be there that whole force will be call into action to prevent the destruction of town and the desolation and pillage of the interior to give full effect to this policy great improvement will be indispensable access to those work by every practicable communication should be make easy and in every direction the intercourse between every part of union should also be promote and facilitate by the exercise of those power which may comport with a faithful regard to the great principle of constitution with respect to internal cause those great principle point out with equal certainty the policy to be pursue rest on the people as government do state and national with well define power be of the high importance that severally keep within the limit prescribe to fulfil that sacred duty be of equal importance that the movement between be harmonious and in case of any disagreement should any such occur a calm appeal be make to the people and that voice be hear and promptly obey both government be institute for the common good can not fail to prosper while those who make be attentive to the conduct of representative and control measure in the pursuit of these great object let a generous spirit and national view and feeling be indulge and let every part recollect that by cherish that spirit and improve the condition of the other in what relate to welfare the general interest will not only be promote but the local advantage be reciprocate by all can not conclude this communication the last of the kind which shall have to make without recollect with great sensibility and heart feel gratitude the many instance of the public confidence and the generous support which have receive from fellow citizen in the various trust with which have be honor have commence service in early youth and continue since with few and short interval have witness the great difficulty to which union have be surmount from the present prosperous and happy state derive a gratification which can not express that these blessing may be preserve and perpetuate will be the object of fervent and uncease prayer to the|supreme|ruler|of|the|universe transcript of the senate and house|of|representatif many important subject will claim attention during the present session of which shall endeavor to give in aid of deliberation a just idea in this communication undertake this duty with diffidence from the vast extent of the interest on which have to treat and of great importance to every portion of union enter on with zeal from a thorough conviction that there never be a period since the establishment of revolution when regard the condition of the civilized world and bearing on there be great necessity for devotion in the public servant to respective duty or for virtue patriotism and union in constituent meet in a new congress deem proper to present this view of public affair in great detail than may otherwise be necessary do however with peculiar satisfaction from a knowledge that in this respect shall comply more fully with the sound principle of government the people be with exclusively the sovereign be indispensable that full information be lay before on all important subject to enable to exercise that high power with complete effect if keep in the dark must be incompetent to be all liable to error and those who be engage in the management of public affair be more subject to excitement and to be lead astray by particular interest and passion than the great body of constituent who live at home in the pursuit of ordinary avocation be calm but deeply interested spectator of event and of the conduct of those who be party to to the people every department of the government and every individual in each be responsible and the more full information the well can judge of the wisdom of the policy pursue and of the conduct of each in regard to from dispassionate judgment much aid may always be obtain while approbation will form the great incentive and most gratifying reward for virtuous action and the dread of censure the good security against the abuse of confidence interest in all vital question be the same and the bond by sentiment as well as by interest will be proportionably strengthen as be better informed of the real state of public affair especially in difficult conjuncture be by such knowledge that local prejudice and jealousy be surmount and that a national policy extend fostering care and protection to all the great interest of union be form and steadily adhere to a precise knowledge of relation with foreign power as respect negotiation and transaction with each be think to be particularly necessary equally necessary be that should for a just estimate of resource revenue and progress in every kind of improvement connect with the national prosperity and public defense be by render justice to other nation that may expect from be by ability to resent injury and redress wrong that may avoid the commissioner under the 5th article of the treaty of ghent have disagree in opinion respect that portion of the boundary between the territories of the|united|state and of great|britain the establishment of which have be submit to have make respective report in compliance with that article that the same may be refer to the decision of a friendly power be manifest however that would be difficult if not impossible for any power to perform that office without great delay and much inconvenience to a proposal have be make by this government and accede to by that of great|britain to endeavor to establish that boundary by amicable negotiation appear from long experience that no satisfactory arrangement could be form of the commercial intercourse between the|united|state and the british colony in this hemisphere by legislative act while each party pursue own course without agreement or concert with the other a proposal have be make to the|british|government to regulate this commerce by treaty as have be to arrange in like manner the just claim of the citizen of the|united|state inhabit the|state and territories border on the lake and river which empty into the|st.|lawrence to the navigation of that river to the ocean for these and other object of high importance to the interest of both party a negotiation have be open with the|british|government which be hope will have a satisfactory result the commissioner under the 6th and 7th article of the treaty of ghent have successfully close labor in relation to the 6th have proceed to the discharge of those relate to the 7th progress in the extensive survey require for the performance of duty justify the presumption that will be complete in the|ensuing|year the negotiation which have be long depend with the|french|government on several important subject and particularly for a just indemnity for loss sustain in the late war by the citizen of the|united|state under unjustifiable seizure and confiscation of property have not as yet have the desire effect as this claim rest on the same principle with other which have be admit by the|french|government be not perceive on what just grind can be reject a minister will be immediately appoint to proceed to france and resume the negotiation on this and other subject which may arise between the nation at the proposal of the|russian|imperial|government make through the minister of the emperor reside here a full power and instruction have be transmit to the minister of the|united|state at st.|petersburg to arrange by amicable negotiation the respective right and interest of the nation on the north|we coast of this continent a similar proposal have be make by imperial|majesty to the government of great britain which have likewise be accede to the government of the|united|state have be desirous by this friendly proceeding of manifest the great value which have invariably attach to the friendship of the emperor and solicitude to cultivate the good understanding with government in the discussion to which this interest have give rise and in the arrangement by which may terminate the occasion have be judge proper for assert as a principle in which the right and interest of the|united|state be involve that the american continent by the free and independent condition which have assume and maintain be henceforth not to be consider as subject for future colonization by any european power since the close of the last session of congress the commissioner and arbitrator for ascertaining and determine the amount of indemnification which may be due to citizen of the|united|state under the decision of imperial majesty the emperor of russia in conformity to the convention conclude at st.|petersburg on have assemble in this city and organize as a board for the performance of the duty assign to by that treaty the commission constitute under the 11th article of the treaty of between the|united|state and spain be also in session here and as the term of three|year limit by the treaty for the execution of the trust will expire before the period of the next regular meeting of congress the attention of the legislature will be draw to the measure which may be necessary to accomplish the object for which the commission be institute in compliance with a resolution of the|house|of|representatives adopt at last session instruction have be give to all the minister of the|united|state accredit to the power of europe and america to propose the proscription of the african slave trade by class under the denomination and inflict on perpetrator the punishment of piracy should this proposal be accede to be not doubt that this odious and criminal practice will be promptly and entirely suppress be earnestly hope that will be accede to from the firm belief that be the most effectual expedient that can be adopt for the purpose at the commencement of the recent war between france and spain be declare by the|french|government that would grant no commission to privateer and that neither the commerce of spain nor of neutral nation should be molest by the naval force of france except in the breach of a lawful blockade this declaration which appear to have be faithfully carry into effect concur with principle proclaim and cherish by the|united|state from the first establishment of independence suggest the hope that the time have arrive when the proposal for adopt as a permanent and invariable rule in all future maritime war may meet the favorable consideration of the great european power instruction have accordingly be give to minister with france russia and great|britain to make those proposal to respective government and when the friend of humanity reflect on the essential amelioration to the condition of the human race which would result from the abolition of private war on the sea and on the great facility by which may be accomplish require only the consent of a few sovereign an earnest hope be indulge that these overture will meet with an attention animate by the spirit in which be make and that will ultimately be successful the minister who be appoint to the republics of colombia and buenos|ayres during the last session of congress proceed shortly afterwards to destination of arrival there official intelligence have not yet be receive the minister appoint to the|republic|of|chile will sail in a|few|day an early appointment will also be make to mexico a minister have be receive from colombia and the other government have be inform that minister or diplomatic agent of inferior grade would be receive from each accordingly as may prefer the one or the other the minister appoint to spain proceed soon after appointment for cadiz the residence of the sovereign to whom be accredit in approach that port the frigate which convey be warn off by the commander of the french squadron by which be blockade and not permit to enter although apprise by the captain of the frigate of the public character of the person whom have on board the landing of whom be the sole object of propose entry this act be consider an infringement of the right of ambassador and of nation will form a just cause of complaint to the government|of|france against the officer by whom be commit the actual condition of the public finance more than realize the favorable anticipation that be entertain of at the opening of the last session of congress on the|first|of|january there be a balance in the treasury of from that time to the|30th|of|september the receipt amount to upward of m and the expenditure to during the|4th|quarter|of|the|year be estimate that the receipt will at least equal the expenditure and that there will remain in the treasury on the|first|day|of|january next a surplus of nearly|$9m. on a large amount of the war debt and a part of the revolutionary debt become redeemable additional portion of the former will continue to become redeemable annually until the|year|1835 be believe however that if the|united|state remain at peace the whole of that debt may be redeem by the ordinary revenue of those year during that period under the provision of the act of create the sinking fund and in that case the only part of the debt that will remain after the|year|1835 will be the m of % stock subscribe to the|bank|of|the|united|states and the % revolutionary debt amount to both of which be redeemable at the pleasure of the government the state of the army in organization and discipline have be gradually improve for several|year and have now attain a high degree of perfection the military disbursement have be regularly make and the account regularly and promptly render for settlement the supply of various description have be of good quality and regularly issue at all of the post a system of economy and accountability have be introduce into every branch of the service which admit of little additional improvement this desirable state have be attain by the act reorganize the staff of the army pass on 14]. the money appropriate for fortification have be regularly and economically apply and all the work advance as rapidly as the amount appropriate would admit important work will be complete in the course of this|year that is fort|washington fort|delaware and the fort at the rigolets in louisiana the|board|of|engineer and the|topographical|corp have be in constant and active service in survey the coast and project the work necessary for defense the|military|academy have attain a degree of perfection in discipline and instruction equal as be believe to any institution of kind in any country the money appropriate for the use of the|ordnance|department have be regularly and economically apply the fabrication of arm at the national armory and by contract with the department have be gradually improve in quality and cheapness be believe that quality be now such as to admit of but little improvement the completion of the fortification render necessary that there should be a suitable appropriation for the purpose of fabricate the cannon and carriage necessary for those work under the appropriation of for explore the western water for the location of a site for a western armory a commission be constitute consist of colonel mcree colonel lee and captain|talcott who have be engage in explore the country have not yet report the result of labor but be believe that will be prepared to do at an early part of the session of congress during last general ashley and party who be trade under a license from the government be attack by the ricarees while peaceably trade with the indians at request several of the party be kill and wound and property take or destroy colonel leavenworth who command fort|atkinson at the|council|bluff the most western post apprehend that the hostile spirit of the ricarees would extend to other tribe in that|quarter and that thereby the life of the trader on the missouri and the peace of the frontier would be endanger take immediate measure to check the evil with a detachment of the regiment station at the bluffs successfully attack the ricaree village and be hope that such an impression have be make on as well as on the other tribe on the missouri as will prevent a recurrence of future hostility the report of the secretary of war which be herewith transmit will exhibit in great detail the condition of the department in various branch and the progress which have be make in administration during the|three|first|quarters|of|the|year transmit a return of the militia of the several states accord to the last report which have be make by the proper officer in each to by reference to this return will be see that be not complete although great exertion have be make to make so as the defense and even the liberty of the country must depend in time of imminent danger on the militia be of the high importance that be well organized armed and discipline throughout the union the report of the secretary of war shew the progress make during the|three|first|quarters|of|the|present|year by the application of the fund appropriate for arming the militia much difficulty be find in distribute the arm accord to the act of congress provide for from the failure of the proper department in many of the states to make regular return the act of provide that the system of tactic and regulation of the various corps of the|regular|army shall be extend to the militia this act have be very imperfectly execute from the want of uniformity in the organization of the militia proceed from the defect of the system and especially in application to that main arm of the public defense be think that this important subject in all branch merit the attention of congress the report of the secretary of the navy which be now communicate furnish an account of the administration of that department for the|three|first|quarters|of|the|present|year with the progress make in augment the navy and the manner in which the vessel in commission have be employ the usual force have be maintain in the|mediterranean|sea the|pacific|ocean and along the atlantic coast and have afford the necessary protection to commerce in those sea in the|west|indy and naval force have be augment by the addition of several small vessel provide for by the act authorize an additional naval force for the suppression of piracy pass by congress at last session that armament have be eminently successful in the accomplishment of object the piracy by which commerce in the neighborhood of the island of cuba have be afflict have be repress and the confidence of merchant in a great measure restore the patriotic zeal and enterprise of commodore|porter to whom the command of the expedition be confide have be fully second by the officer and man under command and in reflect with high satisfaction on the honorable manner in which have sustain the reputation of country and navy the sentiment be alloy only by a concern that in the fulfillment of that arduous service the disease incident to the season and to the climate in which be discharge have deprive the nation of many useful life and among of several officer of great promise in the|month|of|august a very malignant fever make appearance at thompsons|island which threaten the destruction of station there many perished and the command officer be severely attack uncertain as to fate and know that most of the medical officer have be render incapable of discharge duty be think expedient to send to that post an officer of rank and experience with several skilled surgeon to ascertain the origin of the fever and the probability of recurrence there in future season to furnish every assistance to those who be suffer and if practicable to avoid the necessity of abandon so important a station commodore rodgers with a promptitude which do honor cheerfully accept that trust and have discharge in the manner anticipate from skill and patriotism before arrival commodore|porter with the great part of the squadron have remove from the island and return to the|united|state in consequence of the prevail sickness much useful information have however be obtain as to the state of the island and great relief afford to those who have be necessarily leave there although expedition cooperate with an invigorated administration of the government of the island of cuba and with the corresponding active exertion of a british naval force in the same sea have almost entirely destroy the unlicensed piracy from that island the success of exertion have not be equally effectual to suppress the same crime under other pretense and color in the neighboring island of porto|rico have be commit there under the abusive issue of spanish commission at an early period of the|present|year remonstrance be make to the governor of that island by an agent who be send for the purpose against those outrage on the peaceful commerce of the|united|state of which many have occur that officer profess own want of authority to make satisfaction for just complaint answer only by a reference of to the|government|of|spain the minister of the|united|state to that court be specially instruct to urge the necessity of immediate and effectual interposition of that government direct restitution and indemnity for wrong already commit and interdict the repetition of the minister as have be see be debar access to and in the mean time several new case of flagrant outrage have occur and citizen of the|united|state in the island of porto|rico have suffer and other be threaten with assassination for assert unquestionable right even before the lawful tribunal of the country the usual order have be give to all public ship to seize american vessel in the slave trade and bring in for adjudication and have the gratification to state that not so employ have be discover and there be good reason to believe that flag be now seldom if at all disgrace by that traffic be a source of great satisfaction that be always enable to recur to the conduct of navy with price and commendation as a means of national defense enjoy the public confidence and be steadily assume additional importance be submit whether a more efficient and equally economical organization of may not in several respect be effect be suppose that high grade than now exist by law would be useful would afford well merit reward to those who have long and faithfully serve country present the good incentive to good conduct and the good mean of insure a proper discipline destroy the inequality in that respect between military and naval service and relieve officer from many inconvenience and mortification which occur when vessel meet those of other nation ours be the only service in which such grade do not exist a report of the|postmaster general which accompany this communication will shew the present state of the|post office|department and general operation for some|years|past there be establish by law 88,600|mile of post road on which the mail be now transport and contract have be make for transportation on all the establish route with or exception there be post office in the union and as many post master the gross amount of postage which accrue from to be during the same period the expenditure of the|post office|department amount to and consist of the follow item viz compensation to post master incidental expense transportation of the mail payment into the treasury on the|first|of|july|last there be due to the department from post master from late post master and contractor make a total amount of balance due to the department of balance embrace all delinquency of post master and contractor which have take place since the organization of the department there be due by the department to contractor on the|first|of|july last 26,548.64 the transportation of the mail within five|years|past have be greatly extend and the expenditure of the department proportionably increase although the postage which have accrue within the|last|three|years have fall short of the expenditure appear that collection have be make from the outstanding balance to meet the principal part of the current demand be estimate that not of the above balance can be collect and that a considerable part of this sum can only be realize by a resort to legal process some improvement in the receipt for postage be expect a prompt attention to the collection of money receive by post master be believe will enable the department to continue operation without aid from the treasury unless the expenditure shall be increase by the establishment of new mail route a revision of some part of the post office law may be necessary and be submit whether would not be proper to provide for the appointment of post master where the compensation exceed a certain amount by nomination to the senate as other officer of the|general|government be appoint have communicate view to congress at the commencement of the last session respect the encouragement which ought to be give to manufacture and the principle on which should be found have only to add that those view remain unchanged and that the present state of those country with which have the most immediate political relation and great commercial intercourse tend to confirm under this impression recommend a review of the tariff for the purpose of afford such additional protection to those article which be prepared to manufacture or which be more immediately connect with the defense and independence of the country the actual state of the public account furnish additional evidence of the efficiency of the present system of accountability in relation to the public expenditure of the money draw from the treasury since the sum remain unaccounted for on the|30th|of|september last be m less than on the|30th|of|september precede and during the same period a reduction of nearly|$1 m have be make in the amount of the unsettled account for money advance previously to 04]. will be obvious that in proportion as the mass of account of the latter description be diminish by settlement the difficulty of settle the residue be increase from the consideration that in many instance can be obtain only by legal process for more precise detail on this subject refer to a report from the first comptroller|of|the|treasury the sum which be appropriate at the last session for the repair of the cumberland road have be apply with good effect to that object a final report have not be receive from the agent who be appoint to superintend as soon as be receive shall be communicate to congress many patriotic and enlighten citizen who have make the subject an object of particular investigation have suggest an improvement of still great importance be of the opinion that the water of the chesapeake and ohio may be connect together by continue canal and at an expense far short of the value and importance of the object to be obtain if this could be accomplish be impossible to calculate the beneficial consequence which would result from a great portion of the produce of the very fertile country through which would pass would find a market through that channel troop may be move with great facility in war with cannon and every kind of munition and in either direction connect the atlantic with the western country in a line pass through the seat of the|national|government would contribute essentially to strengthen the bond of union believe as do that congress possess the right to appropriate money for such a national object the jurisdiction remain to the states through which the canal would pass submit to consideration whether may not be advisable to authorize by an adequate appropriation the employment of a suitable number of the officer of the|corps|of|engineers to examine the unexplored ground during the|next|season and to report opinion thereon will likewise be proper to extend examination to the several route through which the water of the ohio may be connect by canal with those of lake|erie as the cumberland road will require annual repair and congress have not think expedient to recommend to the states an amendment to the constitution for the purpose of vest in the|united|state a power to adopt and execute a system of internal improvement be also submit to consideration whether may not be expedient to authorize the executive to enter into an arrangement with the several states through which the road pass to establish toll each within limit for the purpose of defray the expense of future repair and of provide also by suitable penalty for protection against future injury the act of congress of appropriate the sum of for the purpose of erect pier as a shelter for vessel from ice near cape|henlopen delaware|bay to effect the object of the act the officer of the|board|of|engineers with commodore bainbridge be direct to prepare plan and estimate of pier sufficient to answer the purpose intend by the act appear by report which accompany the document from that the appropriation be not adequate to the purpose intend and as the pier would be of great service both to the navigation of the|delaware|bay and the protection of vessel on the adjacent part of the coast submit for the consideration of congress whether additional and sufficient appropriation should not be make the|board|of|engineer be also direct to examine and survey the entrance of the harbor of the port of presquille in pa in order to make an estimate of the expense of remove the obstruction to the entrance with a plan of the good mode of effect the same under the appropriation for that purpose by act of congress pass 3rd|of|march last the report of the board accompany the paper from and be submit for the consideration of congress a strong hope have be long entertain found on the heroic struggle of the greeks that would succeed in contest and resume equal station among the nation of the earth be believe that the whole civilized world take a deep interest in welfare although no power have declare in favor yet none accord to information have take part against cause and name have protect from danger which may ere this have overwhelm any other people the ordinary calculation of interest and of acquisition with a view to aggrandizement which mingle so much in the transaction of nation seem to have have no effect in regard to from the fact which have come to knowledge there be good cause to believe that enemy have lose forever all dominion over that greece will become again an independent nation that may obtain that rank be the object of most ardent wish be state at the commencement of the last session that a great effort be then make in spain and portugal to improve the condition of the people of those country and that appear to be conduct with extraordinary moderation nee scarcely be remark that the result have be so far very different from what be then anticipate of event in that|quarter of the globe with which have so much intercourse and from which derive origin have always be anxious and interested spectator the citizen of the|united|state cherish sentiment the most friendly in favor of the liberty and happiness of fellow man on that side of the atlantic in the war of the european power in matter relate to have never take any part nor do comport with policy so to do be only when right be invade or seriously menace that resent injury or make preparation for defense with the movement in this hemisphere be of necessity more immediately connect and by cause which must be obvious to all enlighten and impartial observer the political system of the ally power be essentially different in this respect from that of america this difference proceed from that which exist in respective government and to the defense of own which have be achieve by the loss of so much blood and treasure and mature by the wisdom of most enlighten citizen and under which have enjoy unexampled felicity this whole nation be devoted owe therefore to candor and to the amicable relation exist between the|united|state and those power to declare that should consider any attempt on part to extend system to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to peace and safety with the exist colony or dependency of any european power have not interfere and shall not interfere but with the government who have declare independence and maintain and whose independence have on great consideration and on just principle acknowledge could not view any interposition for the purpose of oppress or control in any other manner destiny by any european power in any other light than as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the|united|state in the war between those new governments and spain declare neutrality at the time of recognition and to this have adhere and shall continue to adhere provide no change shall occur which in the judgment of the competent authority of this government shall make a corresponding change on the part of the|united|state indispensable to security the late event in spain and portugal shew that europe be still unsettled of this important fact no strong proof can be adduce than that the ally power should have think proper on any principle satisfactory to to have interpose by force in the internal concern of spain to what extent such interposition may be carry on the same principle be a question in which all independent power whose government differ from be interested even those most remote and surely none more so than the|united|state policy in regard to europe which be adopt at an early stage of the war which have so long agitate that quarter of the globe nevertheless remain the same which be not to interfere in the internal concern of any of power to consider the government as the legitimate government for to cultivate friendly relation with and to preserve those relation by a frank firm and manly policy meet in all instance the just claim of every power submit to injury from none but in regard to those continent circumstance be eminently and conspicuously different be impossible that the ally power should extend political system to any portion of either continent without endanger peace and happiness nor can anyone believe that southern brother if leave to would adopt of own accord be equally impossible therefore that should behold such interposition in any form with indifference if look to the comparative strength and resource of spain and those new government and distance from each other must be obvious that can never subdue be still the true policy of the|united|state to leave the party to in the hope that other power will pursue the same course if compare the present condition of union with actual state at the close of revolution the history of the world furnish no example of a progress in improvement in all the important circumstance which constitute the happiness of a nation which bear any resemblance to at the first epoch population do not exceed by the last census amount to and what be more extraordinary be almost altogether native for the immigration from other country have be inconsiderable at the first epoch half the territory within acknowledge limit be uninhabite and a wilderness since then new territory have be acquire of vast extent comprise within many river particularly the mississippi the navigation of which to the ocean be of the high importance to the original states over this territory population have expand in every direction and new states have be establish almost equal in number to those which form the first bond of union this expansion of population and accession of new states to union have have the happy effect on all high interest that have eminently augment resource and add to strength and respectability as a power be admit by all but be not in these important circumstance only that this happy effect be feel be manifest that by enlarge the basis of system and increase the number of states the system have be greatly strengthen in both branch consolidation and disunion have thereby be render equally impracticable each government confide in own strength have less to apprehend from the other and in consequence each enjoy a great freedom of action be render more efficient for all the purpose for which be institute be unnecessary to treat here of the vast improvement make in the system by the adoption of this constitution and of happy effect in elevate the character and in protect the right of the nation as well as individual to what then do owe these blessing be know to all that derive from the excellence of institution ought not then to adopt every measure which may be necessary to perpetuate transcript fellow citizen of the senate and house|of|representatif many cause unite to make present meeting peculiarly interesting to out constituent the operation of law on the various subject to which apply with the amendment which occasionally require impose annually an important duty on the representative of a free people system have happily advanced to such maturity that be not aware that care in that respect will be augment other cause exist which be highly interesting to the whole civilized world and to no portion of more so in certain view than to the|united|state of these cause and of bearing on the interest of union shall communicate the sentiment which have form with that freedom which a sense of duty dictate be proper however to invite attention in the first instance to those concern respect which legislative provision be think to be particularly urgent on last a convention of navigation and commerce be conclude in this city between the|united|state and france by minister duly authorize for the

doubt be entertain whether the act of congress apply to the british colony on this continent as well as to those in the|west|indy but as the act of parliament open the intercourse equally with both and be the manifest intention of congress as well as the obvious policy of the|united|state that the provision of the act of parliament should be meet in equal extent on the part of the|united|state and as also the act of congress be suppose to vest in the president some discretion in the execution of think advisable to give a corresponding construction should the constitutional sanction of the senate be give to the ratification of the convention with france legislative provision will be necessary to carry fully into effect as likewise will be to continue in force on such condition as may be deem just and proper the intercourse which have be open between the|united|state and the british colony every light in the possession of the executive will in due time be communicate on both subject rest essentially on a basis of reciprocal and equal advantage have be the object of the executive in transaction with other power to meet the proposition of each with a liberal spirit believe that thereby the interest of country would be most effectually promote this course have be systematically pursue in the late occurrence with france and great|britain and in strict accord with the view of the legislature a confident hope be entertain that by the arrangement thus commence with each all difference respect navigation and commerce with the dominion in question will be adjust and a solid foundation be lay for an active and permanent intercourse which will prove equally advantageous to both party the decision of imperial majesty the emperor of russia on the question submit to by the|united|state and great|britain concern the construction of the first article of the|treaty|of|ghent have be receive a convention have since be conclude between the party under the mediation of imperial majesty to prescribe the mode by which that article shall be carry into effect in conformity with that decision shall submit this convention to the senate for advice and consent as to the

equal participation in the government with the original state on the condition heretofore prescribe to other territory by a clause in the ninth article of the treaty with spain by which that territory be cede to the|united|state be stipulate that satisfaction shall be make for the injury if any which by process of law shall be establish to have be suffer by the spanish officer and individual spanish inhabitant by the late operation of troop in florida no provision have yet be make to carry that stipulation into effect be submit to the consideration of congress whether will not be proper to vest the competent power in the district court at pensacola or in some tribunal to be specially organize for the purpose the fiscal operation of the|year have be more successful than have be anticipate at the commencement of the last session of congress the receipt into the treasury during the|three|first|quarters|of|the|year have exceed the sum of the payment make at the treasury during

current service of the|year include the interest and reimbursement of the public debt the stock of amount to have be redeem be estimate that after defray the current expense of and redeem the of stock of there will remain in the treasury on the|first|of|january next nearly|$3|million be estimate that the gross amount of duty which have be secure from the|first|of|january|to|the|30th|of|september last have exceed and the amount for the|whole|year will probably not fall short of of the actual force in service under the present military establishment the post at which be station and the condition of each post a report from the secretary of war which be now communicate will give a distinct idea by like report the state of the academy at west|point will be see as will be the progress which have be make on the fortification along the coast and at the national armory and arsenal the organization of the several corps compose the army be such as to admit expansion to a great extent in case of emergency the officer carry with all the light which possess to the new corps to which may be appoint with the organization of the staff there be equal cause to be satisfied by the concentration of every branch with chief in this city in the presence of the department and with a grade in the chief military station to keep alive and cherish a military spirit the great promptitude in the execution of order with the great economy and efficiency be secure the same view be take of the military academy good order be preserve in and the youth be well instruct in every science connect with the great object of the institution be also well train and discipline in the practical part of the profession have be always find difficult to control the ardor inseparable from that early age in such manner as to give a proper direction the right of manhood be too often claim prematurely in press which too far the respect which be due to age and the obedience necessary to a course of study and instruction in every such institution be sometimes lose sight of the great object to be accomplish be the restraint of that ardor by such wise regulation and government as by direct all the energy of the youthful mind to the attainment of useful knowledge will keep within a just subordination and at the same time elevate to the high purpose this object seem to be essentially obtain in this institution and with great advantage to the union the military academy form the basis in regard to science on which the military establishment rest furnish annually after due examination and on the report of the academic staff many well inform youth to fill the vacancy which occur in the several corps of the army while other who retire to private life carry with such attainment as under the right reserve to the several state to appoint the officer and to train the militia will enable by afford a wide field for selection to promote the great object of the power vest in congress of provide for the organizing arming and discipline the militia thus by the mutual and harmonious cooperation of the government in the execution of a power divide between an object always to be cherish the attainment of a great result on which liberty may depend can not fail to be secure have to add that in proportion as regular force be small should the instruction and discipline of the militia the great resource on which rely be push to the utmost extent that circumstance will admit a report from the secretary of the navy will communicate the progress which have be make in the construction of vessel of war with other interesting detail respect the actual state of the affair of that department have be find necessary for the protection of commerce to maintain the usual squadron on the mediterranean the pacific and along the atlantic coast extend the cruise of the latter into the|west|indy where piracy organize into a system have prey on the commerce of every country trading thither a cruise have also be maintain on the coast of africa when the season would permit for the suppression of the slave trade and order have be give to the commander of all public ship to seize own vessel should find any engaging in that trade and to bring in for adjudication in the west|indy piracy be of recent date which may explain the cause why other power have not combine against by the document communicate will be see that the effort of the|united|state to suppress have have a very salutary effect the benevolent provision of the act under which the protection have be extend alike to the commerce of other nation can not fail to be duly appreciate by in compliance with the act of the last session entitle an act to abolish the|united|state trading establishment agent be immediately appoint and instruct under the direction of the secretary of the treasury to close the business of the trading house among the indian tribe and to settle the account of the factor and subfactor engage in that trade and to execute in all other respect the injunction of that act in the mode prescribe therein a final report of proceeding shall be communicate to congress as soon as be receive be with great regret have to state that a serious malady have deprive of many valuable citizen of pensacola and check the progress of some of those arrangement which be important to the territory this effect have be sensibly feel in respect to the indians who inhabit that territory consist of the remnant of the several tribe who occupy the middle ground between st.|augustine|and|pensacola with extensive claim but undefined boundary although peace be preserve with those indians yet position and claim tend essentially to interrupt the intercourse between the eastern and western part of the territory on which inhabitant be principally settle be essential to the growth and prosperity of the territory as well as to the interest of the union that those indians should be remove by special compact with to some other position or concentration within narrow limit where be with the limited mean in the power of the executive instruction be give to the governor to accomplish this object so far as may be practicable which be prevent by the distress malady refer to to carry fully into effect in either mode additional fund will be necessary to the provision of which the power of congress be competent with a view to such provision as may be deem proper the subject be submit to consideration and in the interim further proceeding be suspend appear that so much of the act entitle an act regulate the staff of the army which pass on as relate to the commissariat will expire in april next and the practical operation of that department have evince great utility the propriety of renewal be submit to consideration the view which have be take of the probable productiveness of the lead mine connect with the importance of the material to the public defense make expedient that should be manage with peculiar care be therefore suggest whether will not comport with the public interest to provide by law for the appointment of an agent skilled in mineralogy to superintend under the direction of the proper department be understand that the cumberland road which be construct at great expense have already suffer from the want of that regular superintendence and of those repair which be indispensable to the preservation of such a work this road be of incalculable advantage in facilitate the intercourse between the western and the atlantic state through the whole country from the northern extremity of lake|erie to the mississippi and from all the water which empty into each find and easy and direct communication to the seat of government and thence to the atlantic the facility which afford to all military and commercial operation and also to those of the|post|office|department can not be estimate too highly this great work be likewise an ornament and an honor to the nation believe that a competent power to adopt and execute a system of internal improvement have not be grant to congress but that such a power confine to great national purpose and with proper limitation would be productive of eminent advantage to union have think advisable that an amendment of the constitution to that effect should be recommend to the several state a bill which assume the right to adopt and execute such a system have be present for signature at the last session be compel from the view which have take of the power of the general government to negative on which occasion think proper to communicate the sentiment which have form on mature consideration on the whole subject to that communication in all the view in which the great interest to which relate may be suppose to merit attention have now to refer should congress however deem improper to recommend such an amendment have accord to judgment the right to keep the road in repair by provide for the superintendence of and appropriate the money necessary for repair surely if have the right to appropriate money to make the road have a right to appropriate to preserve the road from ruin from the exercise of this power no danger be to be apprehend under happy system the people be the sole and exclusive fountain of power each government originate from and to alone each to proper constituent be respectively and solely responsible for the faithful discharge of duty within constitutional limit and that the people will confine public agent of every station to the strict line of constitutional duty there be no cause of doubt have however communicate sentiment to congress at the last session fully in the document to which have refer respect the right of appropriation as distinct from the right of jurisdiction and sovereignty over the territory in question deem improper to enlarge on the subject here from the good information have be able to obtain appear that manufacture though depress immediately after the peace have considerably increase and be still increase under the encouragement give by the tariff of and by subsequent law satisfied be whatever may be the abstract doctrine in favor of unrestricted commerce provide all nation would concur in and be not liable to be interrupt by war which have never occur and can not be expect that there be other strong reason applicable to situation and relation with other country which impose on the obligation to cherish and sustain manufacture satisfied however likewise be that the interest of every part of union even of those most benefit by manufacture require that this subject should be touch with the great caution and a critical knowledge of the effect to be produce by the slight change on full consideration of the subject in all relation be persuade that a further augmentation may now be make of the duty on certain foreign article in favor of own and without affect injuriously any other interest for more precise detail refer to the communication which be make to congress during the last session so great be the amount of account for money advance during the late war in addition to other of a previous date which in the regular operation of the government necessarily remain unsettled that require a considerable length of time for adjustment by a report from the first comptroller|of|the|treasury appear that on the account then unsettle amount to 103,068,876.41 of which on have be settle leave on that|day a balance unsettled of that there have be draw from the treasury in pay the public debt and sustain the government in all operation and disbursement since 157,199,380.96 the account for which have be settle to the amount of 137,501,451.12 leave a balance unsettled of for precise detail respect each of these balance refer to the report of the comptroller and the document which accompany from this view appear that commercial difference with france and great|britain have be place in a train of amicable arrangement on condition fair and honorable in both instance to each party that finance be in a very productive state revenue be at present fully competent to all the demand upon that military force be well organized in all branch and capable of render the most important service in case of emergency that number will admit of that due progress have be make under exist appropriation in the construction of fortification and in the operation of the|ordnance|department that due progress have in like manner be make in the construction of ship of war that navy be in the good condition feel and respect in every sea in which be employ for the protection of commerce that manufacture have augment in amount and improve in quality that great progress have be make in the settlement of account and in the recovery of the balance due by individual and that the utmost economy be secure and observe in every department of the administration other object will likewise claim attention because from the station which the united|states hold as a member of the great community of nation have right to maintain duty to perform and danger to encounter a strong hope be entertain that peace would ere this have be conclude between spain and the independent government south of the|united|state in this hemisphere long experience have evince the competency of those government to maintain the independence which have declare be presume that the consideration which induce recognition by the|united|state would have have equal weight with other power and that spain yield to those magnanimous feeling of which history furnish so many example would have terminate on that basis a controversy so unavailing and at the same time so destructive still cherish the hope that this result will not long be postpone sustain neutral position and allow to each party while the war continue equal right be incumbent on the|united|state to claim of each with equal rigor the faithful observance of right accord to the well know law of nation from each therefore a like cooperation be expect in the suppression of the piratical practice which have grow out of this war and of blockade of extensive coast on both sea which consider the small force employ to sustain have not the slight foundation to rest on europe be still unsettled and although the war long menace between russia and turkey have not break out there be no certainty that the difference between those power will be amicably adjust be impossible to look to the oppression of the country respect which those difference arise without be deeply affected the mention of greece fill the mind with the most exalted sentiment and arouse in bosom the good feeling of which nature be susceptible superior skill and refinement in the art heroic gallantry in action disintereste patriotism enthusiastic zeal and devotion in favor of public and personal liberty be associate with recollection of ancient greece that such a country should have be overwhelm and so long hide as be from the world under a gloomy despotism have be a cause of unceasing and deep regret to generous mind for age past be natural therefore that the reappearance of those people in original character contend in favor of liberty should produce that great excitement and sympathy in favor which have be so signally display throughout the|united|state a strong hope be entertain that these people will recover independence and resume equal station among the nation of the earth a great effort have be make in spain and portugal to improve the condition of the people and must be very console to all benevolent mind to see the extraordinary moderation with which have be conduct that may promote the happiness of both nation be the ardent wish of this whole people to the expression of which confine for whatever may be the feeling or sentiment which every individual under government have a right to indulge and express be nevertheless a sacred maxim equally with the government and people that the destiny of every independent nation in what relate to such improvement of right belong and ought to be leave exclusively to whether reason from the late war or from those menacing symptom which now appear in europe be manifest that if a convulsion should take place in any of those country will proceed from cause which have no existence and be utterly unknown in these state in which there be but order that of the people to whom the sovereignty exclusively belong should war break out in any of those country who can foretell the extent to which may be carry or the desolation which may spread exempt as be from these cause internal tranquillity be secure and distant as be from the troubled scene and faithful to first principle in regard to other power may reasonably presume that should not be molest by this however ought not to be calculate on as certain unprovoked injury be often inflict and even the peculiar felicity of situation may with some be a cause for excitement and aggression the history of the late war in europe furnish a complete demonstration that no system of conduct however correct in principle can protect neutral power from injury from any party that a defenseless position and distinguished love of peace be the sure invitation to war and that there be no way to avoid other than by be always prepared and willing for just cause to meet if there be a people on earth whose more especial duty be to be at all time prepared to defend the right with which be bless and to surpass all other in sustain the necessary burthen and in submit to sacrifice to make such preparation be undoubtedly the people of these state when see that a civil war of the most frightful character rage from the adriatic to the|black|sea that strong symptom of war appear in other part proceed from cause which should break out may become general and be of long duration that the war still continue between spain and the independent government late province in this hemisphere that be likewise menace between portugal and brazil in consequence of the attempt of the latter to dismember from the former and that a system of piracy of great extent be maintain in the neighboring sea which will require equal vigilance and decision to suppress the reason for sustain the attitude which now hold and for push forward all measure of defense with the utmost vigor appear to to acquire new force the|united|state owe to the world a great example and by mean thereof to the cause of liberty and humanity a generous support have so far succeed to the satisfaction of the virtuous and enlighten of every country there be no reason to doubt that whole movement will be regulate by a sacred regard to principle all institution be found on that basis the ability to support own cause under any trial to which may be expose be the great point on which the public solicitude rest have be often charge against free government that have neither the foresight nor the virtue to provide at the proper season for great emergency that course be improvident and expensive that war will always find unprepared and whatever may be calamity that terrible warning will be disregard and forget as soon as peace return have full confidence that this charge so far as relate to the|united|state will be shew to be utterly destitute of truth transcript of the senate and of the|house|of|representatives the progress of affair since the last session have be such as may justly be claim and expect under a government derive all power from an enlightened people and under law form by representative on great consideration for the sole purpose of promote the welfare and happiness of constituent in the execution of those law and of the power vest by the constitution in the executive unremitted attention have be pay to the great object to which extend in the concern which be exclusively internal there be good cause to be satisfied with the result the law have have due operation and effect in those relate to foreign power be happy to state that peace and amity be preserve with all by a strict observance on both side of the right of each in matter touch commercial intercourse where a difference of opinion have exist as to the condition on which should be place each party have pursue own policy without give just cause of offense to the other in this annual communication especially when be address to a new congress the whole scope of political concern naturally come into view that error if such have be commit may be correct that defect which have become manifest may be remedie and on the other hand that measure which be adopt on due deliberation and which experience have shew be just in and essential to the public welfare should be persevere in and support in perform this necessary and very important duty shall endeavor to place before on merit every subject that be think to be entitle to particular attention in as distinct and clear a light as may be able by an act of so much of the several act as impose high duty on the tonnage of foreign vessel and on the manufacture and production of foreign nation when import into the|united|state in foreign vessel than when import in vessel of the|united|state be repeal so far as respect the manufacture and production of the nation to which such vessel belong on the condition that the repeal should take effect only in favor of any foreign nation when the executive should be satisfied that such discriminate duty to the disadvantage of the|united|state have likewise be repeal by such nation by this act a proposition be make to all nation to place commerce with each on a basis which be presume would be acceptable to all every nation be allow to bring manufacture and production into port and to take the manufacture and production of the|united|state back to port in own vessel on the same condition that may be transport in vessel of the|united|state and in return be require that a like accommodation should be grant to the vessel of the|united|state in the port of other power the article to be admit or prohibit on either side form no part of the propose arrangement each party would retain the right to admit or prohibit such article from the other as think proper and on own condition when the nature of the commerce between the|united|state and every other country be take into view be think that this proposition would be consider fair and even liberal by every power the export of the|united|state consist generally of article of the 1st necessity and of rude material in demand for foreign manufactory of great bulk require for transportation many vessel the return for which in the manufacture and production of any foreign country even when dispose of there to advantage may be bring in a single vessel this observation be the more especially applicable to those country from which manufacture alone be import but apply in great extent to the european dominion of every european power and in a certain extent to all the colony of those power by place then the navigation precisely on the same ground in the transportation of export and import between the|united|state and other country be presume that all be offer which could be desire seem to be the only proposition which could be devise which would retain even the semblance of equality in favor many consideration of great weight give a right to expect that this commerce should be extend to the colony as well as to the european dominion of other power with the latter especially with country exclusively manufacture the advantage be manifestly on side an indemnity for that loss be expect from a trade with the colony and with the great reason as be know that the supply which the colony derive from be of the high importance to labor be bestow with so much great profit in the culture of other article and because likewise the article of which those supply consist form so large a proportion of the export of the|united|state be never admit into any of the port of europe except in case of great emergency to avert a serious calamity when no article be admit which be not require to supply the want of the party admit and admit then not in favor of any particular country to the disadvantage of other but on condition equally applicable to all seem just that the article thus admit and invite should be carry thither in the vessel of the country afford such supply and that the reciprocity should be find in a corresponding accommodation on the other side by allow each party to participate in the transportation of such supply on the payment of equal tonnage a strong proof be afford of an accommodate spirit to abandon to the transportation of the whole would be a sacrifice which ought not to be expect the demand in the present instance would be the more unreasonable in consideration of the great inequality exist in the trade with the parent country such be the basis of system as establish by the act of and such true character in the|year in which this act be pass a treaty be conclude with great|britain in strict conformity with principle in regard to european dominion to colony however in the|west|indy and on this continent be not extend claim the exclusive supply of those colony and from own port and of the production of the colony in return in own vessel to this claim the|united|states could not assent and in consequence each party suspend the intercourse in the vessel of the other by a prohibition which still exist the same condition be offer to france but not accept government have demand other condition more favorable to navigation and which should also give extraordinary encouragement to manufacture and production in port of the|united|state to these be think improper to accede and in consequence the restrictive regulation which have be adopt on part be countervail on the part of the|united|state the direct commerce between the country in the vessel of each party have be in great measure suspend be much to be regret that although a negotiation have be long pende such be the diversity of view entertain on the various point which have be bring into discussion that there do not appear to be any reasonable prospect of early conclusion be duty to state as a cause of very great regret that very serious difference have occur in this negotiation respect the construction of the 8th article of the|treaty|of|1803 by which louisiana be cede to the|united|state and likewise respect the seizure of the apollo in for a violation of revenue law the claim of the government|of|france have excite not less surprise than concern because there do not appear to be a just foundation for in either instance by the 8th article of the treaty refer to be stipulate that after the expiration of during which time be provide by the 7th or precede article that the vessel of france and spain should be admit into the port of the ceded territory without pay high duty on merchandise or tonnage on the vessel than such as be pay by citizen of the|united|state the ship of france should forever afterwards be place on the footing of the most favor nation by the obvious construction of this article be presume that be intend that no favor should be grant to any power in those port to which france should not be forthwith entitle nor should any accommodation be allow to another power on condition to which would not also be entitle on the same condition under this construction no favor or accommodation could be grant to any power to the prejudice of france by allow the equivalent allow by those power would always stand in those port on the footing of the most favor nation but if this article should be so construe as that france should enjoy of right and without pay the equivalent all the advantage of such condition as may be allow to other power in return for important concession make by then the whole character of the stipulation would be change would not be place on the footing of the most favor nation but on a footing hold by no other nation would enjoy all advantage allow to in consideration of like advantage allow to free from every and any condition whatever as little cause have the government|of|france to complain of the seizure of the apollo and the removal of other vessel from the water of the|st.|marys will not be deny that every nation have a right to regulate commercial system as think fit and to enforce the collection of revenue provide be do without an invasion of the right of other power the violation of revenue law be an offense which all nation punish the punishment of which give no just cause of complaint to the power to which the offender belong provide be extend to all equally in this case every circumstance which occur indicate a fix purpose to violate revenue law have the party intend to have pursue a fair trade would have enter the port of some other power land good at the custom house accord to law and re - ship and send in the vessel of such power or of some other power which may lawfully bring free from such duty to a port of the|united|state but the conduct of the party in this case be altogether different enter the river st.|marys the boundary line between the|united|state and florida and take position on the spanish side on which in the whole extent of the river there be no town no port or custom house and scarcely any settlement purpose therefore be not to sell good to the inhabitant of florida but to citizen of the|united|state in exchange for production which could not be do without a direct and palpable breach of law be know that a regular systematic plan have be form by certain person for the violation of revenue system which make the more necessary to check the proceeding in commencement that the unsettled bank of a river so remote from the spanish garrison and population could give no protection to any party in such a practice be believe to be in strict accord with the law of nation would not have comport with a friendly policy in spain to have establish a custom house there since could have subserve no other purpose than to elude revenue law but the|government|of|spain do not adopt that measure on the contrary be understand that the captain general of cuba to whom an application to that effect be make by these adventurer have not accede to the condition of those provinces for many year before be cede to the|united|states need not now be dwell on inhabit by different tribe of indians and an inroad for every kind of adventurer the jurisdiction of spain may be say to have be almost exclusively confine to garrison certainly could not extend to place where have no authority the rule therefore applicable to settle country govern by law could not be deem so to the desert of florida and to the occurrence there merit attention also that the territory have be cede to the|united|state by a treaty the ratification of which have not be refuse and which have since be perform under any circumstance therefore spain become less responsible for such act commit there and the|united|stat more at liberty to exercise authority to prevent so great a mischief the conduct of this government have in every instance be conciliatory and friendly to france the construction of revenue law in application to the case which have form the ground of such serious complaint on part and the order to the collector of st.|marys in accord with be give two|year before these case occur and in reference to a breach which be attempt by the subject of another power the application therefore to the case in question be inevitable as soon as the treaty by which these province be cede to the|united|state be ratified and all danger of further breach of revenue law cease an order be give for the release of the vessel which have be seize and for the dismission of the libel which have be institute against the principle of this system of reciprocity found on the law of have be since carry into effect with the kingdoms of the netherlands sweden prussia and with hamburg lubeck and oldenburg with a provision make by subsequent law in regard to the netherlands prussia hamburg and bremen that such produce and manufacture as could only be or most usually be 1st ship from the port of those country the same be import in vessel wholly belong to subject should be consider and admit as own manufacture and production the government of norway have by an ordinance open the port of that part of the dominion of the king of sweden to the vessel of the|united|state upon the payment of no other or high duty than be pay by norwegian vessel from whatever place arrive and with whatever article laden have request the reciprocal allowance for the vessel of norway in the port of the|united|state as this privilege be not within the scope of the act of and can only be grant by congress and as may involve the commercial relation of the|united|state with other nation the subject be submit to the wisdom of congress have present thus fully to view commercial relation with other power that see in detail with each power and know the basis on which rest congress may in wisdom decide whether any change ought to be make and if any in what respect if this basis be unjust or unreasonable surely ought to be abandon but if be just and reasonable and any change in will make concession subversive of equality and tend in consequence to sap the foundation of prosperity then the reason be equally strong for adhere to the ground already take and support by such further regulation as may appear to be proper should any additional support be find necessary the question concern the construction of the first article of the treaty of ghent have be by a joint act of the representative of the|united|state and of great|britain at the|court|of|st.|petersburg submit to the decision of imperial majesty the emperor of russia the result of that submission have not yet be receive the commissioner under the 5th article of that treaty not have be able to agree upon decision report to the government accord to the provision of the treaty may be expect at an|early|day with spain the treaty of have be partly carry into execution possession of e and w fl have be give to the|united|state but the officer charge with that service by an order from his|catholic|majesty deliver by minister to the|sec|of|state and transmit by a special agent to the captain general of cuba to whom be direct and in whom the government of those provinces be vest have not only omit in contravention of the order of sovereign the performance of the express stipulation to deliver over the archive and document relate to the property and sovereignty of those provinces all of which be expect would have be deliver either before or when the troop be withdraw but defeat since every effort of the|united|state to obtain especially those of the great importance this omission have give rise to several incident of a painful nature the character of which will be fully disclose by the document which will be hereafter communicate in every other circumstance of the law of the|3rd|of|march|last for carry into effect that treaty have be duly attend to for the execution of that part which preserve in force for the government of the inhabitant for the term specify all the civil military and judicial power exercise by the exist government of those provinces an adequate # of officer as be presume be appoint and order to respective station both province be form into territory and a governor appoint for but in consideration of the pre - existing division and of the distance and difficulty of communication between pensacola the residence of the governor of west|florida and st.|augustine that of the governor of east|florida at which place the inconsiderable population of each province be principally collect secretary be appoint the one to reside at pensacola and the other at st.|augustine due attention be likewise pay to the execution of the law of the|united|state relate to the revenue and the slave trade which be extend to these provinces the whole territory be divide into collection district that part lie between the river st.|marys and cape|florida form that from the cape to the apalachicola another and that from the apalachicola to the perdido the third to these district the usual number of revenue officer be appoint and to secure the due operation of these law judge and a district attorney be appoint to reside at pensacola and likewise judge and a district attorney to reside at st.|augustine with a specify boundary between and marshal for the whole with authority to appoint a deputy in carry this law into effect and especially that part relate to the power of the exist government of those provinces be think important in consideration of the short term for which be to operate and the radical change which would be make at the approach session of congress to avoid expense to make no appointment which should not be absolutely necessary to give effect to those power to withdraw none of citizen from pursuit whereby to subject the government to claim which could not be gratify and the party to loss which would be painful to witness have be see with much concern that in the performance of these duty a collision arise between the governor of the territory and the judge appoint for the western district be presume that the law under which this transitory government be organize and the commission which be grant to the officer who be appoint to execute each branch of the system and to which the commission be adapt would have be understand in the same sense by in which be understand by the executive much allowance be due to officer employ in each branch of this system and the more so as there be good cause to believe that each act under the conviction that possess the power which undertake to exercise of the officer hold the principal station think proper to observe that accept with reluctance in compliance with the invitation give and from a high sense of duty to country be willing to contribute to the consummation of an event which would insure complete protection to an important part of union which have suffer much from incursion and invasion and to the defense of which very gallant and patriotic service have be so signally and usefully devoted from the intrinsic difficulty of execute law derive origin from different source and so essentially different in many important circumstance the advantage and indeed the necessity of establish as soon as practicable a well organize government over that territory on the principle of system be apparent this subject be therefore recommend to the early consideration of congress in compliance with an injunction of the law of the|3rd|of|march|last commissioner have also be appoint and a board organize for carry into effect the 11th article of the treaty above recite make provision for the payment of such of citizen as have well found claim on spain of the character specify by that treaty this board have enter on duty and make some progress therein the commissioner and surveyor of his|catholic|majesty provide for by the 4th article of the treaty have not yet arrive in the|united|state but be soon expect as soon as do arrive corresponding appointment will be make and every facility be afford for the due execution of this service the government of most faithful majesty since the termination of the last session of congress have be remove from rio|de|janeiro to lisbon where a revolution similar to that which have occur in the neighboring kingdom of spain have in like manner be sanction by the accept and pledge faith of the reign monarch the diplomatic intercourse between the|united|state and the portuguese dominion interrupt by this important event have not yet be resume but the change of internal administration have already materially affect the commercial intercourse of the|united|state with the portuguese dominion the renewal of the public mission between the country appear to be desirable at an|early|day be understand that the colony in south|america have have great success during the|present|year in the struggle for independence the new government|of|colombia have extend territory and considerably augment strength and at buenos|ayres where civil dissension have for some time before prevail great harmony and well order appear to have be establish equal success have attend effort in the|provinces|on|the|pacific have long be manifest that would be impossible for spain to reduce these colony by force and equally so that no condition short of independence would be satisfactory to may therefore be presume and be earnestly hope that the|government|of|spain guide by enlightened and liberal council will find to comport with interest and due to magnanimity to terminate this exhausting controversy on that basis to promote this result by friendly counsel with the|government|of|spain will be the object of in conduct the fiscal operation of the|year have be find necessary to carry into full effect the act of the last session of congress authorize a loan of this sum have be raise at an average premium of per centum upon stock bear an interest at the rate of % per annum redeemable at the option of the government after there have be issue under the provision of this act of % stock and there have be or will be redeem during the|year of louisiana % defer stock and mississippi stock there have therefore be an actual increase of the public debt contract during the|year of the receipt into the treasury from the|first|of|january|to|the|30th|of|september|last have amount to which with the balance of in the treasury on the|former|day make the aggregate sum of the payment from the treasury during the same period have amount to leave in the treasury on the last mention day the sum of be estimate that the receipt of the|4th|quarter|of|the|year will exceed the demand which will be make on the treasury during the same period and that the amount in the treasury on the|30th|of|september last will be increase on the|first|day|of|january|next at the close of the last session be anticipate that the progressive diminution of the public revenue in and which have be the result of the languid state of foreign commerce in those|years have in the|latter|year reach extreme point of depression have however be ascertain that that point be reach only at the termination of the|first|quarter|of|the|present|year from that time until the|30th|of|september last the duty secure have exceed those of the corresponding m whilst the amount of debenture issue during the|three|first|quarters|of|this|year be less than that of the same quarters|of|the|last|year there be just ground to believe that the improvement which have occur in the revenue during the last mention period will not only be maintain but that will progressively increase through the next and several succeed year so as to realize the result which be present upon that subject by the official report of the treasury at the commencement of the last session of congress under the influence of the most unfavorable circumstance the revenue for the next and subsequent year to the year will exceed the demand at present authorize by law may fairly be presume that under the protection give to domestic manufacture by the exist law shall become at no distant period a manufacture country on an extensive scale possess as do the raw material in such vast amount with a capacity to augment to an indefinite extent raise within the country aliment of every kind to an amount far exceed the demand for home consumption even in the most unfavorable year and to be obtain always at a very moderate price skilled also as people be in the mechanic art and in every improvement calculate to lessen the demand for and the price of labor be manifest that success in every branch of domestic industry may and will be carry under the encouragement give by the present duty to an extent to meet any demand which under a fair competition may be make upon a considerable increase of domestic manufacture by diminish the importation of foreign will probably tend to lessen the amount of the public revenue as however a large proportion of the revenue which be derive from duty be raise from other article than manufacture the demand for which will increase with population be believe that a fund will still be raise from that source adequate to the great part of the public expenditure especially as those expenditure should continue to be bless with peace will be diminish by the completion of the fortification dock yard and other public work by the augmentation of the navy to the point to which be propose to carry and by the payment of the public debt include pension for military service can not be doubt that the more complete internal resource and the less dependent be on foreign power for every national as well as domestic purpose the great and more stable will be the public felicity by the increase of domestic manufacture will the demand for the rude material at home be increase and thus will the dependence of the several part of union on each other and the strength of the union be proportionably augment in this process which be very desirable and inevitable under the exist duty the resource which obviously present to supply a deficiency in the revenue should occur be the interest which may derive the principal benefit from the change if domestic manufacture be raise by duty on foreign the deficiency in the fund necessary for public purpose should be supply by duty on the former at the last session seem doubtful whether the revenue derive from the present source would be adequate to all the great purpose of union include the construction of fortification the augmentation of the navy and the protection of commerce against the danger to which be expose have the deficiency be such as to subject to the necessity either to abandon those measure of defense or to resort to the other mean for adequate fund the course present to the adoption of a virtuous and enlightened people appear to be a plain one must be gratify to all to know that this necessity do not exist nothing however in contemplation of such important object which can be easily provide for should be leave to hazard be think that the revenue may receive an augmentation from the exist source and in a manner to aid manufacture without hasten prematurely the result which have be suggest be believe that a moderate additional duty on certain article would have that effect without be liable to any serious objection the examination of the whole coast for the construction of permanent fortification from st.|croix to the sabine with the exception of part of the territory lately acquire will be complete in the|present|year as will be the survey of the mississippi under the resolution of the|house|of|representatives from the mouth of the ohio to the ocean and likewise of the ohio from louisville to the mississippi a progress correspond with the sum appropriate have also be make in the construction of these fortification at the port designate as will form a system of defense for the whole maritime frontier and in consequence for the interior and be to last for age the great care have be take to fix the position of each work and to form on such a scale as will be adequate to the purpose intend by all the inlet and assailable part of union have be minutely examine and position take with a view to the good effect observe in every instance a just regard for economy doubt however be entertain as to the propriety of the position and extent of the work at further progress in be suspend soon after the last session of congress and an order give to the|board|of|engineers|and|naval|commissioner to make a further and more minute examination of in both respect and to report the result without delay due progress have be make in the construction of vessel of war accord to the law provide for the gradual augmentation of the navy and to the extent of exist appropriation the vessel authorize by the act of have all be complete and be now in actual service none of the large ship have be or will be launch for the present the object be to protect all which may not be require for immediate service from decay by suitable building erect over a squadron have be maintain as heretofore in the mediterranean by mean whereof peace have be preserve with the|barbary|power this squadron have be reduce the|present|year to as small a force as be compatible with the fulfillment of the object intend by from past experience and the good information respect the view of those power be distinctly understand that should squadron be withdraw would soon recommence hostility and depredation upon commerce fortification have lately be rebuild and maritime force increase have also be find necessary to maintain a naval force on the pacific for the protection of the very important interest of citizen engage in commerce and the fishery in that sea vessel have likewise be employ in cruising along the atlantic coast in the|gulf|of|mexico on the coast of africa and in the neighboring sea in the latter many piracy have be commit on commerce and so extensive be become the range of those unprincipled adventurer that there be cause to apprehend without a timely and decisive effort to suppress the bad consequence would ensue fortunately a considerable check have be give to that spirit by cruiser who have succeed in capture and destroy several of vessel nevertheless be consider an object of high importance to continue these cruise until the practice be entirely suppress like success have attend effort to suppress the slave trade under the flag of the|united|state and the sanction of paper the trade may be consider as entire suppress and if any of citizen be engage in under the flag and paper of other power be only from a respect of those power that these offender be not seize and bring home to receive the punishment which the law inflict if every other power should adopt the same policy and pursue the same vigorous mean for carry into effect the trade could no longer exist deeply impressed with the blessing which enjoy and of

which be found by the people who possess exclusively the sovereignty seem proper that the person who may be place by suffrage in this high trust should declare on commence duty the principle on which intend to conduct the administration if the person thus elect have serve the precede term an opportunity be afford to review principal occurrence and to give such further explanation respect as in judgment may be useful to constituent the event of one|year have influence on those of another and in like manner of a preceding on the succeed administration the movement of a great nation be connect in all part if error have be commit ought to be correct if the policy be sound ought to be support be by a thorough knowledge of the whole subject that fellow citizen be enable to judge correctly of the past and to give a proper direction to the future just before the commencement of the last term the|united|state have conclude a war with a very powerful nation on condition equal and honorable to both party the event of that war be too recent and too deeply impressed on the memory of all to require a development from commerce have be in a great measure drive from the sea atlantic and inland frontier be invade in almost every part the waste of life along coast and on some part of inland frontier to the defense of which gallant and patriotic citizen be call be immense in addition to which not be add at end to the public debt as soon as the war have terminate the nation admonish by event resolve to place in a situation which should be better calculated to prevent the recurrence of a like evil and in case should recur to mitigate calamity with this view after reduce land force to the basis of a peace establishment which have be further modify since provision be make for the construction of fortification at proper point through the whole extent of coast and such an augmentation of naval force as should be well adapt to both purpose the law make this provision be pass in and and have be since the constant effort of the executive to carry into effect the advantage of these fortification and of an augmented naval force in the extent contemplate in a point of economy have be fully illustrate by a report of the|board|of|engineers|and|naval|commissioner lately communicate to congress by which appear that in an invasion by man with a correspondent naval force in a campaign of six|month only the whole expense of the construction of the work would be defray by the difference in the sum necessary to maintain the force which would be adequate to defense with the aid of those work and that which would be incur without the reason of this difference be obvious if fortification be judiciously place on great inlet as distant from city as circumstance will permit will form the only point of attack and the enemy will be detain there by a small regular force a sufficient time to enable militia to collect and repair to that on which the attack be make a force adequate to the enemy collect at that single point with suitable preparation for such other as may be menace be all that would be requisite but if there be no fortification then the enemy may go where please and change position and sailing from place to place force must be call out and spread in vast number along the whole coast and on both side of every bay and river as high up in each as may be navigable for ship of war by these fortification support by navy to which would afford like support should present to other power an armed front from st.|croix to the sabine which would protect in the event of war whole coast and interior from invasion and even in the war of other power in which be neutral would be find eminently useful as by keep public ship at a distance from city peace and order in would be preserve and the government be protect from insult nee scarcely be remark that these measure have not be resort to in a spirit of hostility to other power such a disposition do not exist toward any power peace and good will have be and will hereafter be cultivate with all and by the most faithful regard to justice have be dictate by a love of peace of economy and an earnest desire to save the life of fellow citizen from that destruction and country from that devastation which be inseparable from war when find unprepared for be believe and experience have show that such a preparation be the good expedient that can be resort to prevent war add with much pleasure that considerable progress have already be make in these measure of defense and that will be complete in a|few|year consider the great extent and importance of the object if the plan be zealously and steadily persevere in the conduct of the government in what relate to foreign power be always an object of the high importance to the nation agriculture commerce manufacture fishery revenue in short peace may all be affect by attention be therefore due to this subject at the period advert to the power of europe after have be engage in long and destructive war with each other have conclude a peace which happily still exist peace with the power with whom have be engage have also be conclude the war between spain and the colony in south|america which have commence many year before be then the only conflict that remain unsettled this be a contest between different part of the same community in which other power have not interfere be not affect by accommodation this contest be consider at an early stage by predecessor a civil war in which the party be entitle to equal right in port this decision the first make by any power be form on great consideration of the comparative strength and resource of the party the length of time and successful opposition make by the colony and of all other circumstance on which ought to depend be in strict accord with the law of nation congress have invariably act on this principle have make no change in relation with either party attitude have therefore be that of neutrality between which have be maintain by the government with the strict impartiality no aid have be afford to either nor have any privilege be enjoy by the one which have not be equally open to the other party and every exertion have be make in power to enforce the execution of the law prohibit illegal equipment with equal rigor against both by this equality between the party public vessel have be receive in port on the same footing have enjoy an equal right to purchase and export arm munition of war and every other supply the exportation of all article whatever be permit under law which be pass long before the commencement of the contest citizen have trade equally with both and commerce with each have be alike protect by the government respect the attitude which may be proper for the|united|state to maintain hereafter between the party have no hesitation in state as opinion that the neutrality heretofore observe should still be adhere to from the change in the|government|of|spain and the negotiation now depend invite by the cortes and accept by the colony may be presume that difference will be settle on the term propose by the colony should the war be continue the|united|state regard occurrence will always have in power to adopt such measure respect as honor and interest may require shortly after the general peace a band of adventurer take advantage of this conflict and of the facility which afford to establish a system of buccaneering in the neighboring sea to the great annoyance of the commerce of the|united|state and as be represent of that of other power of this spirit and of injurious bearing on strong proof be afford by the establishment at amelia|island and the purpose to which be make instrumental by this band in and by the occurrence which take place in other part of florida in the detail of which in both instance be too well known to require to be now recite be satisfied have a less decisive course be adopt that the bad consequence would have result from have see that these check decisive as be be not sufficient to crush that piratical spirit many culprit bring within limit have be condemn to suffer death the punishment due to that atrocious crime the decision of upright and enlighten tribunal fall equally on all whose crime subject by a fair interpretation of the law to censure belong to the executive not to suffer the execution under these decision to transcend the great purpose for which punishment be necessary the full benefit of example be secure policy as well as humanity equally forbid that should be carry further have act on this principle pardon those who appear to have be lead astray by ignorance of the criminality of the act have commit and suffer the law to take effect on those only in whose favor no extenuate circumstance could be urge great confidence be entertain that the late treaty with spain which have be ratify by both the party and the ratification whereof have be exchange have place the relation of the country on a basis of permanent friendship the provision make by for such of citizen as have claim on spain of the character describe will be presume be very satisfactory to and the boundary which be establish between the territory of the party westward of the mississippi heretofore in dispute have be think be settle on condition just and advantageous to both but to the acquisition of florida too much importance can not be attach secure to the|united|state a territory important in and whose importance be much increase by bearing on many of the high interest of the union open to several of the neighboring states a free passage to the ocean through the province cede by several river have source high up within limit secure against all future annoyance from powerful indian tribe give several excellent harbor in for ship of war of the large size cover by position in the|gulf|the|mississippi|and|other|great water within extended limit and thereby enable the|united|state to afford complete protection to the vast and very valuable production of whole western country which find a market through those stream by a treaty with bear date on the|20th|of|october,|1818 the convention regulate the commerce between the|united|state and great|britain conclude on the of july,|1815 which be about expire be revive and continue for the term of ten|year from the time of expiration by that treaty also the difference which have arise under the treaty of ghent respect the right claim by the|united|state for citizen to take and cure fish on the coast of his|britannic|majesty 's dominion in america with other difference on important interest be adjust to the satisfaction of both party no agreement have yet be enter into respect the commerce between the|united|state and the british dominion in the|west|indy and on this continent the restraint impose on that commerce by great|britain and reciprocate by the|united|state on a principle of defense continue still in force the negotiation with france for the regulation of the commercial relation between the country which in the course of the|last|summer have be commence at paris have since be transfer to this city and will be pursue on the part of the|united|state in the spirit of conciliation and with an earnest desire that may terminate in an arrangement satisfactory to both party relation with the|barbary|power be preserve in the same state and by the same mean that be employ when come into this office as early as be find necessary to send a squadron into the mediterranean for the protection of commerce and no period have intervene a short term except when be think advisable to withdraw the great interest which the|united|state have in the pacific in commerce and in the fishery have also make necessary to maintain a naval force there in disposing of this force in both instance the most effectual measure in power have be take without interfere with other duty for the suppression of the slave trade and of piracy in the neighboring sea the situation of the|united|state in regard to resource the extent of revenue and the facility with which be raise afford a most gratifying spectacle the payment of of the public debt with the great progress make in measure of defense and in other improvement of various kind since the late war be conclusive proof of this extraordinary prosperity especially when be recollect that these expenditure have be defray without a burthen on the people the direct tax and excise have be repeal soon after the conclusion of the late war and the revenue apply to these great object have be raise in a manner not to be feel great resource therefore remain untouched for any purpose which may affect the vital interest of the nation for all such purpose be inexhaustible be more especially to be find in the virtue patriotism and intelligence of fellow citizen and in the devotion with which would yield up by any just measure of taxation all property in support of the right and honor of country under the present depression of price affect all the production of the country and every branch of industry proceed from cause explain on a former occasion the revenue have considerably diminish the effect of which have be to compel congress either to abandon these great measure of defense or to resort to loan or internal taxis to supply the deficiency on the presumption that this depression and the deficiency in the revenue arise from would be temporary loan be authorize for the demand of the last and present year anxious to relieve fellow citizen in from every burthen which could be dispense with and the state of the treasury permit recommend the repeal of the internal taxis know that such relief be then peculiarly necessary in consequence of the great exertion make in the late war make that recommendation under a pledge that should the public exigency require a recurrence to at any time while remain in this trust would with equal promptitude perform the duty which would then be alike incumbent on by the experiment now make will be see by the next session of congress whether the revenue shall have be so augmented as to be adequate to all these necessary purpose should the deficiency still continue and especially should be probable that would be permanent the course to be pursue appear to to be obvious be satisfied that under certain circumstance loan may be resort to with great advantage be equally well satisfied as a general rule that the demand of the|current|year especially in time of peace should be provide for by the revenue of that|year have never dread nor have ever shun in any situation in which have be place make appeal to the virtue and patriotism of fellow citizen well know that could never be make in vain especially in time of great emergency or for purpose of high national importance independently of the exigency of the case many consideration of great weight urge a policy have in view a provision of revenue to meet to a certain extent the demand of the nation without rely altogether on the precarious resource of foreign commerce be satisfied that internal duty and excise with correspond impost on foreign article of the same kind would without impose any serious burden on the people enhance the price of produce promote manufacture and augment the revenue at the same time that make more secure and permanent the care of the indian tribe within limit have long be an essential part of system but unfortunately have not be execute in a manner to accomplish all the object intend by have treat as independent nation without have any substantial pretension to that rank the distinction have flatter pride retard improvement and in many instance pave the way to destruction the progress of settlement westward support as be by a dense population have constantly drive back with almost the total sacrifice of the land which have be compel to abandon have claim on the magnanimity and may add on the justice of this nation which must all feel should become real benefactor should perform the office of great father the endear title which emphatically give to the chief magistrate of union sovereignty over vast territory should cease in lieu of which the right of soil should be secure to each individual and posterity in competent portion and for the territory thus cede by each tribe some reasonable equivalent should be grant to be vest in permanent fund for the support of civil government over and for the education of child for instruction in the art of husbandry and to provide sustenance for until could provide for earnest hope be that congress will digest some plan found on these principle with such improvement as wisdom may suggest and carry into effect as soon as may be practicable europe be again unsettled and the prospect of war increase should the flame light up in any|quarter how far may extend be impossible to foresee be peculiar felicity to be altogether unconnected with the cause which produce this menacing aspect elsewhere with every power be in perfect amity and be interest to remain so if be practicable on just condition see no reasonable cause to apprehend variance with any power unless proceed from a violation of maritime right in these contest should occur and to

as be manage by argument and by a fair appeal to the good sense of the people and many of the defect which experience have clearly demonstrate in both government have be remedie by steadily pursue this course in this spirit there be every reason to believe that system will soon attain the high degree of perfection of which human institution be capable and that the movement in all branch will

the|government|of|spain and that the cortes have the subject under consideration the result of the deliberation of that body which be daily expect will be make known to congress as soon as be receive the friendly sentiment which be express on the part of the|united|state in the message of the 9th of may last be still entertain for spain among the cause of regret however which be inseparable from the delay attend this transaction be proper to state that satisfactory information have be receive that measure have be recently adopt by design person to convert certain part of into depot for the reception of foreign good from whence to smuggle into the|united|state by open a port within the limit of florida immediately on boundary where there be no settlement the object could not be misunderstood an early accommodation of difference will be hope prevent all such fraudulent and pernicious practice and place the relation of the country on a very amicable and permanent basis the commercial relation between the|united|state and the british colony in the|west|indy and on this continent have undergo no change still prefer to leave that commerce under the restriction heretofore impose on on each side be satisfactory to recollect that the restraint resort to by the|united|state be defensive only intend to prevent a monopoly under british regulation in favor of great|britain as likewise be to know that the experiment be advance in a spirit of amity between the party the question depend between the|united|state and great|britain respect the construction of the first article of the treaty of ghent have be refer by both government to the decision of the emperor of russia who have accept the umpirage an attempt have be make with the government|of|france to regulate

be give learn that the negotiation have be commence there but serious difficulty have occur the|french|government have resolve to transfer to the|united|state for which purpose the minister plenipotentiary of france have be order to repair to this city and whose arrival may soon be expect be hope that this important interest may be arrange on just condition and in a manner equally satisfactory to both party be submit to congress to decide until such arrangement be make how far may be proper on the principle of the act of the last session which augment the tonnage duty on french vessel to adopt other measure for carry more completely into effect the policy of that act the act refer to which impose new tonnage on french vessel have be in force from and after the|first|day|of|july have happen that several vessel of that nation which have be dispatch from france before existence be know have enter the port of the|united|state and be subject to operation without that previous notice which the general spirit of law give to individual in similar case the object of that law have be merely to countervail the inequality which exist to the disadvantage of the|united|state in commercial intercourse with france be submit also to the consideration of congress whether in the spirit of amity and conciliation which be no less the inclination than the policy of the|united|state to preserve in intercourse with other power may not be proper to extend relief to the individual interested in those case by exempt from the operation of the law all those vessel which have enter port without have have the mean of previously know the existence of the additional duty the contest between spain and the colony accord to the most authentic information be maintain by the latter with improved success the unfortunate division which be know to exist some time since at buenos|ayres be understand still prevail in no part of south|america have spain make any impression on the colony while in many part and particularly in venezuela and new|grenada the colony have gain strength and acquire reputation both for the management of the war in which have be successful and for the order of the internal administration the late change in the|government|of|spain by the reestablishment of the constitution of be an event which promise to be favorable to the revolution under the authority of the cortes the congress of angostura be invite to open a negotiation for the settlement of difference between the party to which be reply that would willingly open the negotiation provide the acknowledgment of independence be make basis but not otherwise no fact be know to this government to warrant the belief that any of the power of europe will take part in the contest whence may be infer consider all circumstance which must have weight in produce the result that an adjustment will finally take place on the basis propose by the colony to promote that result by friendly counsel with other power include spain have be the uniform policy of this government in look to the internal concern of country will be persuade derive much satisfaction from a view of the several object to which in the discharge of official duty attention will be draw among these none hold a more important place than the public revenue from the direct operation of the power by which be raise on the people and by influence in give effect to every other power of the government the revenue depend on the resource of the country and the facility by which the amount require be raise be a strong proof of the extent of the resource and of the efficiency of the government a few prominent fact will place this great interest in a just light before on the funded and float debt of the|united|state be estimate at if to this sum be add the amount of % stock subscribe to the|bank|of|the|united|states the amount of mississippi stock and of the stock which be issue subsequently to that date and as afterwards liquidate to on amount to have be reduce in that interval by payment during this term the expense of the|government|of|the|united|state be likewise defray in every branch of the civil military and naval establishment the public edifice in this city have be rebuild with considerable addition extensive fortification have be commence and be in a train of execution permanent arsenal and magazine have be erect in various part of the union navy have be considerably augment and the ordnance munition of war and store of the army and navy which be much exhausted during the war have be replenish by the discharge of so large a proportion of the public debt and the execution of such extensive and important operation in so short a time a just estimate may be form of the great extent of national resource the demonstration be the more complete and gratify when be recollect that the direct tax and excise be repeal soon after the termination of the late war and that the revenue apply to these purpose have be derive almost wholly from other source the receipt into the treasury from every source to the|30th|of|september|last have amount to whilst the public expenditure to the same period amount to leave in the treasury on that|day a sum estimate at for the probable receipt of the|following|year refer to the statement which will be transmit from the treasury the sum of m authorize to be raise by loan by an act of the last session of congress have be obtain upon term advantageous to the government indicate not only an increase confidence in the faith of the nation but the existence of a large amount of capital seek that mode of investment at a rate of interest not exceed % per annum be proper to add that there be now due to the treasury for the sale of public land in bring this subject to view consider duty to submit to congress whether may not be advisable to extend to the purchaser of these land in consideration of the unfavorable change which have occur since the sale a reasonable indulgence be know that the purchase be make when the price of every article have rise to great height and the installment be become due at a period of great depression be presume that some plan may be devise by the wisdom of congress compatible with the public interest which would afford great relief to these purchaser considerable progress have be make during the|present|season in examine the coast and various bay and other inlet in the collection of material and in the construction of fortification for the defense of the union at several of the position at which have be decide to erect such work at mobile|point and dauphin|island and at the rigolets lead to lake|pontchartrain material to a considerable amount have be collect and all the necessary preparation make for the commencement of the work at old|point|comfort at the mouth of the|james|river and at the|rip rap on the opposite shore in the|chesapeake|bay material to a vast amount have be collect and at the old point some progress have be make in the construction of the fortification which be on a very extensive scale the work at fort|washington on this river will be complete early in the|next|spring and that on the pea patch in the delaware in the course of the|next|season fort|diamond at the narrows in the harbor of ny will be finish this|year the work at boston ny baltimore norfolk charleston and niagara have be in part repair and the coast of nc extend south to cape|fear have be examine as have likewise other part of the coast eastward of boston great exertion have be make to push forward these work with the utmost dispatch possible but when extent be consider with the important purpose for which be intend the defense of the whole coast and in consequence of the whole interior and that be to last for age will be manifest that a well- digested plan found on military principle connect the whole together combine security with economy could not be prepare without repeat examination of the most exposed and difficult part and that would also take considerable time to collect the material at the several point where would be require from all the light that have be shed on this subject be satisfied that every favorable anticipation which have be form of this great undertaking will be verify and that when complete will afford very great if not complete protection to atlantic frontier in the event of another war protection sufficient to counterbalance in a single campaign with an enemy powerful at sea the expense of all these work without take into the estimate the saving of the life of so many of citizen the protection of town and other property or the tendency of such work to prevent war military position have be maintain at belle|point on the arkansas at council|bluff on the missouri at st.|peters on the mississippi and at green|bay on the upper lakes commodious barrack have already be erect at most of these post with such work as be necessary for defense progress have also be make in open communication between and in raise supply at each for the support of the troop by own labor particularly those most remote with the indians peace have be preserve and a progress make in carry into effect the act of congress make an appropriation for civilization with the prospect of favorable result as connect equally with both these object trade with those tribe be think to merit the attention of congress in original state game be sustenance and war occupation and if find no employment from civilized power destroy each other leave to extirpation be inevitable by a judicious regulation of trade with supply want administer to comfort and gradually as the game retire draw to by maintain post far in the interior acquire a more thorough and direct control over without which be confidently believe that a complete change in manner can never be accomplish by such post aid by a proper regulation of trade with and a judicious civil administration over to be provide for by law shall be presume be enable not only to protect own settlement from savage incursion and preserve peace among the several tribe but accomplish also the great purpose of civilization considerable progress have also be make in the construction of ship of war some of which have be launch in the course of the|present|year peace with the power on the coast of barbary have be preserve but owe altogether to the presence of squadron in the mediterranean have be find equally necessary to employ some of vessel for the protection of commerce in the|indian|sea the pacific and along the atlantic coast the interest which have depend in those|quarters which have be much improve of late be of great extent and of high importance to the nation as well as to the party concern and would undoubtedly suffer if such protection be not extend to in execution of the law of the last session for the suppression of the slave trade some of public ship have also be employ on the coast of africa where several capture have already be make of vessel engage in that disgraceful traffic transcript of the senate and of the|house|of|representatives the public building be advance to a stage to afford accommodation for congress offer sincere congratulation on the recommencement of duty in the capitol in bring to view the incident most deserving attention which have occur since last session regret to have to state that several of principal city have suffer by sickness that an unusual drought have prevail in the|middle|and|western|state and that a derangement have be feel in some of moneyed institution which have proportionably affect credit be happy however to have in power to assure that the health of city be now completely restore that the produce of the|year though less abundant than usual will not only be amply sufficient for home consumption but afford a large surplus for the supply of the want of other nation and that the derangement in the circulate paper medium by be leave to those remedy which obvious cause suggest and the good sense and virtue of fellow citizen supply have diminish have inform congress on the|27th|of|february last that a treaty of amity settlement and limit have be conclude in this city between the|united|state and spain and ratify by the competent authority of the former full confidence be entertain that would have be ratify by his|catholic|majesty with equal promptitude and a like earnest desire to terminate on the condition of that treaty the difference which have so long exist between the country every view which the subject admit of be think to have justify this conclusion great loss have be sustain by citizen of the|united|state from spanish cruiser more|than|20|years|before which have not be redress these loss have be acknowledge and provide for by a treaty as far back as the|year|1802 which although conclude at madrid be not then ratify by the|government|of|spain nor since until the|last|year when be suspend by the late treaty a more satisfactory provision to both party as be presume have be make for other difference have arise in this long interval affect high interest which be likewise provide for by this last treaty the treaty be form on great consideration and a thorough knowledge of all circumstance the subject matter of every article have be for year under discussion and repeat reference have be make by the minister of spain to government on the point respect which the great difference of opinion prevail be form by a minister duly authorize for the purpose who have represent government in the|united|state and be employ in this long- protract negotiation several|year and who be not deny keep strictly within the letter of instruction the faith of spain be therefore pledge under circumstance of peculiar force and solemnity for ratification on the part of the|united|state this treaty be evidently accede to in a spirit of conciliation and concession the indemnity for injury and loss so long before sustain and now again acknowledge and provide for be to be pay by without become a charge on the treasury of spain for territory cede by spain other territory of great value to which claim be believe to be well found be cede by the|united|state and in a|quarter more interesting to this cession be nevertheless receive as the mean of indemnify citizen in a considerable sum the presume amount of loss other consideration of great weight urge the cession of this territory by spain be surround by the|territories|of|the|united|state on every side except on that of the ocean spain have lose authority over and fall into the hand of adventurer connect with the savage be make the mean of uncease annoyance and injury to union in many of most essential interest by this cession then spain cede a territory in reality of no value to and obtain concession of the high importance by the settlement of long- standing difference with the|united|state affect respective claim and limit and likewise relieve from the obligation of a treaty relate to which have fail to fulfill and also from the responsibility incident to the most flagrant and pernicious abuse of right where could not support authority be know that the treaty be form under these circumstance not a doubt be entertain that his|catholic|majesty would have ratify without delay regret to have to state that this reasonable expectation have be disappoint that the treaty be not ratified within the time stipulate and have not since be ratify as be important that the nature and character of this unexpected occurrence should be distinctly understand think duty to communicate to all the fact and circumstance in possession relate to anxious to prevent all future disagreement with spain by give the most prompt effect to the treaty which have be thus conclude and particularly by the establishment of a government in florida which should preserve order there the minister of the|united|state who have be recently appoint to his|catholic|majesty and to whom the ratification by government have be commit to be exchange for that of spain be instruct to transmit the latter to the|department|of|state as soon as obtain by a public ship subject to order for the purpose unexpected delay occur in the ratification by spain request to be inform of the cause be state in reply that the great importance of the subject and a desire to obtain explanation on certain point which be not specify have produce the delay and that an envoy would be dispatch to the|united|state to obtain such explanation of this government the minister of the|united|state offer to give full explanation on any point on which may be desire which proposal be decline have communicate this result to the|department|of|state in august last be instruct notwithstanding the disappointment and surprise which produce to inform the government|of|spain that if the treaty should be ratified and transmit here at any time before the meeting of congress would be receive and have the same effect as if have be ratify in due time this order be execute the authorize communication be make to the|government|of|spain and by answer which have just be receive be officially make acquaint for the first time with the cause which have prevent the ratification of the treaty by his|catholic|majesty be allege by the minister of spain that government have attempt to alter of the principal article of the treaty by a declaration which the minister of the|united|state have be order to present when should deliver the ratification by government in exchange for that of spain and of which give notice explanatory of the sense in which that article be understand be further allege that this government have recently tolerate or protect an expedition from the|united|state against the|province|of|texas these imputed act be state as the reason which have induce catholic majesty to withhold ratification from the treaty to obtain explanation respect which be repeat that an envoy would be forthwith dispatch to the|united|state how far these allegation will justify the conduct of the|government|of|spain will appear on a view of the follow fact and the evidence which support will be see by the document transmit herewith that the declaration mention relate to a clause in the 8th article concern certain grant of land recently make by his|catholic|majesty in florida which be understand have convey all the land which until then have be ungrante be the intention of the party to annul these latter grant and that clause be draw for that express purpose and for none other the date of these grant be unknown but be understand to be posterior to that insert in the article indeed must be obvious to all that if that provision in the treaty have not the effect of annul these grant would be altogether nugatory immediately after the treaty be conclude and ratify by this government an intimation be receive that these grant be of anterior date to that fix on by the treaty and that would not of course be affect by the mere possibility of such a case so inconsistent with the intention of the party and the meaning of the article induce this government to demand an explanation on the subject which be immediately grant and which correspond with this statement wrt the other act allege that this government have tolerate or protect an expedition against texas be utterly without foundation every discountenance have invariably be give to any such attempt within the limit of the|united|state as be fully evince by the act of the government and the proceeding of the court there be cause however to apprehend in the course of the|last|summer that some adventurer entertain view of the kind suggest the attention of the constitute authority in that|quarter be immediately draw to and be know that the project whatever may be have utterly fail these fact will be presume satisfy every impartial mind that the|government|of|spain have no justifiable cause for decline to ratify the treaty a treaty conclude in conformity with instruction be obligatory in good faith in all stipulation accord to the true intent and meaning of the party each party be bind to ratify if either could set aside without the consent of the other there would be no longer any rule applicable to such transaction between nation by this proceeding the|government|of|spain have render to the|united|state a new and very serious injury have be state that a minister would be send to ask certain explanation of this government but if such be desire why be not ask within the time limit for the ratification be contemplate to open a new negotiation respect any of the article or condition of the treaty if that be do to what consequence may not lead at what time and in what manner would a new negotiation terminate by this proceed spain have form a relation between the country which will justify any measure on the part of the|united|state which a strong sense of injury and a proper regard for the right and interest of the nation may dictate in the course to be pursue these object should be constantly hold in view and have due weight national honor must be maintain and a new and a distinguished proof be afford of that regard for justice and moderation which have invariably govern the council of this free people must be obvious to all that if the|united|states have be desirous of make conquest or have be even willing to aggrandize in that way could have have no inducement to form this treaty would have much cause for gratulation at the course which have be pursue by spain an ample field for ambition be open before but such a career be not consistent with the principle of government nor the interest of the nation from a full view of all circumstance be submit to the consideration of congress whether will not be proper for the|united|state to carry the condition of the treaty into effect in the same manner as if have be ratify by spain claim on part all advantage and yield to spain those secure to by pursue this course shall rest on the sacred ground of right sanction in the most solemn manner by spain by a treaty which be bind to ratify for refuse to do which must incur the censure of other nation even those most friendly to while by confine within that limit can not fail to obtain well merit approbation must have peace on a frontier where have be so long disturb citizen must be indemnify for loss so long since sustain and for which indemnity have be so unjustly withhold from accomplish these great object obtain all that be desirable but his|catholic|majesty have twice declare determination to send a minister to the|united|state to ask explanation on certain point and to give respect delay to ratify the treaty shall act by take the cede territory and proceed to execute the other condition of the treaty before this minister arrive and be hear this be a case which form a strong appeal to the candor the magnanimity and the honor of this people much be due to courtesy between nation by a short delay shall lose nothing for rest on the ground of immutable truth and justice can not be divert from purpose ought to be presume that the explanation which may be give to the minister of spain will be satisfactory and produce the desire result in any event the delay for the purpose mention be a further manifestation of the sincere desire to terminate in the most friendly manner all difference with spain can not fail to be duly appreciate by his|catholic|majesty as well as by other power be submit therefore whether will not be proper to make the law propose for carry the condition of the treaty into effect should be adopt contingent to suspend operation upon the responsibility of the executive in such manner as to afford an opportunity for such friendly explanation as may be desire during the present session of congress communicate to congress a copy of the treaty and of the instruction to the minister of the|united|state at madrid respect of correspondence with the minister of spain and of such other document as may be necessary to give a full view of the subject in the course which the|spanish|government have on this occasion think proper to pursue be satisfactory to know that have not be countenance by any other european power on the contrary the opinion and wish both of france and great|britain have not be withhold either from the|united|state or from spain and have be unequivocal in favor of the ratification there be also reason to believe that the sentiment of of russia have be the same and that have also be make known to the cabinet of madrid in the civil war exist between spain and the spanish provinces in this hemisphere the great care have be take to enforce the law intend to preserve an impartial neutrality port have continue to be equally open to both party and on the same condition and citizen have be equally restrain from interfere in favor of either to the prejudice of the other the progress of the war however have operate manifestly in favor of the colony buenos|ayre still maintain unshaken the independence which declare in and have enjoy since like success have also lately attend chili and the provinces north of the la|plata border on and likewise venezuela this contest have from commencement be very interesting to other power and to none more so than to the|united|state a virtuous people may and will confine within the limit of a strict neutrality but be not in power to behold a conflict so vitally important to neighbor without the sensibility and sympathy which naturally belong to such a case have be the steady purpose of this government to prevent that feeling lead to excess and be very gratifying to have in power to state that so strong have be the sense throughout the whole community of what be due to the character and obligation of the nation that very few example of a contrary kind have occur the distance of the colony from the parent country and the great extent of population and resource give advantage which be anticipate at a very early period would be difficult for spain to surmount the steadiness consistency and success with which have pursue object as evince more particularly by the undisturbed sovereignty which buenos|ayres have so long enjoy evidently give a strong claim to the favorable consideration of other nation these sentiment on the part of the|united|state have not be withhold from other power with whom be desirable to act in concert should become manifest to the world that the effort of spain to subdue these province will be fruitless may be presume that the|spanish|government will give up the contest in produce such a determination can not be doubt that the opinion of friendly power who have take no part in the controversy will have merit influence be of the high importance to national character and indispensable to the morality of citizen that all violation of neutrality should be prevent no door should be leave open for the evasion of law no opportunity afford to any who may be dispose to take advantage of to compromit the interest or the honor of the nation be submit therefore to the consideration of congress whether may not be advisable to revise the law with a view to this desirable result be submit also whether may not be proper to designate by law the several port or place along the coast at which only foreign ship of war and privateer may be admit the difficulty of sustain the regulation of commerce and of other important interest from abuse without such designation furnish a strong motive for this measure at the time of the negotiation for the renewal of the commercial convention between the|united|state and great|britain a hope have be entertain that an article may have be agree upon mutually satisfactory to both country regulate upon principle of justice and reciprocity the commercial intercourse between the|united|state and the british possession as well in the|west|indy as upon the continent of north|america the plenipotentiary of the government not have be able to come to an agreement on this important interest those of the|united|state reserve for the consideration of this government the proposal which have be present to as the ultimate offer on the part of the|british|government and which be not authorize to accept on transmission here be examine with due deliberation the result of which be a new effort to meet the view of the|british|government the minister of the|united|state be instruct to make a further proposal which have not be accept be however decline in an amicable manner recommend to the consideration of congress whether further prohibitory provision in the law relate to this intercourse may not be expedient be see with interest that although have not be practicable as yet to agree in any arrangement of this important branch of commerce such be the disposition of the party that each will view any regulation which the other may make respect in the most friendly light by the 5th article of the convention conclude on be stipulate that the difference which have arise between the government with respect to the true intent and meaning of the 5th article of the treaty of ghent in relation to the carrying away by british officer of slave from the|united|state after the exchange of the ratification of the treaty of peace should be refer to the decision of some friendly sovereign or state to be name for that purpose the minister of the|united|state have be instruct to name to a foreign sovereign the common friend to both party for the decision of this question the answer of that government to the proposal when receive will indicate the further measure to be pursue on the part of the|united|state although the pecuniary embarrassment which affect various part of the union during the latter part of the|preceding|year have during the present be considerably augment and still continue to exist the receipt into the treasury to the|30th|of|september last have amount to after defray the current expense of the government include the interest and reimbursement of the public debt payable to that period amount to m there remain in the treasury on that|day m which with the sum receivable during the remainder of the|year will exceed the current demand upon the treasury for the same period the cause which have tend to diminish the public receipt could not fail to have a corresponding effect upon the revenue which have accrue upon impost and tonnage during the|three|first|quarters|of|the|present|year be however ascertain that the duty which have be secure during that period exceed m and those of the|whole|year will probably amount to for the probably receipt of the|next|year refer to the statement which will be transmit from the treasury which will enable to judge whether further provision be necessary the great reduction in the price of the principal article of domestic growth which have occur during the|present|year and the consequent fall in the price of labor apparently so favorable to the success of domestic manufacture have not shield against other cause adverse to prosperity the pecuniary embarrassment which have so deeply affect the commercial interest of the nation have be no less adverse to manufacturing establishment in several section of the union the great reduction of the currency which the bank have be constrain to make in order to continue specie payment and the vitiated character of where such reduction have not be attempt instead of place within the reach of these establishment the pecuniary aid necessary to avail of the advantage result from the reduction in the price of the raw material and of labor have compel the bank to withdraw from a portion of the capital heretofore advanced to that aid which have be refuse by the bank have not be obtain from other source owe to the loss of individual confidence from the frequent failure which have recently occur in some of principal commercial city an additional cause for the depression of these establishment may probably be find in the pecuniary embarrassment which have recently affect those country with which commerce have be principally prosecute manufacture for the want of a ready or profitable market at home have be ship by the manufacturer to the|united|state and in many instance sell at a price below current value at the place of manufacture although this practice may from nature be consider temporary or contingent be not on that account less injurious in effect uniformity in the demand and price of an article be highly desirable to the domestic manufacturer be deem of great importance to give encouragement to domestic manufacturer in what manner the evil which have be advert to may be remedie and how far may be practicable in other respect to afford to further encouragement pay due regard to the other great interest of the nation be submit to the wisdom of congress the survey of the coast for the establishment of fortification be now nearly complete and considerable progress have be make in the collection of material for the construction of fortification in the|gulf|of|mexico and in the|chesapeake|bay the work on the eastern bank of the potomac below alexandria and on in the delaware be much advanced and be expect that the fortification at the narrows in the harbor of ny will be complete the|present|year to derive all the advantage contemplate from these fortification be necessary that should be judiciously post and construct with a view to permanence the progress hitherto have therefore be slow but as the difficulty in part heretofore the least explore and know be surmount will in future be more rapid as soon as the survey of the coast be complete which be expect will be do early in the|next|spring the engineer employ in will proceed to examine for like purpose the northern and northwestern frontier the troop intend to occupy a station at the mouth of the|st.|peters on the mississippi have establish there and those who be order to the mouth of the|yellow|stone on the missouri have ascend that river to the|council|bluff where will remain until the|next|spring when will proceed to the place of destination have the satisfaction to state that this measure have be execute in amity with the indian tribe and that promise to produce in regard to all the advantage which be contemplate by much progress have likewise be make in the construction of ship of war and in the collection of timber and other material for ship building be not doubt that navy will soon be augment to the number and place in all respect on the footing provide for by law the board consist of engineer and naval officer have not yet make final report of site for naval depot as instruct accord to the resolution of and but have examine the coast therein designate and report be expect in the|next|month for the protection of commerce in the mediterranean along the southern atlantic coast in the pacific and indian ocean have be find necessary to maintain a strong naval force which seem proper for the present to continue there be much reason to believe that if any portion of the squadron heretofore station in the mediterranean should be withdraw intercourse with the power border on that sea would be much interrupt if not altogether destroy such too have be the growth of a spirit of piracy in the other quarter mention by adventurer from every country in abuse of the friendly flag which have assume that not to protect commerce there would be to abandon have a prey to rapacity due attention have likewise be pay to the suppression of the slave trade in compliance with a law of the last session order have be give to the commander of all public ship to seize all vessel navigate under flag engage in that trade and to bring in to be proceed against in the manner prescribe by the law be hope that these vigorous measure support by like act by other nation will soon terminate a commerce so disgraceful to the civilized world in the execution of the duty impose by these act and of a high trust connect with be with deep regret have to state the loss which have be sustain by the death of commodore|perry gallantry in a brilliant exploit in the late war add to the renown of country death be deplore as a national misfortune transcript of the senate and of the|house|of|representatives the auspicious circumstance under which will commence the duty of the present session will lighten the burden inseparable from the high trust commit to the fruit of the earth have be unusually abundant commerce have flourish the revenue have exceed the most favorable anticipation and peace and amity be preserve with foreign nation on condition just and honorable to country for these inestimable blessing can not but be grateful to that providence which watch over the destiny of nation as the term limit for the operation of the commercial convention with great|britain will expire early|in|the|month|of|july|next and be deem important that there should be no interval during which that portion of commerce which be provide for by that convention should not be regulate either by arrangement between the government or by the authority of congress the minister of the|united|state at london be instruct early in the|last|summer to invite the attention of the|british|government to the subject with a view to that object be instruct to propose also that the negotiation which be wish to open may extend to the general commerce of the country and to every other interest and unsettled difference between in the hope that an arrangement may be make on principle of reciprocal advantage which may comprehend and provide in a satisfactory manner for all these high concern have the satisfaction to state that the proposal be receive by the|british|government in the spirit which prompt and that a negotiation have be open at london embrace all these object on full consideration of the great extent and magnitude of the trust be think proper to commit to not of distinguished citizen and in consequence the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the|united|state at paris have be associate with envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary at london to both of whom correspond instruction have be give and be now engage in the discharge of duty be proper to add that to prevent any inconvenience result from the delay incident to a negotiation on so many important subject be agree before enter on that the exist convention should be continue for a term not less|than|eight|year relation with spain remain nearly in the state in which be at the close of the last session the convention of provide for the adjustment of a certain portion of the claim of citizen for injury sustain by spoliation and so long suspend by the|spanish|government have at length be ratify by but no arrangement have yet be make for the payment of another portion of like claim not less extensive or well found or for other class of claim or for the settlement of boundary these subject have again be bring under consideration in both country but no agreement have be enter into respect in the mean time event have occur which clearly prove the ill effect of the policy which that government have so long pursue on the friendly relation of the country which be presume be at least of as much importance to spain as to the|united|state to maintain a state of thing have exist in the floridas the tendency of which have be obvious to all who have pay the slight attention to the progress of affair in that|quarter throughout the whole of those provinces to which the spanish title extend the|government|of|spain have scarcely be feel authority have be confine almost exclusively to the wall of pensacola and st.|augustine within which only small garrison have be maintain adventurer from every country fugitive from justice and abscond slave have find an asylum there several tribe of indians strong in the # of warrior remarkable for ferocity and whose settlement extend to limit inhabit those provinces these different horde of people connect together disregard on the side the authority of spain and protect on the other by an imaginary line which separate florida from the|united|state have violate law prohibit the introduction of slave have practice various fraud on revenue and commit every kind of outrage on peaceable citizen which proximity to enable to perpetrate the invasion of amelia|island last|year by a small band of adventurer not exceed in number who wrest from the inconsiderable spanish force station there and hold several|months during which a single feeble effort only be make to recover which fail clearly prove how completely extinct the spanish authority have become as the conduct of those adventurer while in possession of the island as distinctly show the pernicious purpose for which combination have be form this country have in fact become the theater of every specie of lawless adventure with little population of own the spanish authority almost extinct and the colonial government in a state of revolution have no pretension to and sufficiently employ in own concern be in great measure derelict and the object of cupidity to every adventurer a system of buccaneering be rapidly organize over which menace in consequence the lawful commerce of every nation and particularly the|united|state while present a temptation to every people on whose seduction success principally depend in regard to the|united|state the pernicious effect of this unlawful combination be not confine to the ocean the indian tribe have constitute the effective force in florida with these tribe these adventurer have form at an early period a connection with a view to avail of that force to promote own project of accumulation and aggrandizement be to the interference of some of these adventurer in misrepresent the claim and title of the indians to land and in practice on savage propensity that the seminole war be principally to be trace man who thus connect with savage community and stimulate to war which be always attend on part with act of barbarity the most shocking deserve to be view in a bad light than the savage would certainly have no claim to an immunity from the punishment which accord to the rule of warfare practice by the savage may justly be inflict on the savage if the embarrassment of spain prevent from make an indemnity to citizen for so long a time from treasury for loss by spoliation and otherwise be always in power to have provide by the cession of this territory of this government have be repeatedly apprise and the cession be the more to have be anticipate as spain must have know that in cede would likewise relieve from the important obligation secure by the|treaty|of|1795 and all other compromitment respect if the|united|state from consideration of these embarrassment decline press claim in a spirit of hostility the motive ought at least to have be duly appreciate by the|government|of|spain be well known to government that other power have make to the|united|states an indemnity for like loss sustain by citizen at the same epoch there be nevertheless a limit beyond which this spirit of amity and forbearance can in no instance be justify if be proper to rely on amicable negotiation for an indemnity for loss would not have be so to have permit the inability of spain to fulfill engagement and to sustain authority in the floridas to be pervert by foreign adventurer and savage to purpose so destructive to the life of fellow citizen and the high interest of the|united|state the right of self defense never cease be among the most sacred and alike necessary to nation and to individual and whether the attack be make by spain or by those who abuse power obligation be not the less strong the invader of amelia|island have assume a popular and respected title under which may approach and wound as object be distinctly see and the duty impose on the executive by an exist law be profoundly feel that mask be not permit to protect be think incumbent on the|united|state to suppress the establishment and be accordingly do the combination in florida for the unlawful purpose state the act perpetrate by that combination and above all the incitement of the indians to massacre fellow citizen of every age and of both sex merit a like treatment and receive in pursue these savage to an imaginary line in the wood would have be the height of folly to have suffer that line to protect have that be do the war could never cease even if the territory have be exclusively that of spain and power complete over have a right by the law of nation to follow the enemy on and to subdue there but the territory belong in a certain sense at least to the savage enemy who inhabit the power of spain have cease to exist over and protection be seek under title by those who have commit on citizen hostility which be bind by treaty to have prevent but have not the power to prevent to have stop at that line would have give new encouragement to these savage and new vigor to the whole combination exist there in the prosecution of all pernicious purpose in suppress the establishment at amelia|island no unfriendliness be manifest toward spain because the post be take from a force which have wrest from the measure be true be not adopt in concert with the|spanish|government or those in authority under because in transaction connect with the war in which spain and the colony be engage be think proper in do justice to the|united|state to maintain a strict impartiality toward both the belligerent party without consult or act in concert with either give pleasure to state that and venezuela whose name be assume have explicitly disclaim all participation in those measure and even the knowledge of until communicate by this government and have also express satisfaction that a course of proceeding have be suppress which if justly imputable to would dishonor cause in authorize major general jackson to enter florida in pursuit of the seminoles care be take not to encroach on the right of spain regret to have to add that in execute this order fact be disclose respect the conduct of the officer of spain in authority there in encourage the war furnish munition of war and other supply to carry on and in other act not less mark which evince participation in the hostile purpose of that combination and justify the confidence with which inspire the savage that by those officer would be protect a conduct so incompatible with the friendly relation exist between the country particularly with the positive obligation of the 5th article of the|treaty|of|1795 by which spain be bind to restrain even by force those savage from act of hostility against the|united|state could not fail to excite surprise the command general be convince that should fail in object that should in effect accomplish nothing if do not deprive those savage of the resource on which have calculate and of the protection on which have rely in make the war as all the document relate to this occurrence will be lay before congress be not necessary to enter into further detail respect although the reason which induce major general jackson to take these post be duly appreciate there be nevertheless no hesitation in decide on the course which become the government to pursue as there be reason to believe that the commander of these post have violate instruction there be no disposition to impute to government a conduct so unprovoked and hostile an order be in consequence issue to the general in command there to deliver the post pensacola unconditionally to any person duly authorize to receive and st.|marks which be in the heart of the indian country on the arrival of a competent force to defend against those savage and associate in enter florida to suppress this combination no idea be entertain of hostility to spain and however justifiable the commanding general be in consequence of the misconduct of the spanish officer in enter st.|marks and pensacola to terminate by prove to the savage and associate that should not be protect even there yet the amicable relation exist between the|united|state and spain could not be alter by that act alone by order the restitution of the post those relation be preserve to a change of the power of the executive be deem incompetent be vest in congress only by this measure so promptly take due respect be show to the|government|of|spain the misconduct of officer have not be impute to be enable to review with candor relation with the|united|state and own situation particularly in respect to the territory in question with the danger inseparable from and regard the loss have sustain for which indemnity have be so long withhold and the injury have suffer through that territory and mean of redress be likewise enable to take with honor the course best calculate to do justice to the|united|state and to promote own welfare copy of the instruction to the commanding general of correspondence with the secretary of war explain motif and justify conduct with a copy of the proceeding of the courts- martial in the trial of arbuthnot and ambristie and of the correspondence between the secretary of state and the minister plenipotentiary of spain near this government and of the minister plenipotentiary of the|united|state at madrid with the|government|of|spain will be lay before congress the civil war which have so long prevail between spain and the provinces in south|america still continue without any prospect of speedy termination the information respect the condition of those country which have be collect by the commissioner recently return from thence will be lay before congress in copy of report with such other information as have be receive from other agent of the|united|state appear from these communication that the|government|at|buenos|ayre declare independent in 1816|july have previously exercise the power of an independent government though in the name of the king of spain from the|year|1810 that the|banda|oriental entre|rios and paraguay with the city of santa|fee all of which be also independent be unconnected with the present government|of|buenos|ayre that chili have declare independent and be closely connect with buenos|ayre that venezuela have also declare independent and now maintain the conflict with various success and that the remain part of south|america except monte|video and such other portion of the eastern bank of the|la|plata as be hold by portugal be still in the possession of spain or in a certain degree under influence by a circular note address by the minister of spain to the ally power with whom be respectively accredit appear that the ally have undertake to mediate between spain and the|south|american|province and that the manner and extent of interposition would be settle by a congress which be to have meet at aix la chapelle in september last from the general policy and course of proceed observe by the ally power in regard to this contest be infer that will confine interposition to the expression of sentiment abstain from the application of force state this impression that force will not be apply with the great satisfaction because be a course more consistent with justice and likewise authorize a hope that the calamity of the war will be confine to the party only and will be of short duration from the view take of this subject found on all the information that have be able to obtain there be good cause to be satisfied with the course heretofore pursue by the|united|state in regard to this contest and to conclude that be proper to adhere to especially in the present state of affair have great satisfaction in state that relation with france russia and other power continue on the most friendly basis in domestic concern have ample cause of satisfaction the receipt into the treasury during the|three|first|quarters|of|the|year have exceed after satisfy all the demand which have be make under exist appropriation include the final extinction of the old % stock and the redemption of a moiety of the louisiana debt be estimate that there will remain in the treasury on the|1st|day|of|january next be ascertain that the gross revenue which have accrue from the custom during the same period amount to m and that the revenue of the|whole|year may be estimate at not less|than|$26m. the sale of the public land during the|year have also greatly exceed both in quantity and price that of any|former|year and there be just reason to expect a progressive improvement in that source of revenue be gratify to know that although the annual expenditure have be increase by the act of the last session of congress provide for revolutionary pension to an amount about equal to the proceed of the internal duty which be then repeal the revenue for the|ensuing|year will be proportionally augment and that whilst the public expenditure will probably remain stationary each successive year will add to the national resource by the ordinary increase of population and by the gradual development of latent source of national prosperity the strict execution of the revenue law result principally from the salutary provision of the act of the 20th of april last amend the several collection law have be presume secure to domestic manufacture all the relief that can be derive from the duty which have be impose upon foreign merchandise for protection under the influence of this relief several branch of this important national interest have assume great activity and although be hope that other will gradually revive and ultimately triumph over every obstacle yet the expediency of grant further protection be submit to consideration the measure of defense authorize by exist law have be pursue with the zeal and activity due to so important an object and with all the dispatch practicable in so extensive and great an undertaking the survey of maritime and inland frontier have be continue and at the point where be decide to erect fortification the work have be commence and in some instance considerable progress have be make in compliance with resolution of the last session the|board|of|commissioner be direct to examine in a particular manner the part of the coast therein designate and to report opinion of the most suitable site for naval depot this work be in a train of execution the opinion of the board on this subject with a plan of all the work necessary to a general system of defense so far as have be form will be lay before congress in a report from the proper department as soon as can be prepare in conformity with the appropriation of the last session treaty have be form with the quapaw tribe of indians inhabit the country on the arkansaw and the|great|and|little|osage north of the|white|river with the tribe in the|state of indiana with the several tribe within the|state of ohio and and with the chickasaws by which very extensive cession of territory have be make to the|united|state negotiation be now depend with the tribe in the|illinois|territory and with the choctaws by which be expect that other extensive cession will be make take great interest in state that the cession already make which be consider so important to the|united|state have be obtain on condition very satisfactory to the indians with a view to the security of inland frontier have be think expedient to establish strong post at the mouth of yellow|stone|river and at the mandan village on the missouri and at the mouth of st.|peters on the mississippi at no great distance from northern boundary can hardly be presume while such post be maintain in the rear of the indian tribe that will venture to attack peaceable inhabitant a strong hope be entertain that this measure will likewise be productive of much good to the tribe especially in promote the great object of civilization experience have clearly demonstrate that independent savage community can not long exist within the limit of a civilized population the progress of the latter have almost invariably terminate in the extinction of the former especially of the tribe belong to portion of this hemisphere among whom loftiness of sentiment and gallantry in action have be conspicuous to civilize and even to prevent extinction seem to be indispensable that independence as community should cease and that the control of the|united|state over should be complete and undisputed the hunter state will then be more easily abandon and recourse will be have to the acquisition and culture of land and to other pursuit tend to dissolve the tie which connect together as a savage community and to give a new character to every individual present this subject to the consideration of congress on the presumption that may be find expedient and practicable to adopt some benevolent provision have these object in view relative to the tribe within settlement have be necessary during the|present|year to maintain a strong naval force in the mediterranean and in the|gulf|of|mexico and to send some public ship along the southern coast and to by these mean amicable relation with the|barbary|power have be preserve commerce have be protect and right respect the augmentation of navy be advance with a steady progress toward the limit contemplate by law communicate with great satisfaction the accession of another state illinois to union because perceive from the proof afford by the addition already make the regular progress and sure consummation of a policy of which history afford no example and of which the good effect can not be too highly estimate by extend government on the principle of constitution over the vast territory within limit on the lakes and the mississippi and numerous stream new life and vigor be infuse into every part of system by increase the number of the states the confidence of the state government in own security be increase and jealousy of the|national|government proportionally diminish the impracticability of consolidated government for this great and grow nation will be more apparent and will be universally admit incapable of exercise local authority except for general purpose the|general|government will no longer be dread in those case of a local nature and for all the great purpose for which be institute authority will be cherish each government will acquire new force and a great freedom of action within proper sphere other inestimable advantage will follow produce will be augment to an incalculable amount in article of the great value for domestic use and foreign commerce navigation will in like degree be increase and as the shipping of will be employ in the transportation of the vast produce of the western country even those part of the|united|state which be most remote from each other will be further bind together by the strong tie which mutual interest can create the situation of this district be think require the attention of congress by the constitution the power of legislation be exclusively vest in the congress of the|united|state in the exercise of this power in which the people have no participation congress legislate in all case directly on the local concern of the district as this be a departure for a special purpose from the general principle of system may merit consideration whether an arrangement better adapt to the principle of government and to the particular interest of the people may not be devise which will neither infringe the constitution nor affect the object which the provision in question be intend to secure the grow population already considerable and the increase business of the district which be believe already interfere with the deliberation of congress on great national concern furnish additional motif for recommend this subject to consideration when view the great blessing with which country have be favor those which now enjoy and the mean which possess of hand down unimpaire to late posterity attention be irresistibly draw to the source from whence flow let then unite in offer most grateful acknowledgment for these blessing to the divine author of all good transcript fellow citizen of the senate and of the|house|of|representatives at no period of political existence have so much cause to felicitate at the prosperous and happy condition of country the abundant fruit of the earth have fill with plenty an extensive and profitable commerce have greatly augment revenue the public credit have attain an extraordinary elevation preparation for defense in case of future war from which by the experience of all nation ought not to expect to be exempt be advance under a well digest system with all the dispatch which so important a work will admit free government found on the interest and affection of the people have gain and be daily gaining strength local jealousy be rapidly yield to more generous enlarge and enlighten view of national policy for advantage so numerous and highly important be duty to unite in grateful acknowledgement to that omnipotent|bee from whom be derive and in uncease prayer that will endow with virtue and strength to maintain and hand down in utmost purity to late posterity have the satisfaction to inform that an arrangement which have be commence by predecessor with the british government for the reduction of the naval force by great|britain and the|united|state on the lake have be conclude by which be provide that neither party shall keep in service on lake|champlain vessel on lake|ontario more than and on lake|erie and the upper lake to be arm each with cannon only and that all the other armed vessel of both party of which an exact list be interchange shall be dismantle be also agree that the force retain shall be restrict in duty to the internal purpose of each party and that the arrangement shall remain in force until six|month shall have expire after notice give by of the party to the other of desire that should terminate by this arrangement useless expense on both side and what be of still great importance the danger of collision between armed vessel in those inland water which be great be prevent have the satisfaction also to state that the commissioner under the fourth article of the|treaty|of|ghent to whom be refer to decide to which party the several island in the bay of passamaquoddy belong under the treaty of have agree in a report by which all the island in the possession of each party before the late war have be decree to the commissioner act under the other article of the|treaty|of|ghent for the settlement of boundary have also be engage in the discharge of respective duty but have not yet complete the difference which arise between the government under that treaty respect the right of the u.s. to take and cure fish on the coast of the british province north of limit which have be secure by the|treaty|of|1783 be still in negotiation the proposition make by this government to extend to the colony of gb the principle of the convention of london by which the commerce between the port of the|united|state and british port in europe have be place on a footing of equality have be decline by the british government this subject have be thus amicably discuss between the government and appear that the british government be unwilling to depart from present regulation remain for congress to decide whether will make any other regulation in consequence thereof for the protection and improvement of navigation the negotiation with spain for spoliation on commerce and the settlement of boundary remain essentially in the state hold by the communication that be make to congress by predecessor have be evidently the policy of the spanish government to keep the negotiation suspend and in this the|united|state have acquiesce from an amicable disposition toward spain and in the expectation that government would from a sense of justice finally accede to such an arrangement as would be equal between the party a disposition have be lately show by the spanish government to move in the negotiation which have be meet by this government and should the conciliatory and friendly policy which have invariably guide council be reciprocate a just and satisfactory arrangement may be expect be proper however to remark that no proposition have yet be make from which such a result can be presume be anticipate at an early stage that the contest between spain and the colony would become highly interesting to the|united|state be natural that citizen should sympathize in event which affect neighbor seem probable also that the prosecution of the conflict along coast and in contiguous country would occasionally interrupt commerce and otherwise affect the person and property of citizen these anticipation have be realize such injury have be receive from person act under authority of both the party and for which redress have in most instance be withhold through every stage of the conflict the|united|state have maintain an impartial neutrality give aid to neither of the party in man money ship or munition of war have regard the contest not in the light of an ordinary insurrection or rebellion but as a civil war between party nearly equal have as to neutral power equal right port have be open to both and every article the fruit of soil or of the industry of citizen which either be permit to take have be equally free to the other should the colony establish independence be proper now to state that this government neither seek nor would accept from any advantage in commerce or otherwise which will not be equally open to all other nation the colony will in that event become independent state free from any obligation to or connection with which may not then be interest to form on the basis of a fair reciprocity in the|summer|of|the|present|year an expedition be set on foot against east|florida by person claim to act under the authority of some of the colony who take possession of amelia|island at the mouth of the|st.|marys|river near the boundary of the|state of georgia as this province lie eastward of the mississippi and be bound by the|united|state and the ocean on every side and have be a subject of negotiation with the government of spain as an indemnity for loss by spoliation or in exchange for territory of equal value westward of the mississippi a fact well know to the world excite surprise that any countenance should be give to this measure by any of the colony as would be difficult to reconcile with the friendly relation exist between the|united|state and the colony a doubt be entertain whether have be authorize by or any of this doubt have gain strength by the circumstance which have unfold in the prosecution of the enterprise which have mark as a mere private unauthorized adventure project and commence with an incompetent force reliance seem to have be place on what may be draw in defiance of law from within limit and of late as resource have fail have assume a more marked character of unfriendliness to the island be make a channel for the illicit introduction of slave from africa into the|united|state an asylum for fugitive slave from the neighboring state and a port for smuggling of every kind a similar establishment be make at an early period by person of the same description in at a place call galvezton within the limit of the|united|state as contend under the cession of louisiana this enterprise have be mark in a more signal manner by all the objectionable circumstance which characterize the other and more particularly by the equipment of privateer which have annoy commerce and by smuggling these establishment if ever sanction by any authority whatever which be not believe have abuse trust and forfeit all claim to consideration a just regard for the right and interest of the|united|state require that should be suppress and order have be accordingly issue to that effect the imperious consideration which produce this measure will be explain to the party whom may in any degree concern to obtain correct information on every subject in which the|united|state be interested to inspire just sentiment in all person in authority on either side of friendly disposition so far as may comport with an impartial neutrality and to secure proper respect to commerce in every port and from every flag have be think proper to send a ship of war with distinguished citizen along the southern coast with these purpose with the exist authority with those in the possession of and exercise the sovereignty must the communication be hold from alone can redress for past injury commit by person act under be obtain by alone can the commission of the like in future be prevent relation with the other power of europe have experience no essential change since the last session in intercourse with each due attention continue to be pay to the protection of commerce and to every other object in which the|united|state be interested a strong hope be entertain that by adhere to the maxim of a just a candid and friendly policy may long preserve amicable relation with all the power of europe on condition advantageous and honorable to country with the barbary state and the indian tribe pacific relation have be preserve in call attention to the internal concern of country the view which exhibit be peculiarly gratify the payment which have be make into the treasury show the very productive state of the public revenue after satisfy the appropriation make by law for the support of the civil government and of the military and naval establishment embrace suitable provision for fortification and for the gradual

gratify to know that the reservation of land make by the treaty with the tribe on lake|erie be make with a view to individual ownership among and to the cultivation of the soil by all and that an annual stipend have be pledge to supply other want will merit the consideration of congress whether other provision not stipulate by treaty ought to be make for these tribe and for the advancement of the liberal and humane policy of the|united|state toward all the tribe within limit and more particularly for improvement in the art of civilized life among the advantage incident to these purchase and to those which have precede the security which may thereby be afford to inland frontier be peculiarly important with a strong barrier consist of own people thus plant on the lakes the mississippi

necessary and the expense of attend may be save a people accustom to the use of firearm only as the indian tribe be will shun even moderate work which be defend by cannon great fortification will therefore be requisite only in future along the coast and at some point in the interior connect with on these will the safety of town and the commerce of great river from the|bay|of|fundy to the mississippi depend on these therefore should the utmost attention skill and labor be bestow a considerable and rapid augmentation in the value of all the public land proceed from these and other obvious case may henceforward be expect the difficulty attend early emigration will be dissipate even in the most remote part several new state have be admit into union to the west and south and territorial government happily organize establish over every other portion in which there be vacant land for sale in terminate indian hostility as must soon be do in a formidable shape at least the emigration which have heretofore be great will probably increase and the demand for land and the augmentation in value be in like proportion the great increase of population throughout the union will alone produce an important effect and in no|quarter will be so sensibly feel as in those in contemplation the public land be a public stock which ought to be dispose of to the good advantage for the nation the nation should therefore derive the profit proceed from the continual rise in value every encouragement should be give to the emigrant consistent with a fair competition between but that competition should operate in the first sale to the advantage of the nation rather than of individual great capitalist will derive the benefit incident to superior wealth under any mode of sale which may be adopt but if look forward to the rise in the value of the public land should have the opportunity of amass at a low price vast body in hand the profit will accrue to and not to the public would also have the power in that degree to control the emigration and settlement in such a manner as opinion of respective interest may dictate submit this subject to the consideration of congress that such further provision may be make in the sale of the public land with a view to the public interest should any be deem expedient as in judgment may be best adapt to the object when consider the vast extent of territory within the|united|state the great amount and value of production the connection of part and other circumstance on which prosperity and happiness depend can not fail to entertain a high sense of the advantage to be derive from the facility which may be afford in the intercourse between by mean of good road and canal never do a country of such vast extent offer equal inducement to improvement of this kind nor ever be consequence of such magnitude involve in as this subject be act on by congress at the last session and there may be a disposition to revive at the present have bring into view for the purpose of communicate sentiment on a very important circumstance connect with with that freedom and candor which a regard for the public interest and a proper respect for congress require a difference of opinion have exist from the first formation of constitution to the present time among most enlightened and virtuous citizen respect the right of congress to establish such a system of improvement take into view the trust with which be now honor would be improper after what have pass that this discussion should be revive with an uncertainty of opinion respect the right disregard early impression have bestow on the subject all the deliberation which great importance and a just sense of duty require and the result be a settle conviction in mind that congress do not possess the right be not contain in any of the specify power grant to congress nor can consider incidental to or a necessary mean view on the most liberal scale for carry into effect any of the power which be specifically grant in communicate this result can not resist the obligation which feel to suggest to congress the propriety of recommend to the state the adoption of an amendment to the constitution which shall give to congress the right in question in case of doubtful construction especially of such vital interest comport with the nature and origin of institution and will contribute much to preserve to apply to constituent for an explicit grant of the power may confidently rely that if appear to satisfaction that the power be necessary will always be grant in this case be happy to observe that experience have afford the most ample proof of utility and that the benign spirit of conciliation and harmony which now manifest throughout union promise to such a recommendation the most prompt and favorable result think proper to suggest also in case this measure be adopt that be recommend to the state to include in the amendment seek a right in congress to institute likewise

in be considerable and the knowledge acquire in the machinery and fabric of all the most useful manufacture be of great value preservation which depend on due encouragement be connect with the high interest of the nation although the progress of the public building have be as favorable as circumstance have permit be to be regret that the capitol be not yet in a state to receive there be good cause to presume that the wing the only part as yet commence will be prepare for that purpose at the next session the time seem now to have arrive when this subject may be deem worthy the attention of congress on a scale adequate to national purpose the completion of the middle building will be necessary to the convenient accommodation of congress of the committee and various office belong to be evident that the other public building be altogether insufficient for the accommodation of the several executive department some of whom be much crowded and even subject to the necessity of obtain in private building at some distance from the head of the department and with inconvenience to the management of the public business most nation have take an interest and a pride in the improvement and ornament of metropolis and none be more conspicuous in that respect than the ancient republic the policy which dictate the establishment of a permanent residence for the national government and the spirit in which be commence and have be prosecute show that such improvement be think worthy the attention of this nation central position between the northern and southern extreme of union and approach to the west at the head of a great navigable river which interlock with the western water prove the wisdom of the council which establish nothing appear to be more reasonable and proper than that convenient accommodation should be provide on a well digest plan for the head of the several department and for the attorney general and be believe that the public ground in the city apply to these object will be find amply sufficient submit this subject to the consideration of congress that such further provision may be make in as to may seem proper be contemplate the happy situation of the|united|state attention be draw with peculiar interest to the survive officer and soldier of revolutionary army who so eminently contribute by service to lay foundation most of those very meritorious citizen have pay the debt of nature and go to repose be believe that among the survivor there be some not provide for by exist law who be reduce to indigence and even to real distress these man have a claim on the gratitude of country and will do honor to country to provide for the lapse of a|few|year more and the opportunity will be forever lose indeed so long already have be the interval that the number to be benefit by any provision which may be make will not be great appear in a satisfactory manner that the revenue arise from impost and tonnage and from the sale of the public land will be fully adequate to the support of the civil government of the present military and naval establishment include the annual augmentation of the latter to the extent provide for to the payment of the interest of the public debt and to the extinguishment of at the time authorize without the aid of the internal taxis consider duty to recommend to congress repeal to impose taxis when the public exigency require be an obligation of the most sacred character especially with a free people the faithful fulfillment of be among the high proof of value and capacity for self government to dispense with taxis when may be do with perfect safety be equally the duty of representative in this instance have the satisfaction to know that be impose when the demand be imperious and have be sustain with exemplary fidelity have to add that however gratify may be to regard the prosperous and happy condition of country to recommend the repeal of these taxis at this time shall nevertheless be attentive to event and should any future emergency occur be not less prompt to suggest such measure and burden as may then be requisite and proper transcript should be destitute of feeling if be not deeply affected by the strong proof which fellow citizen have give of confidence in call to the high office whose function be about to assume as the expression of good opinion of conduct in the public service derive from a gratification which those who be conscious of have do all that could to merit can alone feel sensibility be increase by a just estimate of the importance of the trust and of the nature and extent of duty with the proper discharge of which the high interest of a great and free people be intimately connect conscious of own deficiency can not enter on these duty without great anxiety for the result from a just responsibility will never shrink calculate with confidence that in good effort to promote the public welfare motif will always be duly appreciate and conduct be view with that candor and indulgence which have experience in other station in commence the duty of the chief executive office have be the practice of the distinguished man who have go before to explain the principle which would govern in respective administrations in follow venerate example attention be naturally draw to the great cause which have contribute in a principal degree to produce the present happy condition of the|united|state will best explain the nature of duty and shed much light on the policy which ought to be pursue in future from the commencement of revolution to the present day almost|forty|year have elapse and from the establishment of this constitution through this whole term the government have be what may emphatically be call self government and what have be the effect to whatever object turn attention whether relate to foreign or domestic concern find abundant cause to felicitate in the excellence of institution during a period fraught with difficulty and mark by very extraordinary event the|united|state have flourish beyond example citizen individually have be happy and the nation prosperous under this constitution commerce have be wisely regulate with foreign nation and between the states new state have be admit into union territory have be enlarge by fair and honorable treaty and with great advantage to the original states the states respectively protect by under a mild parental system against foreign danger and enjoy within separate sphere by a wise partition of power a just proportion of the sovereignty have improve police extend settlement and attain a strength and maturity which be the good proof of wholesome law well administer and if look to the condition of individual what a proud spectacle do exhibit on whom have oppression fall in any|quarter of union who have be deprive of any right of person or property who restrain from offer vow in the mode which prefer to the divine author of being be well know that all these blessing have be enjoy in full extent and add with peculiar satisfaction that there have be no example of a capital punishment be inflict on anyone for the crime of high treason some who may admit the competency of government to these beneficent duty may doubt in trial which put to the test strength and efficiency as a member of the great community of nation here too experience have afford the most satisfactory proof in favor just as this constitution be put into action several of the principal states|of|europe have become much agitated and some of seriously convulse destructive war ensue which have of late only be terminate in the course of these conflict the|united|state receive great injury from several of the party be interest to stand aloof from the contest to demand justice from the party commit the injury and to cultivate by a fair and honorable conduct the friendship of all war become at length inevitable and the result have show that government be equal to that the great of trial under the most unfavorable circumstance of the virtue of the people and of the heroic exploit of the army the navy and the militia need not speak such then be the happy government under which live a government adequate to every purpose for which the social compact be form a government elective in all branch under which every citizen may by merit obtain the high trust recognize by the constitution which contain within no cause of discord none to put at variance portion of the community with another a government which protect every citizen in the full enjoyment of right and be able to protect the nation against injustice from foreign power other consideration of the high importance admonish to cherish union and to cling to the government which support fortunate as be in political institution have not be less so in other circumstance on which prosperity and happiness essentially depend situate within the temperate zone and extend through many degree of latitude along the atlantic the|united|state enjoy all the variety of climate and every production incident to that portion of the globe penetrate internally to the|great|lakes and beyond the source of the great river which communicate through whole interior no country be ever happy with respect to domain bless too with a fertile soil produce have always be very abundant leave even in year the least favorable a surplus for the want of fellow man in other country such be peculiar felicity that there be not a part of union that be not particularly interested in preserve the great agricultural interest of the nation prosper under protection local interest be not less foster by fellow citizen of the north engage in navigation find great encouragement in be make the favor carrier of the vast production of the other portion of the|united|state while the inhabitant of these be amply recompensed in turn by the nursery for seamen and naval force thus form and rear up for the support of common right manufacture find a generous encouragement by the policy which patronize domestic industry and the surplus of produce a steady and profitable market by local want in less favor part at home such then be the highly favor condition of country be the interest of every citizen to maintain what be the danger which menace if any exist ought to be ascertain and guard against in explain sentiment on this subject may be ask what raise to the present happy state how do accomplish the revolution how remedy the defect of the first instrument of union by infuse into the national|government sufficient power for national purpose without impair the just right of the states or affect those of individual how sustain and pass with glory through the late war the government have be in the hand of the people to the people therefore and to the faithful and able depositary of trust be the credit due have the people of the|united|state be educate in different principle have be less intelligent less independent or less virtuous can be believe that should have maintain the same steady and consistent career or be bless with the same success while then the constituent body retain present sound and healthful state everything will be safe will choose competent and faithful representative for every department be only when the people become ignorant and corrupt when degenerate into a populace that be incapable of exercise the sovereignty usurpation be then an easy attainment and an usurper soon find the people become the willing instrument of own debasement and ruin let then look to the great cause and endeavor to preserve in full force let by all wise and constitutional measure promote intelligence among the people as the good mean of preserve liberty danger from abroad be not less deserving of attention experience the fortune of other nation the|united|state may be again involve in war and may in that event be the object of the adverse party to overset government to break union and demolish as a nation distance from europe and the just moderate and pacific policy of government may form some security against these danger but ought to be anticipate and guard against many of citizen be engage in commerce and navigation and all of be in a certain degree dependent on prosperous state many be engage in the fishery these interest be expose to invasion in the war between other power and should disregard the faithful admonition of experience if do not expect must support right or lose character and with perhaps liberty a people who fail to do can scarcely be say to hold a place among independent nation national honor be national property of the high value the sentiment in the mind of every citizen be national strength ought therefore to be cherish to secure against these danger coast and inland frontier should be fortify army and navy regulate upon just principle as to the force of each be keep in perfect order and militia be place on the good practicable footing to put extensive coast in such a state of defense as to secure city and interior from invasion will be attend with expense but the work when finish will be permanent and be fair to presume that a single campaign of invasion by a naval force superior to own aid by a|few|thousand land troop would expose to great expense without take into the estimate the loss of property and distress of citizen than would be sufficient for this great work land and naval force should be moderate but adequate to the necessary purpose the former to garrison and preserve fortification and to meet the first invasion of a foreign foe and while constitute the element of a great force to preserve the science as well as all the necessary implement of war in a state to be bring into activity in the event of war the latter retain within the limit proper in a state of peace may aid in maintain the neutrality of the|united|state with dignity in the war of other power and in save the property of citizen from spoliation in time of war with the enlargement of which the great naval resource of the country render susceptible and which should be duly foster in time of peace would contribute essentially both as an auxiliary of defense and as a powerful engine of annoyance to diminish the calamity of war and to bring the war to a speedy and honorable termination but ought always to be hold prominently in view that the safety of these states and of everything dear to a free people must depend in an eminent degree on the militia invasion may be make too formidable to be resist by any land and naval force which would comport either with the principle of government or the circumstance of the|united|state to maintain in such case recourse must be have to the great body of the people and in a manner to produce the good effect be of the high importance therefore that be so organized and train as to be prepare for any emergency the arrangement should be such as to put at the command of the government the ardent patriotism and youthful vigor of the country if form on equal and just principle can not be oppressive be the crisis which make the pressure and not the law which provide a remedy for this arrangement should be form too in time of peace to be the better prepare for war with such an organization of such a people the|united|state have nothing to dread from foreign invasion at approach an overwhelming force of gallant man may always be put in motion other interest of high importance will claim attention among which the improvement of country by road and canal proceed

strong a more interesting spectacle be perhaps never see than be exhibit within the limit of the|united|state a territory so vast and advantageously situate contain object so grand so useful so happily connect in all part manufacturer will likewise require the systematic and foster care of the government possess as do all the raw material the fruit of own soil and industry ought not to depend in the degree have do on supply from other country while be thus dependent the sudden event of war unsought and unexpected can not fail to plunge into the most serious difficulty be important too that the capital which nourish manufacturer should be domestic as influence in that case instead of exhaust as may do in foreign hand would be feel advantageously on agriculture and every other

advantage of civilization the great amount of revenue and the flourish state of the treasury be a full proof of the competency of the national resource for any emergency as be of the willingness of fellow citizen to bear the burden which the public necessity require the vast amount of vacant land the value of which daily augment form an additional resource of great extent and duration these resource besides accomplish every other necessary purpose put completely in the power of the|united|state to discharge the national debt at an early period peace be the good time for improvement and preparation of every kind be in peace that commerce flourish most that taxis be most easily pay and that the revenue be most productive the executive be charge officially in the departments under with

already so conspicuously display in favor transcript to the|house|of|representatives of the|united|state have consider the bill this|day present to entitle an act to set apart and pledge certain fund for internal improvement and which set apart and pledge fund for construct road and canal and improve the navigation of water course in order to facilitate promote and give security to internal commerce among the several states and to render more easy and less expensive the mean and provision for the common defense be constrain by the insuperable difficulty feel in reconcile the bill with the|united|state to return with that objection to the|house|of|representatives in which originate the legislative power vest in congress be specify and enumerate in the eighth section of the first article of the constitution and do not appear that the power propose to be exercise by the bill be among the enumerate power or that fall by any just interpretation within the power to make law necessary and proper for carry into execution those or other power vest by the|constitution|in|the|government|of the|united|state the power to regulate commerce among the several state can not include a power to construct road and canal and to improve the navigation of water course in order to facilitate promote and secure such a commerce without a latitude of construction depart from the ordinary import of the term strengthen by the know inconvenience which doubtless lead to the grant of this remedial power to congress to refer the power in question to the clause to provide for the common defense and general welfare would be contrary to the establish and consistent rule of interpretation as render the special and careful enumeration of power which follow the clause nugatory and improper such a view of the constitution would have the effect of give to congress a general power of legislation instead of the define and limited hitherto understand to belong to the term common defense and general welfare embrace every object and act within the purview of a legislative trust would have the effect of subject both the constitution and law of the several states in all case not specifically exempt to be supersede by law of congress be expressly declare that the|united|state and law make in pursuance thereof shall be the supreme law of the land and the judge of every state shall be bind thereby anything in the constitution or law of any state to the contrary notwithstanding such a view of the constitution finally would have the effect of exclude the judicial authority of the|united|state from participation in guard the boundary between the legislative power of the general and the state governments inasmuch as question relate to the general welfare be question of policy and expediency be unsusceptible of judicial cognizance and decision a restriction of the power to provide for the common defense and general welfare to case which be to be provide for by the expenditure of money would still leave within the legislative power of congress all the great and most important measure of government money be the ordinary and necessary mean of carry into execution if a general power to construct road and canal and to improve the navigation of water course with the train of power incident thereto be not possess by congress the assent of the states in the mode provide in the bill can not confer the power the only case in which the consent and cession of particular states can extend the power of congress be those specify and provide for in the constitution be not unaware of the great importance of road and canal and the improved navigation of water course and that a power in the|national|legislature to provide for may be exercise with signal advantage to the general prosperity but see that such a power be not expressly give by the constitution and believe that can not be deduce from any part of without an inadmissible latitude of construction and a reliance on insufficient precedent believe also that the permanent success of the constitution depend on a definite partition of power between the general and the|state|government and that no adequate landmark would be leave by the constructive extension of the power of congress as propose in the bill have no option but to withhold signature from and to cherish the hope that beneficial object may be attain by a resort for the necessary power to the same wisdom and virtue in the nation which establish the constitution in actual form and providently mark out in the instrument a safe and practicable mode of improve as experience may suggest james|madison transcript of the senate and of the|house|of|representatives in review the present state of country attention can not be withhold

regret that a depression be experience by particular branch of manufacture and by a portion of navigation as the first proceed in an essential degree from an excess of import merchandise which carry a check in own tendency the cause in present extent can not be very long in duration the evil will not however be view by congress without a recollection that manufacture establishment if suffer to sink too low or languish too long may not revive after the cause shall have cease and that in the vicissitude of human affair situation may recur in which a dependence on foreign source for indispensable supply may be among the most serious embarrassment the depressed state of navigation be to be ascribe in a material degree to exclusion from the colonial port of the nation most extensively connect

recommend to the consideration of congress a reorganization of the militia on a plan which will form into class accord to the period of life more or less adapt to military service an efficient militia be authorize and contemplate by the constitution and require by the spirit and safety of free government the present organization of militia be universally regard as less efficient than ought to be make and no organization can be better calculate to give to due force than a classification which will assign the foremost place in the defense of the country to that portion of citizen whose activity and animation best enable to rally to standard besides the consideration that a time of peace be the time when the change can be make with most convenience and equity will now be aid by the experience of a recent war in which the militia bear so interesting a part congress will call to mind that no adequate provision have yet be make for the uniformity of weight and measure also contemplate by the constitution the great utility of a standard fix in nature and found on the easy rule of decimal proportion be sufficiently obvious lead the government at an early stage to preparatory step for introduce and a completion of the work will be a just title to the public gratitude the importance which have attach to the establishment of a university within this district on a scale and for object worthy of the american nation induce to renew recommendation of to the favorable consideration of congress and particularly invite again attention to the expediency of exercise exist power and where

early attention of the legislature will be a seasonable occasion also for inquire how far legislative interposition may be further requisite in provide penalty for offense designate in the constitution or in the statute and to which either no penalty be annex or none with sufficient certainty and submit to the wisdom of congress whether a more enlarged revisal of the criminal code be not expedient for the purpose of mitigating in certain case penalty which be adopt into antecedent to experiment and example which justify and recommend a more lenient policy the|united|state have be the first to abolish within the extent of authority the transportation of the native of africa into slavery by prohibit the introduction of slave and by punish citizen participate in the traffic can not but be gratify at the progress make by concurrent effort of other nation toward a general suppression of so great an evil must feel at the same time the great solicitude to give the full efficacy to own regulation with that view the interposition of congress appear to be require by the violation and evasion which be suggest be chargeable on unworthy citizen who mingle in the slave trade under foreign flag and with foreign port and by collusive importation of slave into the|united|state through adjoin port and territory present the subject to congress with a full assurance of disposition to apply all the remedy which can be afford by an amendment of the law the regulation which be intend to guard against abuse of a kindre character in the trade between the several states ought also to be render more effectual for humane object to these recommendation add for the consideration of congress the expediency of a remodification of the judiciary establishment and of an additional department in the executive branch of the government the first be call for by the accrue business which necessarily swell the duty of the federal court and by the great and widen space within which justice be to be dispense by the time seem to have arrive which claim for member of the|supreme|court a relief from itinerary fatigue incompatible as well with the age which a portion of will always have attain as with the research and preparation which be due to station and to the juridical reputation of country and consideration equally cogent require a more convenient organization of the subordinate tribunal

a proper depository of official opinion and proceeding there be include in the provision the usual appurtenance to a public office in direct the legislative attention to the state of the finance be a subject of great gratification to find that even within the short period which have elapse since the return of peace the revenue have far exceed all the current demand upon the treasury and that under any probable diminution of future annual product which the vicissitude of commerce may occasion will afford an ample fund for the effectual and early extinguishment of the public debt have be estimate that during the|year|1816 the actual receipt of revenue at the treasury include the balance at the commencement of the|year and exclude the proceed of loan and treasury note will amount to about the

abroad the local accumulation of the revenue have already enable the treasury to meet the public engagement in the local currency of most of the states and be expect that the same cause will produce the same effect throughout the union but for the interest of the community at large as well as for the purpose of the treasury be essential that the nation should possess a currency of equal value credit and use wherever may circulate the constitution have intrust congress exclusively with the power of create and regulate a currency of that description and the measure which be take during the

those measure for a more enlarged view of the public finance with a view of the measure pursue by the|treasury|department previous to the resignation of the late secretary transmit an extract from the

with the disposition of the|united|state which may be hope will be improve into liberal arrangement on other subject on which the party have mutual interest or which may endanger future harmony congress will decide on the expediency of promote such a sequel by give effect to the measure of confine the american navigation to american seaman a measure which at the same time that may have that conciliatory tendency would have the further advantage of increase the independence of navigation and the resource for maritime defence in conformity with the article in the treaty of ghent relate to the indians as well as with a view to the tranquillity of western and northwestern frontier measure be take to establish an immediate peace with the several tribe who have be engage in hostility

hospital and garrison render a complete execution of the act impracticable on the ist of may the period more immediately contemplate as soon however as circumstance would permit and as far as have be practicable consistently with the public interest the reduction of the army have be accomplish but the appropriation for pay and for other branch of the military service have prove inadequate the early attention to that subject will be necessary and the expediency of continue upon the peace establishment the staff officer who have hitherto be provisionally retain be also recommend to the consideration of congress in the performance of the executive duty upon this occasion there have not be want a just sensibility to the merit of the|american|army during the late war but the obvious policy and design in fix an efficient military peace establishment do not afford an opportunity to distinguish the aged and infirm on account of past service nor the wounded and disabled on account of present suffering the extent of the reduction indeed unavoidably involve the exclusion of many meritorious officer of every rank from the service of country and so equal as well as so numerous be the claim to attention that a decision by the standard of comparative merit could seldom be attain judged how ever in candor by a general standard of positive merit the army register will be believe do honor to the establish ment while the case of those officer whose name be not in eluded in devolve with the strong interest upon the legislative authority for such provision as shall be deem the good calculate to give support and solace to the veteran and the invalid to display the beneficence as well as the justice of the government and to inspire a martial zeal for the public service upon every future emergency although the embarrassment arise from the want of an uniform national currency have not be diminish since the adjournment of congress great satisfaction have be denve in contemplate the revival of the public credit and the effi ciency of the public resource the receipt into the treasury from the vanous branch of revenue during the|nine|months|ending|on|the|30th|of|september last have be estimate at the issue of treasury note of every denomination during the same period amount to the sum of and there be also obtain upon loan during the same period a sum of of which the sum of be subscribe in cash and the sum of in treasury note with these mean add to the sum of be the balance of money in the treasury on the|ist|day|of|january there have be pay be tween the ist of january

payment of du tie and taxis the aggregate sum of leave a balance then in the treasury estimate at the sum of independent however of the arrearage due for military service and supply be presume that a further sum of include the interest on the public debt payable on the ist of january next will be demand at the treasury to compete the expenditure of the|present|year and for which the exist way and mean will sufficiently provide the national debt as be ascertain on the ist of octo ber last amount in the whole to the sum of consist of the unredeemed balance of the debt contract before the late war the amount of the fund debt contract in consequence of the war and the amount of the unfunded and float debt include the vanous issue of treasury note which be in a gradual course of payment there will probably be some ad dition to the public debt upon the liquidation of various claim which be depend and a conciliatory disposition on the part of congress may lead honorably and advantageously to an equitable arrangement of the militia expense incur by the several states without the previous sanction or authority of but when be consider that the new as well as the old portion of the debt have be contract in the assertion of the national right and independence and when be recollect that the public expenditure not be exclusively bestow upon subject of a transient nature will long be visible in the number and equip ment of the|american|navy in the military work for the fense of harbor and frontier and in the supply of arsenal and magazine the amount will bear a gratify comparison with the object which have be attain as well as with the resource of the country the arrangement of the finance with a view to the receipt and expenditure of a permanent peace establishment will necessarily enter into the deliberation of congress during the present session be true that the improved condition of the public revenue will not only afford the mean of maintain the faith of the government with creditor inviolate and of prosecute successfully the measure of the most liberal policy but will also justify an immediate alleviation of the burden impose by the necessity of the war be however essential to every modification of the finance that the benefit of an uniform national currency should be restore to the community the absence of the precious metal will be believe be a temporary evil but until can again be render the general medium of exchange devolve on the wisdom of congress to provide a substitute which shall equally engage the confidence and accommodate the want of the citizen throughout the union if the operation of the state bank can not produce this result the probable operation of a national bank will merit consideration and if neither of these expedient be deem effectual may become necessary to ascertain the term upon which the note of the government no longer require as an instrument of credit shall be issue upon motif of general policy as a common medium of circulation notwithstanding the security for future repose which the|united|state ought to find in love of peace and constant respect for the right of other nation the character of the time particularly inculcate the lesson that whether to prevent or repel danger ought not to be unprepared for this consideration will sufficiently recommend to congress a liberal provision for the immediate extension and gradual completion of the work of defense both fix and float on maritime frontier and an adequate provision for guard inland frontier against danger to which certain portion of may continue to be expose as an improvement in military establishment will deserve the consideration of congress whether a corps of invalid may not be so organized and employ as at once to aid in the support of meritorious individual exclude by age or infirmity from the exist establishment and to procure to the public the benefit of stationary service and of exemplary discipline recommend also an enlargement of the|military|academy already establish and the establishment of other in other section of the union and can not press too much on the attention of congress such a classification and organization of the militia as will most effectually render the safeguard of a free state if experience have shew in the recent splendid achievement of militia the value of this resource for the public defense have shew also the importance of that skill in the use of arm and that familiarity with the essential rule of discipline which can not be expect from the regulation now in force with this subject be intimately connect the necessity of accommodate the law in every respect to the great object of enable the political authority of the union to employ promptly and effectually the physical power of the union in the case designate by the constitution the signal service which have be render by navy and the capacity have develop for successful co - operation in the national defense will give to that portion of the public force full value in the eye of congress at an epoch which call for the constant vigilance of all government to preserve the ship now in a sound state to complete those already contemplate to provide amply the imperishable material for prompt augmentation and to improve the exist arrangement into more advantageous establishment for the construction the repair and the security of vessel of war be dictate by the sound policy in adjust the duty on import to the object of revenue the influence of the tariff on manufacture will necessarily present for consideration however wise the theory may be which leave to the sagacity and interest of individual the application of industry and resource there be in this as in other case exception to the general rule besides the condition which the theory imply of a reciprocal adoption by other nation experience teach that so many circumstance must concur in introduce and mature manufacturing establishment especially of the more complicated kind that a country may remain long without although sufficiently advanced and in some respect even peculiarly fit for carry on with success under circumstance give a powerful impulse to manufacture industry have make among a progress and exhibit an efficiency which justify the belief that with a protection not more than be due to the enterprise citizen whose interest be now at stake will become at an early day not only safe against occasional competition from abroad but a source of domestic wealth and even of external commerce in select the branch more especially entitle to the public patronage a preference be obviously claim by such as will relieve the|united|state from a dependence on foreign supply ever subject to casual failure for article necessary for the public defense or connect with the primary want of individual will be an additional recommendation of particular manufacture where the material for be extensively draw from agriculture and consequently impart and insure to that great fund of national prosperity and independence an encouragement which can not fail to be reward among the mean of advance the public interest the occasion be a proper one for recall the attention of congress to the great importance of establish throughout country the road and canal which can best be execute under the national authority no object within the circle of political economy so richly repay the expense bestow on there be none the utility of which be more universally ascertain and acknowledge none that do more honor to the government whose wise and enlarged patriotism duly appreciate nor be there any country which present a field where nature invite more the art of man to complete own work for accommodation and benefit these consideration be strengthen moreover by the political effect of these facility for intercommunication in bring and bind more closely together the various part of extended confederacy whilst the states individually with a laudable enterprise and emulation avail of local advantage by new road by navigable canal and by improve the stream susceptible of navigation the|general|government be the more urged to similar undertaking require a national jurisdiction and national mean by the prospect of thus systematically complete so inestimable a work and be a happy reflection that any defect of constitutional authority which may be encounter can be supply in a mode which the constitution have providently point out the present be a favorable season also for bring again into view the establishment of a national seminary of learn within the|district|of|columbia and with mean draw from the property therein subject to the authority of the|general|government such an institution claim the patronage of congress as a monument of solicitude for the advancement of knowledge without which the blessing of liberty can not be fully enjoy or long preserve as a model instructive in the formation of other seminary as a nursery of enlighten preceptor and as a central resort of youth and genius from every part of country diffuse on return example of those national feeling those liberal

for the guardian of the public welfare to persevere in that justice and good will toward other nation which invite a return of these sentiment toward the|united|state to cherish institution which guarantee safety and liberty civil and religious and to combine with a liberal system of foreign commerce an improvement of the national advantage and a protection and extension of the independent

congress copy of the treaty of peace and amity between the|united|state and his|britannic|majesty which be sign by the commissioner of both party at ghent on the|24th|of|december,|1814 and the ratification of which have be duly exchange while perform this act congratulate and constituent upon an event which be highly honorable to the nation and terminate with peculiar felicity a campaign signalize by the most brilliant success the late war although reluctantly declare by congress have become a necessary resort to assert the right and independence of the nation have be wag with a success which be the natural result of the wisdom of the legislative council of the patriotism of the people of the public spirit of the militia and of the valor of the military and naval force of the country peace at all time a blessing be peculiarly wel come therefore at a period when the cause for the war have cease to operate when the government have demonstrate the efficiency of power of defense and when the nation can review conduct without regret and without reproach recommend to care and beneficence the gallant man whose achievement in every department of the military ser vice on the land and on the water have so essentially con tribute to the honor of the american name and to the restoration of peace the feeling of conscious patriotism and worth will animate such man under every change of for tune and pursuit but country perform a duty to when bestow those testimonial of approbation and applause which be at once the reward and the incentive to great action the reduction of the public expenditure to the demand of a peace establishment will doubtless engage the immediate attention of congress there be however important consid eration which forbid a sudden and general revocation of the measure that have be produce by the war experience have teach that neither the pacific disposition of the american people nor the pacific character of political institution can altogether exempt from that strife which appear beyond the ordinary lot of nation to be incident to the ac tual period of the world and the same faithful monitor dem onstrate that a certain degree of preparation for war be not only indispensable to avert disaster in the onset but afford also the good security for the continuance of peace the wisdom of congress will therefore be confident provide for the maintenance of an adequate regular force for the gradual advancement of the naval establishment for improve all the mean of harbor defense for add discipline to the distin guishe bravery of the militia and for cultivate the military art in essential branch under the liberal patronage of government the resource of country be at all time competent to the attainment of every national object but will now be enrich and invigorate by the activity which peace will introduce into all the scene of domestic enterprise and labor the provision that have be make for the public creditor during the present session of congress must have a decisive effect in the establishment of the public credit both at home and abroad the revive interest of commerce will claim the legislative attention at the early opportunity and such reg ulation will trust be seasonably devise as shall secure to the|united|states just proportion of the navigation of the world the most liberal policy toward other nation if meet by correspond disposition will in this respect be find the most beneficial policy toward but there be no subject that can enter with great force and merit into the deliberation of congress than a consideration of the mean to preserve and promote the manufacture which have spring into existence and attain an unparalleled maturity throughout the|united|state during the period of the euro pean war this source of national independence and wealth anxiously recommend therefore to the prompt and constant guardianship of congress the termination of the legislative session will soon sepa rate fellow citizen from each other and restore to constituent pray to bear with the expression of sanguine hope that the peace which have be just declare will not only be the foundation of the most friendly intercourse between the|united|state and great|britain but that will also be productive of happiness and harmony in every section of beloved country the influence of precept and example must be every where powerful and while accord in grateful acknowledgment for the protec tion which providence have bestow upon let never cease to inculcate obedience to the law and fidelity to the union as constitute the palladium of the national independence and prosperity transcript to the senate of the|united|state have bestow on the bill entitle an act to incorporate the subscriber to the|bank|of|the|united|states|of|america that full consideration which be due to the great importance of the subject and dictate by the respect which feel for the houses|of|congress be constrain by a deep and solemn conviction that the bill ought not to become a law to return to the senate in which originate with objection to the same waive the question of the constitutional authority of the legislature to establish an incorporated bank as be preclude in judgment by repeat recognition under varied circumstance of the validity of such an institution in act of the legislative executive and judicial branch of the government accompany by indication in different mode of a concurrence of the general will of the nation the propose bank do not appear to be calculate to answer the purpose of revive the public credit of provide a national medium of circulation and of aid the treasury by facilitate the indispensable anticipation of the revenue and by afford to the public more durable loan the capital of the bank be to be compound of specie of public stock and of treasury note convertible into stock with a certain pro - portion of each of which every subscriber be to furnish the amount of the stock to be subscribe will not be believe be sufficient to produce in favor of the public credit any considerable or lasting elevation of the market price whilst this may be occasionally depress by the bank if should carry into the market the allow proportion of capital consist of public stock in order to procure specie which may find account in procure with some sacrifice on that part of capital nor will any adequate advantage arise to the public credit from the subscription of treasury note the actual issue of these note nearly equal at present and will soon exceed the amount to be subscribe to the bank the direct effect of this operation be simply to convert fifteen|million of treasury note into fifteen|million of per cent stock with the collateral effect of promote an additional demand for treasury note beyond what may otherwise be negotiable public credit may indeed be expect to derive advantage from the establishment of a national bank without regard to the formation of capital if the full aid and cooperation of the institution be secure to the government during the war and during the period of fiscal embarrassment but the bank propose will be free from all legal obligation to cooperate with the public measure and whatever may be the patriotic disposition of director to contribute to the removal of those embarrassment and to invigorate the prosecution of the war fidelity to the pecuniary and general interest of the institution accord to estimate of may oblige to decline a connection of operation with those of the|national|treasury during the continuance of the war and the difficulty incident to temporary sacrifice of interest though overbalance by the future and permanent profit of the charter not be requirable of right in behalf of the public may not be gratuitously make and the bank would reap the full benefit of the grant whilst the public would lose the equivalent expect from for must be keep in view that the sole inducement to such a grant on the part of the public would be the prospect of substantial aid to pecuniary mean at the present crisis and during the sequel of the war be evident that the stock of the bank will on the return of peace if not sooner rise in the market to a value which if the bank be establish in a period of peace would authorize and obtain for the public a bonus to a very large amount in lieu of such a bonus the government be fairly entitle to and ought not to relinquish or risk the needful service of the bank under the press circumstance of war the bank as propose to be constitute can not be rely on during the war to provide a circulate medium nor to furnish loan or antici pation of the public revenue without a medium the taxis can not be collect and in the absence of specie the medium understand to be the good substitute be that of note issue by a national bank the propose bank will commence and conduct operation under an obligation to pay note in specie or be subject to the loss of charter without such an obligation the note of the bank though not exchangeable for specie yet rest on good pledge and perform the us of specie in the payment of taxis and in other public transaction would as experience have ascertain qualify the bank to supply at once a circulate medium and pecuniary aid to the government under the fetter impose by the bill be manifest that during the actual state of thing and probably during the war the period particularly require such a medium and such a resource for loan and advance to the government note for which the bank would be compellable to give specie in exchange could not be keep in circulation the most the bank could effect and the most could be expect to aim at would be to keep the institution alive by limited and local transaction which with the interest on the public stock in the bank may yield a dividend sufficient for the purpose until a change from war to peace should enable by a flow of specie into vault and a removal of the external demand for to derive contemplated emolument from a safe and full extension of operation on the whole when be consider that the propose establishment will enjoy a monopoly of the profit of a national bank for a period of twenty|years that the monopolize profit will be continually grow with the progress of the national population and wealth that the nation will during the same period be dependent on the note of the bank for that specie of circulate medium whenever the precious metal may be want and at all time for so much thereof as may be an eligible substitute for a specie medium and that the extensive employment of the note in the collection of the augment taxis will moreover enable the bank greatly to extend profitable issue of without the expense of specie capital to support circulation be as reasonable as be requisite that the government in return for these extraordinary concession to the bank should have a great security for attain the public object of the institution than be present in the bill and particularly for every practicable accommodation both in the temporary advance necessary to anticipate the taxis and in those more durable loan which be equally necessary to diminish the resort to taxis in discharge this painful duty of state objection to a measure which have undergo the deliberation and receive the sanction of the houses of the|national|legislature console with the reflection that if have not the weight which attach to can be constitutionally overrule and with a confidence that in a contrary event the wisdom of congress will hasten to substitute a more commensurate and certain provision for the public exigency james|madison transcript of the|senate|&|of|the|house|of|representative notwithstanding the|early|day which have be fix for session of the|present|year be induce to call together still sooner as well that any inadequacy in the exist provision for the want of the treasury may be supply as that no delay may happen in provide for the result of the negotiation on foot with great|britain whether should require arrangement adapt to a return of peace or further and more effective provision for prosecute the war that result be not yet know if on the hand the repeal of the order in council and the general pacification in europe which withdraw the occasion on which impressment from

from usual practice of indiscriminate massacre on defenseless inhabitant or from scene of carnage without a parallel on prisoner to the british arm guard by all the law of humanity and of honorable war for these enormity the enemy be equally responsible whether with the power to prevent want the will or with the knowledge of a want of power still avail of such instrument in other respect the enemy be pursue a course which threaten consequence most afflict to humanity a stand law of great|britain naturalize as be well know all alien comply with condition limit to a short period than those require by the|united|state and naturalized subject be in war employ by government in common with native subject in a contiguous british|province regulation promulgate since the commencement of the war compel citizen of the|united|state be there under certain circumstance to bear arm whilst of the native emigrant from the|united|state who compose much of the population of the province a number have actually bear arm against the|united|state within limit some of whom after have do so have become prisoner of war and be now in possession the british commander in that province nevertheless with the sanction as appear of government think proper to select from american prisoner of war and send to great|britain for trial as criminal a # of individual who have emigrate from the british dominion long prior to the state of war between the nation who have incorporate into political society in the mode recognize by the law and the practice of great|britain and who be make prisoner of war under the banner of adopt country fight for right and safety the protection due to these citizen require an effectual interposition in behalf a like numver of british prisoner of war be put into confinement with a notification that would experience whatever violence may be commit on the american prisoner of war send to great|britain be hope that this necessary consequence of the step unadvisedly take on the part of great|britain would have lead government to reflect on the inconsistency of conduct and that a sympathy with the british if not with the american sufferer would have arrest the cruel career open by example this be unhappily not the case in violation both of consistency and of humanity american officer and non - commissioned officer in double the number of the british soldier confine here be order into close confinement with formal notice that in the event of a retaliation for the death which may be inflict on the prisoner of war send to great|britain for trial the officer

close confinement to abide the fate of those confine by the enemy and the|british|government be apprise of the determination of this government to retaliate any other proceeding against contrary to the legitimate mode of warfare be fortunate for the|united|state that have in power to meet the enemy in this deplorable contest as be honorable to that do not join in but under the most imperious obligation and with the humane purpose of effectuate a return to the establish usage of war the view of the|french|government on the subject which have be so long commit to negotiation have receive no elucidation since the close of late session the minister plenipotentiary of the|united|state at paris have not be enable by proper opportunity to press the object of mission as prescribe by instruction the militia be always to be regard as the great bulwark of defense and security for free state and the constitution have wisely commit to the national authority a use of that force as the good provision against an unsafe military establishment as well as a resource peculiarly adapt to a country have the extent and the exposure of the|united|state recommend to congress a revision of the militia law for the purpose of secure more effectually the service of all detachment call into the employment and place under the government of the|united|state will deserve the consideration of congress also whether among other improvement in the militia law justice do not require a regulation under due precaution for defray the expense incident to the 1st assemble as well as the subsequent movement of detachment call into the national service to give to vessel of war public and private the requisite advantage in cruise be of much importance that should have both for and prize the use of the port and market of friendly power with this view recommend to congress the expediency of such legal provision as may supply the defect or remove the doubt of the executive authority to allow to the cruiser of other power at war with enemy of such use of the american port as may correspond with the privilege allow by such power to american cruiser during the|year|ende on the|30|of|september last the receipt into the treasury have exceed m of which near m be the produce of loan after meet all demand for the public service there remain in the treasury on that|day near under the authority contain in the act of the|2nd|of|august last for borrow m that sum have be obtain on term more favorable to the|united|states than those of the precede loan make during the|present|year further sum to a considerable amount will be necessary to be obtain in the same way during the|ensuing|year and from the increase capital of the country from the fidelity with which the public engagement have be keep and the public credit maintain may be expect on good ground that the necessary pecuniary supply will not be want the expense of the|current|year from the multiply operation fall within have necessarily be extensive but on a just estimate of the campaign in which the mass of have be incur the cost will not be find disproportionate to the advantage which have be gain the campaign have indeed in latter stage in one|quarter be less favorable than be expect but in addition to the importance of naval success the progress of the campaign have be fill with incident highly honorable to the american arm the attack of the enemy on craney|island on fort|meig on sacketts|harbor and on sandusky have be vigorously and successfully repulse nor have in any case succeed on either frontier excepting when direct against the peaceable dwelling of individual or village unprepared or undefended on the other hand the movement of the|american|army have be follow by the reduction of york and of erie and malden by the recovery of detroit and the extinction of the indian war in the west and by the occupancy or command of a large portion of battle have also be fight on the border of the|st.|lawrence which though not accomplish entire object reflect honor on the discipline and prowess of soldiery the good augury of eventual victory in the same scale be to be place the late success in the south over of the most powerful which have become of the most hostile also of the indian tribe would be improper to close this communication without express a thankfulness in which all ought to unite for the abundance for the preservation of internal tranquillity and the stability of free institution and above all for the light of divine truth and the protection of every man 's conscience in the enjoyment of and although among blessing can not number an exemption from the evil of war yet these will never be regard as the great of evil by the friend of liberty and of the right of nation country have before prefer to the degraded condition which be the alternative when the sword be draw in the cause which give birth to national independence and none who contemplate the magnitude and feel the value of that glorious event will shrink from a struggle to maintain the high and happy ground on which place the american people with all good citizen the justice and necessity of resist wrong and usurpation no longer to be bear will sufficiently outweigh the privation and sacrifice inseparable from a state of war but be a reflection moreover peculiarly console that whilst war be generally aggravate by baneful effect on the internal improvement and permanent prosperity of the nation engage in such be the favor situation of the|united|state that the calamity of the contest into which have be compel to enter be mitigate by improvement and advantage of which the contest be the source if the war have increase the interruption of commerce have at the same time cherish and multiply manufacture so as to make independent of all other country for the more essential branch for which ought to be dependent on none and be even rapidly give an extent which will create additional staple in future intercourse with foreign market if much treasure have be expend no inconsiderable portion of have be apply to object durable in value and necessary to permanent safety if the war have expose to increase spoliation on the ocean and to predatory incursion on the land have develop the national mean of retaliate the former and of provide protection against the latter demonstrate to all that every blow aim at maritime independence be an impulse accelerate the growth of maritime power by diffuse through the mass of the nation the element of military discipline and instruction by augment and distribute warlike preparation applicable to future use by evince the zeal and valor with which will be employ and the cheerfulness with which every necessary burden will be bear a great respect for right and a long duration of future peace be promise than could be expect without these proof of the national character and resource the war have prove moreover that free government like other free government though slow in early movement acquire in progress a force proportion to freedom and that the union of these states the guardian of the freedom and safety of all and of each be strengthen by every occasion that put to the test in fine the war with all vicissitude be illustrate the capacity and the destiny of the|united|state to be a great a flourishing and a powerful nation worthy of the friendship which be dispose to cultivate with all other and authorize by own example to require from all an observance of the law of justice and reciprocity beyond these claim have never extend and in contend for these behold a subject for congratulation in the daily testimony of increase harmony throughout the nation and may humbly repose trust in the smile of heaven on so righteous a cause transcript whereas the congress of the|united|state by a joint resolution of the houses have signify a request that a day may be recommend to be observe by the people of the|united|state with religious solemnity as a day of public humiliation and prayer and whereas in time of public calamity such as that of the war bring on the|united|state by the injustice of a

the|house|of|representatives at an|early|day after the close of the last session of congress an offer be formally communicate from imperial majesty the emperor of russia of mediation as the common friend of the|united|state and great|britain for the purpose of facilitate a peace between the high character of the emperor alexander be a satisfactory pledge for the sincerity and impartiality of offer be immediately accept and as a further proof of the disposition on the part of the|united|state to meet adversary in honorable experiment for terminate the war be determine to avoid intermediate delay incident to the distance of the party by a definitive provision for the contemplated negotiation of eminent citizen be accordingly commission with the requisite power to conclude a treaty of peace with person clothe with like power on the part of great|britain be authorize also to enter into such conventional regulation of the commerce between the country as may be mutually advantageous the envoy who where in the|united|state at the time of appointment have proceed to join colleague already at st.|petersburg the envoy have receive another commission authorize to conclude with russia a treaty of commerce with a view to strengthen the amicable relation and improve the beneficial intercourse between the country the issue of this friendly interposition of the russian emperor and this pacific manifestation on the part of time only can decide that the sentiment of great|britain toward that sovereign will have produce an acceptance of offer mediation must be presume that no adequate motif exist to prefer a continuance of war with the|united|state to the term on which be willing to close be certain the british cabinet also must be sensible that with respect to the important question of impressment on which the war so essentially turn a search for or seizure of british person or property on board neutral vessel on the high sea be not a belligerent right derive from the law of nation and be obvious that no visit or search or use of force for any purpose on board the vessel of independent power on the high sea can in war or peace be sanction by the law or authority of another power be equally obvious that for the purpose of preserve to each state seafaring member by exclude from the vessel of the other the mode heretofore propose by the|united|state and now enact by as an article of municipal policy can not for a moment be compare with the mode practice by great|britain without a conviction of title to preference inasmuch as the latter leave the discrimination between the mariner of the nation to officer expose by unavoidable bias as well as by a defect of evidence to a wrong decision under circumstance preclude for the most part the enforcement of control penalty and where a wrong decision besides the irreparable violation of the sacred right of person may frustrate the plan and profit of entire voyage whereas the mode assume by the|united|state guard with study fairness and efficacy against error in such case and avoid the effect of casual error on the safety of navigation and the success of mercantile expedition if the reasonableness of expectation draw from these consideration could guarantee fulfillment a just peace would not be distant but become the wisdom of the|national|legislature to keep in mind the true policy or rather the indispensable obligation of adapt measure to the supposition that the only course to that happy event be in the vigorous employment of the resource of war and painful as the reflection be this duty be particularly enforce by the spirit and manner in which the war continue to be wag by the enemy who uninfluence by the unvaried example of humanity set be add to the savage fury of on frontier a system of plunder and conflagration on the other equally forbid by respect for national character and by the establish rule of civilized warfare as an encouragement to persevere and invigorate exertion to bring the contest to a happy result have the satisfaction of be able to appeal to the auspicious progress of arm both by land and on the water in continuation of the brilliant achievement of infant navy a signal triumph have be gain by captain lawrence and companion in the hornet sloop of war which destroy a british sloop of war with a celerity so unexampled and with a slaughter of the enemy so disproportionate to the loss in the hornet as to claim for the conqueror the high praise and the full recompense provide by congress in precede case public ship of war in general as well as the private armed vessel have continue also activity and success against the commerce of the enemy and by vigilance and address have greatly frustrate the effort of the hostile squadron distribute along coast to intercept in return into port and resume cruise the augmentation of naval force as authorize at the last session of congress be in progress on the lakes superiority be near at hand where be not already establish the event of the campaign so far as be know to furnish matter of congratulation and show that under a wise organization and efficient direction the army be destine to a glory not less brilliant than that which already encircle the navy the attack and capture of york be in that|quarter a presage of future and great victory while on the western frontier the issue of the late

that of great|britain the advance be decline from an avowed repugnance to a suspension of the practice of impressment during the armistice and without any intimation that the arrangement propose wrt sea man would be accept whether the subsequent communication from this government afford an occasion for reconsider the subject on the part of great|britain will be view in a more favorable light or

the indian tribe not under foreign instigation remain at peace and receive the civilizing attention which have prove so beneficial to with a view to that vigorous prosecution of the war to which national faculty be adequate the attention of congress will be particularly draw to the insufficiency of exist provision for fill up the military establishment such be the happy condition of country arise from the facility of subsistence and the high wage for every specie of occupation that notwithstanding the augment inducement provide at the last session a partial success only have attend the recruiting service the deficiency have be necessarily supply during the campaign by other than regular troop with all the inconvenience and expense incident to the remedy lie in establish more favorably for the private soldier the proportion between recompense and the term of enlistment and be a subject which can not too soon or too seriously be take into consideration the same insufficiency have be experience in the provision for volunteer make by an act of the last session the recompense for the service require in this case be still less attractive than in the other and although patriotism alone have send into the field some valuable corps of that description those alone who can afford the sacrifice can be reasonably expect to yield to that impulse will merit consideration also whether as auxiliary to the security of frontier corps may not be advantageously organize with a restriction of service to particular district convenient to and whether the local and occasional service of mariner and other in the sea port town under a similar organization would not be a provident addition to the mean of defense recommend a provision for an increase of the general officer of the army the deficiency of which have be illustrate by the # |and|distance of separate command which the course of the war and the advantage of the service have require and can not

a degradation blast good and proud hope would have strike from the high rank where the virtuous struggle of father have place and have betray the magnificent legacy which hold in trust for future generation would have acknowledge that on the element which form fourth of the globe inhabit and where all independent nation have equal and common right the american people be not an independent people but colonist and vassal be at this moment and with such an alternative that war be choose the nation feel the necessity of and call for the appeal be accordingly make in a just cause to the

house|of|representatif of the|united|state communicate to congress certain document be a continuation of those heretofore lay before on the subject of affair with great|britain without go back beyond the renewal in of the war in which great|britain be engage and omit unrepaired wrong of inferior magnitude the conduct of government present a series of act hostile to the|united|state as an independent and neutral nation british cruiser have be in the continued practice of violate the american flag on the great highway of nation and of seize and carry off person sail under not in the exercise of a belligerent right found on the law of nation against an enemy but of a municipal prerogative over british subject british jurisdiction be thus extend to neutral vessel in a situation where no law can operate but the law of nation and the law of the country to which the vessel belong and a self redress be assume which if british subject be wrongfully detain and alone concerned be that substitution of force for a resort to the responsible sovereign which fall within the definition of war could the seizure of british subject in such case be regard as within the exercise of a belligerent right the acknowledge law of war which forbid an article of capture property to be adjudge without a regular investigation before a competent tribunal would imperiously demand the fair trial where the sacred right of person be at issue in place of such a trial these right be subject to the will of every petty commander the practice hence be so far from affect british subject alone that under the pretext of search for these thousand of american citizen under the safeguard of public law and of national flag have be tear from country and from everything dear to have be drag on board ship of war of a foreign nation and expose under the severity of discipline to be exile to the most distant and deadly clime to risk life in the battle of oppressor and to be the melancholy instrument of take away those of own brother against this cry enormity which great|britain would be so prompt to avenge if commit against the|united|state have in vain exhausted remonstrance and expostulation and that no proof may be want of conciliatory disposition and no pretext leave for a continuance of the practice the british government be formally assure of the readiness of the|united|state to enter into arrangement such as could not be reject if the recovery of british subject be the real and the sole object the communication pass without effect british cruiser have be in the practice also of violate the right and the peace of coast hover over and harass enter and depart commerce to the most insulting pretension have add the most lawless proceeding in very harbor and have wantonly spill american blood within the sanctuary of territorial jurisdiction the principle and rule enforce by that nation when a neutral nation against armed vessel of belligerent hover near coast and disturb commerce be well know when call on nevertheless by the|united|state to punish the great offense commit by own vessel government have bestow on commander additional mark of honor and confidence under pretend blockade without the presence of an adequate force and sometimes without the practicability of apply commerce have be plunder in every sea the great staple of country have be cut off from legitimate market and a destructive blow aim at agricultural and maritime interest in aggravation of these predatory measure have be consider as in force from the date of notification a retrospective effect be thus add as have be do in other important case to the unlawfulness of the course pursue and to render the outrage the more signal these mock blockade have be reiterate and enforce in the face of official communication from the british government declare as the true definition of a legal blockade that particular port must be actually invest and previous warning give to vessel bind to not to enter not content with these occasional expedient for lay waste neutral trade the cabinet of britain resort at length to the sweeping system of blockade under the name of order in council which have be mold and manage as may best suit political view commercial jealousy or the avidity of british cruiser to remonstrance against the complicated and transcendent injustice of this innovation the first reply be that the order be reluctantly adopt by great|britain as a necessary retaliation on decree of enemy proclaim a general blockade of the|british|isle at a time when the naval force of that enemy dare not issue from own port be remind without effect that own prior blockade unsupported by an adequate naval force actually apply and continue be a bar to this plea that execute edict against million of property could not be retaliation on edict confessedly impossible to be execute that retaliation to be just should fall on the party set the guilty example not on an innocent party which be not even chargeable with an acquiescence in when deprive of this flimsy veil for a prohibition of trade with enemy by the repeal of prohibition of trade with great|britain cabinet instead of a corresponding repeal or a practical discontinuance of order formally avow a determination to persist in against the|united|state until the market of enemy should be lay open to british product thus assert an obligation on a neutral power to require belligerent to encourage by internal regulation the trade of another belligerent contradict own practice toward all nation in peace as well as in war and betray the insincerity of those profession which inculcate a belief that have resort to order with regret be anxious to find an occasion for put an end to abandon still more all respect for the neutral right of the|united|state and for own consistency the british government now demand as prerequisite to a repeal of order as relate to the|united|state that a formality should be observe in the repeal of the french decree nowise necessary to termination nor exemplify by british usage and that the french repeal besides include that portion of the decree which operate within a territorial jurisdiction as well as that which operate on the high sea against the commerce of the|united|state should not be a single and special repeal in relation to the|united|state but should be extend to whatever other neutral nation unconnected with may be affect by those decree and as an additional insult be call on for a formal disavowal of condition and pretension advance by the french government for which the|united|state be so far from have make responsible that in official explanation which have be publish to the world and in a correspondence of the american minister at london with the british minister for foreign affair such a responsibility be explicitly and emphatically disclaim have become indeed sufficiently certain that the commerce of the|united|state be to be sacrifice not as interfere with the belligerent right of great|britain not as supply the want of enemy which supply but as interfere with the monopoly which covet for own commerce and navigation carry on a war against the lawful commerce of a friend that may the well carry on a commerce with an enemy a commerce pollute by the forgery and perjury which be for the most part the only passport by which can succeed anxious to make every experiment short of the last resort of injure nation the|united|state have withhold from great|britain under successive modification the benefit of a free intercourse with market the loss of which could not but outweigh the profit accrue from restriction of commerce with other nation and to entitle these experiment to the more favorable consideration be so frame as to enable to place adversary under the exclusive operation of to these appeal government have be equally inflexible as if willing to make sacrifice of every sort rather than yield to the claim of justice or renounce the error of a false pride nay so far be the attempt carry to overcome the attachment of the british cabinet to unjust edict that receive every encouragement within the competency of the executive branch of government to expect that a repeal of would be follow by a war between the|united|state and france unless the french edict should also be repeal even this communication although silence forever the plea of a disposition in the|united|state to acquiesce in those edict originally the sole plea for receive no attention if no other proof exist of a predetermination of the british government against a repeal of order may be find in the correspondence of the minister plenipotentiary of the|united|state at london and the british secretary for foreign affair in on the question whether the blockade of may,|1806 be consider as in force or as not in force have be ascertain that the french government which urge this blockade as the ground of berlin decree be willing in the event of removal to repeal that decree which be follow by alternate repeal of the other offensive edict may abolish the whole system on both side this invite opportunity for accomplish an object so important to the|united|state and profess so often to be the desire of both the belligerent be make known to the british government as that government admit that an actual application of an adequate force be necessary to the existence of a legal blockade and be notorious that if such a force have ever be apply long discontinuance have annul the blockade in question there could be no sufficient objection on the part of great|britain to a formal revocation of and no imaginable objection to a declaration of the fact that the blockade do not exist the declaration would have be consistent with avowed principle of blockade and would have enable the|united|state to demand from france the pledge repeal of decree either with success in which case the way would have be open for a general repeal of the belligerent edict or without success in which case the|united|state would have be justify in turn measure exclusively against france the british government would however neither rescind the blockade nor declare nonexistence nor permit non - existence to be infer and affirm by the american plenipotentiary on the contrary by represent the blockade to be comprehend in the order in council the|united|state be compel so to regard in subsequent proceeding there be a period when a favorable change in the policy of the british cabinet be

vanish the whole proceeding be disavow by the british government without any explanation which could at that time repress the belief that the disavowal proceed from a spirit of hostility to the commercial right and prosperity of the|united|state and have since come into proof that at the very moment when the public minister be hold the language of friendship and inspire confidence in the

of great|britain toward the|united|stat attention be necessarily draw to the warfare just renew by the savage on of extensive frontier a warfare which be know to spare neither age nor sex and to be

trader and garrison without connect hostility with that influence and without recollect the authenticate example of such interposition heretofore furnish by the officer and agent of that government such be the spectacle of injury and indignity which have be heap on country and such the crisis which unexampled forbearance and conciliatory effort have not be able to avert may at least have be expect that an enlighten nation if less urge by moral obligation or invite by friendly disposition on the part of the|united|state would have find true interest alone a sufficient motive to respect right and tranquillity on the high sea that an enlarged policy would have favor that free and general circulation of commerce in which the british nation be at all time interested and which in time of war be the good alleviation of calamity to as well as to other belligerent and more especially that the british cabinet would not for the sake of a precarious and surreptitious intercourse with hostile market have persevere in a course of measure which necessarily put at hazard the invaluable market of a great and grow country dispose to cultivate the mutual advantage of an active commerce other counsel have prevail moderation and conciliation have have no other effect than to encourage perseverance and to enlarge pretension behold seafaring citizen still the daily victim of lawless

of proceed to remark that the communica tion last make to congress on the subject of relation with france will have shew that since the revocation of decree as violate the neutral right of

the present for the time of meeting regard be have to the probability of further development of the policy of the belligerent power toward this country which may the more unite the national council in the measure to be pursue at the close of the last session of congress be hope that the successive confirmation of the extinction of the french decree so far as violate neutral commerce would have induce the government of great britain to repeal order in council and thereby authorize a removal of the exist obstruction to commerce with the|united|state instead of this reasonable step toward satisfaction and friendship between the nation the order be at a moment when least to have be expect put into more rigorous execution and be communicate through the british envoy just arrive that

communication appear not to have be receive but the transmission of hither instead of found on an actual repeal of the order or assurance that the repeal would ensue will not permit to rely on any

in council and to both the correspondence relate to the floridas in which congress will be make acquaint with the interposition which the government of great britain have think proper to make against the proceeding of the|united|state the justice and fairness which have be evince on the part of the|united|state toward france both before and since the revocation of decree authorize an expectation that government would have follow up that measure by all such other as be due to reasonable claim as well s dictate by amicable profession no proof however be yet give of an intention to repair the other wrong do to the|united|state and particularly to restore the great amount of american property seize and condemn under edict which though not affect neutral relation and therefore not enter into question between the|united|state and other belligerent be nevertheless found in such unjust principle that the reparation ought to have be prompt and ample in addition to this and other demand of strict right on that nation have much reason to be dissatisfy with the rigorous and unexpected restriction to which trade with the french dominion have be subject and which if not discontinue will require at least corresponding restriction on importation from france into the|united|state on all those subject minister plenipotentiary lately send to paris have carry with the necessary instruction the result of which will be communicate to by ascertain the ulterior policy of the|french|government toward the|united|state will enable to adapt to that of the|united|state toward france other

more than a recompense for those privation and loss result from foreign injustice which furnish the general impulse require for accomplishment how far may be expedient to guard the infancy of this improvement in the distribution of labor by regulation of the commercial tariff be a subject which can not fail to suggest to patriotic reflection will rest with the consideration of congress also whether a provident as well as fair encouragement would not be give to navigation by such regulation as would place on a level of competition with foreign vessel particularly in transport the important and bulky production of own soil the failure of equality and reciprocity in the exist regulation on this subject operate in port as a premium to foreign competitor and the inconvenience must

contribute not less to strengthen the foundation than to adorn the structure of free and happy system of government among the commercial abuse still commit under the american flag and leave in force former reference to that subject appear that american citizen be instrumental in carry on a traffic in enslave africans equally in violation of the law of humanity and in defiance of those of own country the same just and benevolent motif which produce interdiction in force against this criminal conduct will doubtless be feel by congress in devise further mean of suppress the evil in the midst of uncertainty necessarily connect with the great interest of the|united|state prudence require a continuance of defensive and precautionary arrangement the secretary of war and secretary of the navy

naval expenditure and in the ground on which be make the fortification for the defense of maritime frontier have be prosecute accord to the plan lay down in the work with some exception be complete and furnish with ordnance those for the security of the city of new|york though far advanced toward completion will require a further time and appropriation this be the case with a few other either not complete or in need of repair the improvement in quality and quantity make in the manufacture of cannon and small arm both at the public armory and private factory warrant additional confidence in the competency of these resource for supply the public exigency these preparation for arm the militia have thus far provide for of the object contemplate by the power vest in congress with respect to that great bulwark of the public safety be for consideration whether further provision be not requisite for the other contemplated object of organization and discipline to give to this great mass of physical and moral force the efficiency which merit and be capable of receive be indispensable that should be instruct and practice in the rule by which be to be govern toward an accomplishment of this important work recommend for the consideration of congress the expediency of institute a system which shall in the first instance call into the field at the public expense and for a give time certain portion of the commission and non - commissioned officer the instruction and discipline thus acquire would gradually diffuse through the entire body of the militia that practical knowledge and promptitude for active service which be the great end to be pursue experience have leave no doubt either of the necessity or of the efficacy of competent military skill in those portion of an army in fit for the final duty which may have to perform the|corps|of|engineer with the|military|academy be entitle to the early attention of congress the building at the seat fix by law for the present academy be so far in decay as not to afford the necessary accommodation but a revision of the law be recommend principally with a view to a more enlarged cultivation and diffusion of the advantage of such institution by provide professorship for all the necessary branch of military instruction and by the establishment of an additional academy at the seat of government or elsewhere the mean by which war as well for defense as for offense be now carry on render these school of the more scientific operation an indispensable part of every adequate system even among nation whose large stand army and frequent war afford every other opportunity of instruction these establishment be find to be indispensable for the due attainment of the branch of military science which require a regular

the|ensuing|year reserve for future occasion in the course of the session whatever other communication may claim attention close the present by express reliance under the blessing of divine|providence on the judgement and patriotism which will guide measure at a period particularly call for united council and flexible exertion for the welfare of country and by assure of the fidelity and alacrity with which cooperation will be afford transcript whereas the territory south of the|mississippi|territory and eastward of the river mississippi and extend to the river perdido of which possession be

convey by the say treaty in the same extent that have in the hand of spain and that have when france originally possess and whereas the acquiescence of the|united|state in the temporary continuance of the say territory under the spanish authority be not the result of any distrust of title as have be particularly evince by the general tenor of law and by the distinction make in the application of those law between that territory and foreign country but be occasion by conciliatory view and by a confidence in the justice of cause and in the success of candid discussion and amicable negotiation with a just and friendly power and whereas a satisfactory adjustment too long delay without the fault of the|united|state have for some time be entirely suspend by event over which have no control and whereas a crisis have at length arrive subversive of the order of thing under the spanish authority whereby a failure of the|united|state to take the say territory into possession may lead to event ultimately contravene the view of both party whilst in the meantime the tranquillity and security of adjoin territory be endanger and new facility give to violation of revenue and commercial law and of those prohibit the introduction of slave considering moreover that under these peculiar and imperative circumstance a forbearance on the part of the|united|state to occupy the territory in question and thereby guard against the confusion and contingency which threaten may be construe into a dereliction of title or an insensibility to the importance of the stake consider that in the hand of the|united|state will not cease to be a subject of fair and friendly negotiation and adjustment consider finally that the act of congress though contemplate a present possession by a foreign authority have contemplate also an eventual possession of the say territory by the|united|state and be accordingly so frame as in that case to extend in operation to the same now be know that james|madison president of the|united|states|of|america in pursuance of these weighty and urgent consideration have deem right and requisite that possession should be take of the say territory in the name and behalf of the|united|state william|c.|c.|claiborne governor of of which the say territory be to be take as part will accordingly proceed to execute the same and to exercise over the say territory the authority and function legally appertain to office and the good people inhabit the same be invite and enjoin to pay due respect to in that character to be obedient to the law to maintain order to cherish harmony and in every manner to conduct as peaceable citizen under full assurance that will be protect in the enjoyment of liberty property and religion in testimony whereof have cause the seal

james|madison by the president r.|smith secretary of state transcript of the senate and of the|house|of|representatives at the period of last meeting have the satisfaction of communicate an adjustment with of the principal belligerent nation highly important in and still more so as presage a more extended accommodation be with deep concern be now to inform that the favorable prospect have be over clouded by a refusal of the|british|government to abide by the act of minister plenipotentiary and by ensue policy toward the|united|state as see through the communication of the minister send to replace whatever plea may be urge for a disavowal of engagement form by diplomatic functionary in case where by the term of the engagement a mutual ratification be reserve or where notice at the time may have be give of a departure from instruction or in extraordinary case essentially violate the principle of equity a disavowal could not have be apprehend in a case where no such notice or violation exist where no such ratification be reserve and more especially where as be now in proof an engagement to be execute without any such ratification be contemplate by the instruction give and where have with good faith be carry into immediate execution on the part of the|united|state these consideration not have restrain the|british|government from disavow the arrangement by virtue of which order in council be to be revoke and the event authorize the renewal of commercial intercourse have thus not take place necessarily become a question of equal urgency and importance whether the act prohibit that intercourse be not to be consider as remain in legal force this question be after due deliberation determine in the affirmative a proclamation to that effect be issue could not but happen however that a return to this state of thing from that which have follow an execution of the arrangement by the|united|state would involve difficulty with a view to diminish these as much as possible the instruction from the secretary of the treasury now lay before be transmit to the collector of the several port if in permit british vessel to depart without give bond not to proceed to own port should appear that the tenor of legal authority have not be strictly pursue be to be ascribe to the anxious desire which be feel that no individual should be injure by so unforeseen an occurrence and rely on the regard of congress for the equitable interest of own citizen to adopt whatever further provision may be find requisite for a general remission of penalty involuntarily incur the recall of the disavow minister have be follow by the appointment of a successor hope be indulge that the new mission would contribute to alleviate the disappointment which have be produce and to remove the cause which have so long embarrass the good understanding of the nation could not be doubt that would at least be charge with conciliatory explanation of the step which have be take and with proposal to be substitute for the reject arrangement reasonable and universal as this expectation be also have not be fulfil from the first official disclosure of the new minister be find that have receive no authority to enter into explanation relative to either branch of the arrangement disavow nor any authority to substitute proposal as to that branch which concern the british order in council and finally that proposal wrt the other branch the attack on the frigate chesapeake be found on a presumption repeatedly declare to be inadmissible by the|united|state that the first step

resolution of the 5th instant proceed to give such information as be possess of the effect of gun boat in the protection and defense of harbor of the number think necessary and of the propose distribution of among the port and harbor of the|united|state under the present circumstance and govern by the intention of the legislature as manifest by annual appropriation of money for the purpose of defence have be conclude to combine 1st land battery furnish with heavy cannon and mortar and establish on all the point around the place favorable for prevent vessel from lie before movable artillery which may be carry as an occasion may require to point unprovide with fix battery float battery and 4th gun boat which may oppose an enemy at entrance and co - operate with the battery for expulsion on this subject professional man be consult as far as have opportunity general wilkinson and the late general gates give opinion in writing in favor of the system as will be see by letter now communicate the high officer of the navy give the same opinion in separate conference as presence at the seat of government offer occasion of consult and no difference of judgment appear on the subject those of commodore barron and captain tingey now here be recently furnish in writing and transmit herewith to the legislature the efficacy of gun boat for the defence of harbor and of other smooth and enclosed water may be estimate in part from that of galley formerly much use but less powerful more costly in construction and maintenance and require more man but the gun boat be believe to be in use with every modern maritime nation for the purpose of defence in the mediterranean on which be several small power whose system like be peace and defence few harbor be without this article of protection own experience there of the effect of gun boat for harbor service be recent algiers be particularly know to have owe to a great provision of these vessel the safety of city since the epoch of construction before that have be repeatedly insult and injure the effect of gun boat at present in the neighborhood of gibraltar be well know and how much be use both in the attack and defence of that place during a former war the extensive resort to by the great naval power in the world on an enterprise of invasion not long since in prospect show confidence in efficacy for the purpose for which be suit by the northern power of europe whose sea be particularly adapt to be still more used the remarkable action between the russian flotilla of gun boat and galley and a turkish fleet of ship of the line and frigate in the liman sea will be readily recollect the latter command by most celebrated admiral be completely defeat and several of ship of the line destroy from the opinion give as to the number of gun boat necessary for some of the principal seaport and from a view of all the town and port from orleans to maine inclusive entitle to protection in proportion to situation and circumstance be conclude that to give a due measure of protection in time of war about|two|hundr gun boat will be requisite accord to first idea the follow would be general distribution liable to be vary on more mature examination and as circumstance shall vary that be to say to the mississippi and neighboring water gun boat to savannah and charleston and the harbor on each side from 's to currituck to the chesapeake and water to delaware bay and river to new|york the sound and water as far as cape|cod to boston and the harbor north of cape|cod the flotilla assign to these several station may each be under the care of a particular commandant and the vessel compose would in ordinary be distribute among the harbor within the station in proportion to importance of these boat a proper proportion would be of the large size such as those heretofore build capable of navigate any sea and of reinforce occasionally the strength of even the most distant port when menace with danger the residue would be confine to own or the neighboring harbor would be small less furnished for accommodation and consequently less costly of the number suppose necessary be build or building and the|hundred|and|twenty still to be provide would cost from five|to|six|hundred|thousand|dollars have regard to the convenience of the treasury as well as to the resource of building have be think that one|half of these may be build in the|present|year and the other half the next with the legislature however will rest to stop where be or at any further point when shall be of opinion that the number provide shall be sufficient for the object at time when europe as well as the|united|state shall be at peace would not be propose that or of these vessel should be keep afloat when europe be in war treble that number may be necessary to be distribute among those particular harbor which foreign vessel of war be in the habit of frequenting for the purpose of preserve order therein but would be man in ordinary with only complement for navigation rely on the seamen and militia of the port if call into action on sudden emergency would be only when the|united|states should be at war that the whole number would be bring into actual service and would be ready in the first moment of the war to co - operate with other mean for cover at once the line of seaport at all time those unemployed would be withdraw into place not expose to sudden enterprise haul up under shed from the sun and weather and keep in preservation with little expense for repair or maintenance must be superfluous to observe that this species of naval armament be propose merely for defensive operation that can have but little effect toward protect commerce in the open sea even on coast and still less can become an excitement to engage in offensive maritime war toward which would furnish no mean transcript to the senate and house|of representative of the united state agreeably to the request of the|house|of|representatives communicate in resolution of the 16th instant proceed to state under the reserve therein express information receive touch an illegal combination of private individual against the peace and safety of the union and a military expedition plan by against the territory of a power in amity with the|united|state with the measure have pursue for suppress the same have for some time be in the constant expectation of receive such further information as would have enable to lay before the legislature the termination as well as the beginning and progress of this scene of depravity so far have be act on the ohio and water from this the state and safety of the low country may have be estimate on probable ground and the delay be indulge the rather because no circumstance have yet make necessary to call in the aid of the legislative function information now recently communicate have bring nearly to the period contemplate the mass of what have receive in the course of these transaction be voluminous but little have be give under the sanction of an oath so as to constitute formal and legal evidence be chiefly in the form of letter often contain such a mixture of rumor conjecture and suspicion as render difficult to sift out the real fact and unadvisable to hazard more than general outline strengthen by concurrent information or the particular credibility of the relater in this state of the evidence deliver sometimes too under the restriction of private confidence neither safety nor justice will permit the expose name except that of the principal actor whose guilt be place beyond question some time in the latter part of september receive intimation that design be in agitation in the western country unlawful and unfriendly to the peace of the union and that the prime mover in these be aaron|burr heretofore distinguish by the favor of country the ground of these intimation be inconclusive the object uncertain and the fidelity of that country know to be firm the only measure take be to urge the informant to use good endeavor to get further insight into the design and proceeding of the suspect person and to communicate to be not until the latter part of october that the object of the conspiracy begin to be perceive but still so blended and involve in mystery that nothing distinct could be single out for pursuit in this state of uncertainty as to the crime contemplate the act do and the legal course to be pursue think best to send to the scene where these thing be principally in transaction a person in whose integrity understanding and discretion entire confidence could be repose with instruction to investigate the plot go on to enter into conference for which have sufficient credential with the governor and all other officer civil and military and with aid to do on the spot whatever should be necessary to discover the design of the conspirator arrest mean bring person to punishment and to call out the force of the country to suppress any unlawful enterprise in which should be find be engage by this time be know that many boat be under preparation store of provision collect and an unusual number of suspicious character in motion on the ohio and water besides despatch the confidential agent to that|quarter order be at the same time send to the governor of the orleans and mississippi territory and to the commander of the land and naval force there to be on guard against surprise and in constant readiness to resist any enterprise which may be attempt on the vessel post or other object under care and on the|8th|of|november instruction be forward to general|wilkinson to hasten an accommodation with the spanish commander on the sabine and as soon as that be effect to fall back with principal force to the hither bank of the mississippi for the defence of the intersect point on that river by a letter receive from that officer on the|25th|of|november but date october|21st learn that a confidential agent of aaron|burr have be depute to with communication partly write in cipher and partly oral explain design exaggerate resource and make such offer of emolument and command to engage and the army in unlawful enterprise as have flatter would be successful the general with the honor of a soldier and fidelity of a good citizen immediately despatch a trusty officer to with information of what have pass proceed to establish such an understanding with the spanish commandant on the sabine as permit to withdraw force across the mississippi and to enter on measure for oppose the project enterprise the general 's letter which come to hand on the|25th|of|november as have be mention and some other information receive a|few|days|earlier when bring together develop burr 's general design different part of which only have be reveal to different informant appear that contemplate distinct object which may be carry on either jointly or separately and either the one or the other first as circumstance should direct of these be the severance of the|union|of|these|state by the alleghany mountain the other an attack on mexico a third object be provide merely ostensible to wit the settlement of a pretend purchase of a tract of country on the washita claim by a|baron|bastrop this be to serve as the pretext for all preparation an allurement for such follower as really wish to acquire settlement in that country and a cover under which to retreat in the event of final discomfiture of both branch of real design find at once that the attachment of the western country to the present union be not to be shake that dissolution could not be effect with the consent of inhabitant and that resource be inadequate as yet to effect by force take course then at once determine to seize on new|orleans plunder the bank there possess of the military and naval store and proceed on expedition to mexico and to this object all mean and preparation be now direct collect from all|the|quarter where or agent possess influence all the ardent restless desperate and disaffect person who be ready for any enterprise analogous to character seduce good and well mean citizen some by assurance that possess the confidence of the government and be act under secret patronage a pretence which obtain some credit from the state of difference with spain and other by offer of land in bastrop 's claim on the washita this be the state of information of proceeding about|the|last|of|november at which time therefore be first possible to take specific measure to meet the proclamation of november|27 two|day after the receipt of general|wilkinson 's information be now issue order be despatch to every intersecting point on the ohio and mississippi from pittsburg to new|orleans for the employment of such force either of the regular or of the militia and of such proceeding also of the civil authority as may enable to seize on all the boat and store provide for the enterprise to arrest the person concern and to suppress effectually the further progress of the enterprise a little before the receipt of these order in the|state of ohio confidential agent who have be diligently employ in investigate the conspiracy have acquire sufficient information to open to the governor of that state and apply for the immediate exertion of the authority and power of the state to crush the combination governor tiffin and the legislature with a promptitude an energy and patriotic zeal which entitle to a distinguished place in the affection of sister states effect the seizure of all the boat provision and other preparation within reach and thus give a first blow materially disable the enterprise in outset in kentucky a premature attempt to bring burr to justice without sufficient evidence for conviction have produce a popular impression in favor and a general disbelief of guilt this give an unfortunate opportunity of hasten equipment the arrival of the proclamation and order and the application and information of confidential agent at length awaken the authority of that state to the truth and then produce the same promptitude and energy of which the neighboring state have set the example under an act of legislature of december|23 militia be instantly order to different important point and measure take for do whatever could yet be do some boat account vary from to double or treble that number and person differently estimate from one|to|three|hundred have in the meantime pass the fall of the ohio to rendezvous at the mouth of the cumberland with other expect down that river not apprized till very late that any boat be build on cumberland the effect of the proclamation have be trust to for some time in the|state of tennessee but on the|19th|of|december similar communication and instruction with those of the neighboring states be despatch by express to the governor and a general officer of the western division of the state and on the|23rd|of|december confidential agent leave frankfort for nashville to put into activity the mean of that state also but by information receive yesterday learn that on the|22rd|of|december mr. burr descend the cumberland with boat merely of accommodation carry with from that state no quota toward unlawful enterprise whether after the arrival of the proclamation of the order or of agent any exertion which could be make by that state or the order of the governor of kentucky for call out the militia at the mouth of cumberland would be in time to arrest these boat and those from the fall of the ohio be still doubtful on the whole the fugitive from ohio with associate from cumberland or any other place in that|quarter can not threaten serious danger to the city of by the same express of december|nineteenth order be send to the governor of new|orleans and mississippi supplementary to those which have be give on the|25th|of|november to hold the militia of territory in readiness to co - operate for defence with the regular troop and armed vessel then under command of general|wilkinson great alarm indeed be excite at new|orlean by the exaggerated account of mr. burr disseminate through emissary of the army and navy be to assemble there general wilkinson have arrive there on the|24th|of|november and have immediately put into activity the resource of the place for the purpose of defence and on the|tenth|of|december be join by troop from the sabine great zeal be show by the inhabitant generally the merchant of the place readily agree to the most laudable exertion and sacrifice for man the armed vessel with seaman and the other citizen manifest unequivocal fidelity to the union and a spirit of determine resistance to expect assailant surmise have be hazard that this enterprise be to receive aid from certain foreign power but these surmise be without proof or probability the wisdom of the measure sanction by congress at last session have place in the path of peace and justice with the only power with whom have any difference and nothing have happen since which make either interest or our to pursue another course no change of measure have take place on part none ought to take place at this time with the friendly arrangement be then propose and the law deem necessary on the failure of that be suspend to give time for a fair trial of the issue with the same power negotiation be still preferred and provisional measure only be necessary to meet the event of rupture while therefore do not deflect in the slight degree from the course then assume and be still pursue with mutual consent to restore a good understanding be not to impute to practice as irreconcilable to interest as to good faith and change necessarily the relation of peace and justice between to those of war these surmise be therefore to be impute to the vaunting of the author of this enterprise to multiply partisan by magnify the belief of prospect and support by letter from general|wilkinson of the|14th|and|18th|of|september which come to hand two|day after date of the resolution of the|house|of|representatives that be to say on the|morning of the 18th instant receive the important affidavit a copy of which now communicate with extract of so much of the letter as come within the scope of the resolution by these will be see that of of the principal emissary of mr. burr whom the general have cause to be apprehend one have be liberate by habeas corpus and the other be those particularly employ in the endeavor to corrupt the general and army of the|united|state have be embark by for port in the|atlantic|state probably on the consideration that an impartial trial could not be expect during the present agitation of new|orleans and that that city be not as yet a safe place of confinement as soon as these person shall arrive will be deliver to the custody of the law and leave to such course of trial both as to place and process as functionary may direct the presence of the high judicial authority to be assemble at this place within a|few|day the mean of pursue a sounder course of proceeding here than elsewhere and the aid of the executive mean should the

those measure which be most likely to bring to such a termination by special mission charge with such power and instruction as in the event of failure could leave no imputation on either moderation or forbearance the delay which have since take place in negotiation with the british government appear to have proceed from cause which do not forbid the expectation that during the course of the session may be enable to lay before final issue what will be that of the negotiation for settle difference with spain nothing which have take place at the date of the last despatch enable to pronounce on the western side of the mississippi advance in considerable force and take post at the settlement of bayou|pierre on the red river this village be originally settle by france be hold by as long as hold louisiana and be deliver to spain only as a part of louisiana be small insulate and distant be not observe at the moment of redelivery to france and the|united|state that continue a guard of man which have be station there a proposition however have be lately make by commander in chief to assume the sabine river as a temporary line of separation between the troop of the nation until the issue of negotiation shall be know this have be refer by the spanish commandant to superior and in the meantime have withdraw force to the western side of the sabine river the correspondence on this subject now communicate will exhibit more particularly the present state of thing in that|quarter the nature of that country require indispensably that an unusual proportion of the force employ there should be cavalry or mount infantry in order therefore that the command officer may be enable to act with effect have authorize to call on the governor of orleans and mississippi for a corps of five|hundred volunteer cavalry the temporary arrangement have propose may perhaps render this unnecessary but inform with great pleasure of the promptitude with which the inhabitant of those territory have tender service in defence of country have do honor to entitle to the confidence of fellow citizen in every part of the union and must strengthen the general determination to protect efficaciously under all circumstance which may occur have receive information that in another part of the|united|state a great number of private individual be combine together arming and organize contrary to law to carry on military expedition against the territory of spain think necessary by proclamation as well as by special order to take measure for prevent and suppress this enterprise for seize the vessel arm and other mean provide for and for arrest and bring to justice author and abettor be due to that good faith which ought ever to be the rule of action in public as well as in private transaction be due to good order and regular government that while the public force be act strictly on the defensive and merely to protect citizen from aggression the criminal attempt of private individual to decide for country the question of peace or war by commence active and unauthorized hostility should be promptly and efficaciously suppress whether will be necessary to enlarge regular force will depend on the result of negotiation with spain but as be uncertain when that result will be know the provisional measure requisite for that and to meet any pressure intervene in that|quarter will be a subject for early consideration the possession of both bank of the mississippi reduce to a single point the defence of that river water and the country adjacent become highly necessary to provide for that point a more adequate security some position above mouth command the passage of the river should be render sufficiently strong to cover the armed vessel which may be station there for defence and in conjunction with to present an insuperable obstacle to any force attempt to pass the approach to the city of new|orleans from the|eastern|quarter also will require to be examine and more effectually

and prepare these important survey in addition to those before possess furnish material for commence an accurate map of the mississippi and western water some principal river however remain still to be explore toward which the authorization of congress by moderate appropriation will be requisite congratulate fellow citizen on the approach of the period at which may interpose authority constitutionally to withdraw the citizen of the|united|state from all further participation in those violation of human right which have be so long continue on the unoffende inhabitant of africa and which the morality the reputation and the good interest of country have long be eager to proscribe although no law may pass can take prohibitory effect till the|first|day|of|the|year|one|thousand|eight|hundred|and|eight yet the intervene period be not too long to prevent by timely notice expedition which can not be complete before that|day the receipt at the treasury during the|year|ending|on|the|30th|of|september last have amount to near fifteen|millions|of|dollar which have enable after meet the current demand to pay two|millions|seven|hundred|thousand|dollar of the american claim in part of the price of louisiana to pay of the fund debt upward of three|million of principal and nearly|four of interest and in addition to reimburse in the course of the|present|month near two|million of five|and|a|half per cent stock these payment and reimbursement of the fund debt with those which have be make in precede will at the close of the|present|year have extinguish upwards of three|million of principal the duty compose the mediterranean fund will cease by law at the end of the present season considering however that be levy chiefly on luxury and that have an impost on salt a necessary of life the free use of which other wise be so important recommend to consideration the suppression of the duty on salt and the continuation of the mediterranean fund instead thereof for a short time after which that also will become unnecessary for any purpose now within contemplation when both of these branch of revenue shall in this way be relinquish there will still ere long be an accumulation of money in the treasury beyond the instalment of public debt which be permit by contract to pay can not then without a modification assent to by the public creditor be apply to the extinguishment of this debt and the complete liberation of revenue the most desirable of all object nor if peace continue will be want for any other exist purpose the question therefore now come forward to what other object shall these surplus be appropriate and the whole surplus of impost after the entire discharge of the public debt and during those interval when the purpose of war shall not call for shall suppress the impost and give that advantage to foreign over domestic manufacture on a few article of more general and necessary use the suppression in due season will doubtless be right but the great mass of the article on which impost be pay be foreign luxury purchase by those only who be rich enough to afford the use of patriotism would certainly prefer continuance and application to the great purpose of the public education road river canal and such other object of public improvement as may be think proper to add to the constitutional enumeration of federal power by these operation new channel of communication will be open between the states the line of separation will disappear interest will be identify and union cement by new and indissoluble tie education be here place among the article of public care not that would be propose to take ordinary branch out of the hand of private enterprise which manage so much better all the concern to which be equal but a public institution can alone supply those science which though rarely call for be yet necessary to complete the circle all the part of which contribute to the improvement of the country and some of to preservation the subject be now propose for the consideration of congress because if approve by the time the state legislature shall have deliberate on this extension of the federal trust and the law shall be pass and other arrangement make for execution the necessary fund will be on hand and without employment suppose an amendment to the constitution by consent of the states necessary because the object now recommend be not among those enumerate in the constitution and to which permit the public money to be apply the

to obtain justice as well as to restore friendship think a special mission advisable and accordingly appoint james|monroe minister extraordinary and plenipotentiary to repair to madrid and in conjunction with minister resident there to endeavor to procure a ratification of the former convention and to come to an understanding with spain as to the boundary of louisiana appear at once that policy be to reserve for event and in the meantime to keep difference in an undetermined state this will be evident from the paper now communicate to after of fruitless endeavor to bring to some

actual rupture or that at the date of last advice from paris government have any suspicion of the hostile attitude spain have take here on the contrary have reason to believe that be dispose to effect a settlement on a plan analogous to what minister have propose and so comprehensive as to remove as far as possible the ground of future collision and controversy on the eastern as well as western side of the mississippi the present crisis in europe be favorable for press such a settlement and not a moment should be lose in avail of should pass unimproved situation would become much more difficult formal war be not necessary be not probable will follow but the protection of citizen the spirit and honor of country require that force should be interpose to a certain degree will probably contribute to advance the object of peace but the course to be pursue will require the command of mean which belong to congress exclusively to yield or to deny to communicate every fact material for

commerce new principle too have be interpolate into the law of nation found neither in justice nor the usage or acknowledgment of nation accord to these belligerent take to a commerce with own enemy which deny to a neutral on the ground of aiding that enemy in the war but reason revolt at such an inconsistency and the neutral have equal right with the belligerent to decide the question the interest of constituent and the duty of maintain the authority of reason the only umpire between just nation impose on the obligation of provide an effectual and determined opposition to a doctrine so injurious to the right of peaceable nation indeed the confidence ought to have in the justice of other still countenance the hope that a sounder view of those right will of induce from every

be unsettled have avoid change the state of thing by take new post or strengthen in the dispute territory in the hope that the other power would not by contrary conduct oblige to meet example and endanger conflict of authority the issue of which may not be easily control but in this hope have now reason to lessen confidence inroad have be recently make into the|territories|of|orleans and the mississippi citizen have be seize and property plunder in the very part of the former which have be actually deliver up by spain and this by the regular officer and soldier of that government have therefore find necessary at length to give order to troop on that frontier to be in readiness to protect citizen and to repel by arm any similar aggression in future other detail necessary for full information of the state of thing between this country and that shall be the subject of another communication in review these injury from some of the belligerent power the moderation the firmness and the wisdom of the legislature will all be call into action ought still to hope that time and a more correct estimate of interest as well as of character will produce the justice be bind to expect but should any nation deceive by false calculation and disappointment that expectation must join in unprofitable contest of try which party can do the other the most harm some of these injury may perhaps admit a peaceable remedy where that be competent be always the most desirable but some of be of a nature to be meet by force only and all of may lead to can not therefore but recommend such

will consider whether would not be expedient for a state of peace as well as war so to organize or class the militia as would enable on any sudden emergency to call for the service of the young portion unencumbered with the old and those have family upward of able bodied man between|the|ages|of|18|and|26|year which the last census shew may now count within limit will furnish a competent number for offense or defense in any point where may be want and will give time for raise regular force after the necessity of shall become certain and the reducing to the early period of life all active service can not but be desirable to young citizen of the present as well as future time inasmuch as engage to in more advanced age a quiet and undisturbed repose in the bosom of family can not then but earnestly recommend to early consideration the expediency of so modify militia system as by a separation of the more active part from that which be less so may draw from when necessary an efficient corps fit for real and active service and to be call to in regular rotation considerable provision have be make under former authority from congress of material for the construction of ship of war of gun these material be on hand subject to the further will of the legislature turn from these unpleasant view of violence and wrong congratulate on the liberation of fellow citizen who be

which have conclude warefare with that state an article for the ransom of citizen have be agree to an operation by land by a small band of countryman and other engage for the occasion in conjunction with the troop of the ex - bashaw of that county gallantly conduct by late consul eaton and successful enterprise on the city of derne contribute doubtless to the impression which produce peace and the concluison of this prevent opportunity of which the officer and man of squadron destine for tripoli would have avail to emulate the act of valor exhibit by brother in the attack of last|year

an opening for some present promotion by enlarge peace establishment of captain and lieutenant with tunis some misunderstanding have arise not yet sufficiently explain but friendly discussion with ambassador recently arrive and a mutual disposition to do whatever be just and reasonable can not fail of dissipate these so that may consider peace on that coast generally to be on as sound a footing

shall be keep in constant service in time of peace and prescribe that shall be man by not third of complement of seamen and ordinary seaman whether a frigate may be trust to third only of proper complement of man must depend on the nature of the service on which be order that may sometimes for safety as well as to insure object require full complement in advert to this subject congress will perhaps consider whether the good limitation on the executive discretion in this case would not be by the number of seaman which may be employ in the whole service rather than by the number of the vessel occasion oftener arise for the employment of small than of large vessel and would lessen risk as well as expense to be authorize to employ of preference the limitation suggest by the number of seaman would admit a selection of vessel best adapt to the service indian neighbor be advance many of with spirit and other begin to engage in the pursuit of agriculture and household manufacture be

scarcely at all affect by time the great abundance of running water which this situation possess at height far above the level of the tide if employ as be practice for lock navigation furnish the mean for raise and lay up vessel on a dry and shelter bed and should the measure be find useful here similar depository for lay up as well as for building and repair vessel may hereafter be undertake at other navy yard offer the same mean the plan and estimate of the work prepare by a person of skill and experience will be present to without delay and from this will be see that scarcely more than

buy send an agent in whom could trust to see that consent be free and the sale fair all be report to be free and fair the land be property the right to sell be of the right of property to forbid the exercise of that right would be a wrong to nation nor do think brother that the sale of land be under all circumstance injurious to people while depend on hunting the more extensive the forest around the more game would yield but go into a state of agriculture may be as advantageous to a society as be to an individual who have more land than can improve to sell a part and lie out the money in

above all price other circumstance combine with the increase of number have produce an augmentation of revenue arise from consumption in a ratio far beyond that of population alone and though the change of foreign relation now take place so desirably for the world may for a season affect this branch of revenue yet weigh all probability of expense as well as of income there be reasonable ground of confidence that may now safely dispense with all the internal taxis comprehending excise stamp auction license carriage and refined sugar to which the postage on newspaper may be add to facilitate the progress of information and that the remain source of revenue will be sufficient to provide for the support of government to pay the interest on the public debt and to discharge the principal in short period than the law or the general expectation have contemplate war indeed and untoward event may change this prospect of thing and call for expense which the impost could not meet but sound principle will not justify tax the industry of fellow citizen to accumulate treasure for war to happen know not when and which may not perhaps happen but from the temptation offer by that treasure these view however of reduce burden be form on the expectation that a sensible and at the same time a salutary reduction may take place in habitual expenditure for this purpose those of the civil

the treasury or from citizen time have not permit a perfect enumeration the ramification of office be too multiple and remote to be completely trace in a first trial among those who be dependent on executive discretion have begin the reduction of what be deem necessary the expense of diplomatic agency have be considerably diminish the inspector of internal revenue who be find to obstruct the accountability of the institution have be discontinue several agency create by executive authority on salary fix by that also have be suppress and should suggest the expediency of regulate that power by law so as to subject exercise to legislative inspection and sanction other reformation of the same kind will be pursue with that caution which be requisite in remove useless thing not to injure what be retain but the great mass of public office be establish by law and therefore by law alone can be abolish should the legislature think expedient to pass this roll in review and try all part by the test of public utility may be assure of every aid and light which executive information can yield consider the general tendency to multiply office and dependency and to increase expense to the ultimate term of burden which the citizen can bear behoove to avail of every occasion which present for take off the surcharge that may never be see here that after leave to labor the small portion of earning on which can subsist government shall consume the residue of what be institute to guard in care too of the public contribution intrust to direction would be prudent to multiply barrier against dissipation by appropriate specific sum to every specific purpose susceptible of definition by disallow application of money vary from the appropriation in object or transcend in amount by reduce the undefined field of contingency and thereby circumscribe discretionary power over money and by bring back to a single department all accountability for money where the examination may be prompt

as shall think proper to adopt a statement have be form by the secretary of war on mature consideration of all the post and station where garrison will be expedient and of the number of man requisite for each garrison the whole amount be considerably short of the present military establishment for the surplus no particular use can be point out for defence against invasion number be as nothing nor

can say have do everything for the militia which could do be an enemy at door the provision of military store on hand will be lay before that may judge of the addition still requisite with respect to the extent to which naval preparation should be carry some difference of opinion may be expect to appear but just attention to the circumstance of every part of the union will doubtless reconcile all a small force will probably continue to be want for actual service in the mediterranean whatever annual sum beyond that may think proper to appropriate to naval preparation would perhaps be better employ in provide those article which may be keep without waste or consumption and be in readiness when any exigence call into use progress have be make as will appear by paper now communicate in provide material for gun ship as direct by law how far the authority give by the legislature for procure and establish site for naval purpose have be perfectly understand and pursue in the execution

commissioner appoint to provide suitable building for the accommodation of congress and of the president and of the public office of the government have make a report of the state of the building design for those purpose in the city of washington from which conclude that the removal of the seat of government to that place at the time require will be practicable and the accommodation satisfactory report will be lay before gentleman of the|house|of|representatives shall direct the estimate of the appropriation necessary for the service of the|ensuing|year together with an account of the revenue and expenditure to be lay before during a period in which a great portion of the civilized world have be involve in a war unusually calamitous and destructive be not to be expect that the|united|states could be exempt from extraordinary burthen although the period be not arrive when the measure adopt to secure country against foreign attack can be renounce yet be alike necessary for the honor of the government and the satisfaction of the community that an exact economy should be maintain invite gentleman to investigate the different branch of the public expenditure the examination will lead to beneficial retrenchment or produce a conviction of the wisdom of the measure to which the expenditure relate gentleman of the senate and gentlemen of the|house|of|representatives at a period like the present when momentous change be occur and every|hour be prepare new and great event in the political world when a spirit of war be prevalent in almost every nation with whose affair the interest of the|united|state have any connection unsafe and precarious would be situation be to neglect the mean of maintain just right the result of the mission to france be uncertain but however may terminate a steady perseverance in a system of national defense commensurate with resource and the situation of country be an obvious dictate of wisdom for remotely as be place from the belligerent nation and desirous as be by do justice to all to avoid offense to any nothing short of the power of repel aggression will secure to country a rational prospect of escape the calamity of war or national degradation as to be anxious desire so to execute the trust repose in as to render the people of prosperous and happy rely with entire confidence on cooperation in object equally care and that mutual labor will serve to increase and confirm union among fellow citizen and an unshaken attachment to government transcript gentleman of the senate and gentlemen of the|house|of|representatives while with reverence and resignation contemplate the dispensation of divine|providence in the alarming and destructive pestilence with which several of city and town have be visit there be cause for gratitude and mutual congratulation that the malady have disappear and that be again permit to assemble in safety at the seat of government for the discharge of important duty but when reflect that this fatal disorder have within a|few|year make repeat ravage in some of principal sea port and with increase malignancy and when consider the magnitude of the evil arise from the interruption of public and private business whereby the national interest be deeply affected think duty to invite the|legislature|of|the|union to examine the expediency of establish suitable regulation in aid of the health law of the respective states for these be form on the idea that contagious sickness may be communicate through the channel of commerce there seem to be a necessity that congress who alone can regulate trade should frame a system which while may tend to preserve the general health may be compatible with the interest of commerce and the safety of the revenue while think on this calamity and sympathize with the immediate sufferer have abundant reason to present to the supreme be annual oblation of gratitude for a liberal participation in the ordinary blessing of providence to the usual subject of gratitude can not omit to add of the 1st importance to well being and safety mean that spirit which have arise in country against the menace and aggression of a foreign nation a manly sense of national honor dignity and independence have appear which if encourage and invigorate by every branch of the government will enable to view undismaye the enterprise of any foreign power and become the sure foundation of national prosperity and glory the course of the transaction in relation to the|united|state and france which have come to knowledge during recess will be make the subject of a future communication that communication will confirm the ultimate failure of the measure which have be take by the|united|state toward an amicable adjustment of difference with that power will at the same time perceive that the|french|government appear solicitous to impress the opinion that be averse to a rupture with this country and that have in a qualified manner declare willing to receive a minister from the|united|state for the purpose of restore a good understanding be unfortunate for profession of this kind that should be express in term which may countenance the inadmissible pretension of a right to prescribe the qualification which a minister from the|united|state should possess and that while france be assert the existence of a disposition on part to conciliate with sincerity the difference which have arise the sincerity of a like disposition on the part of the|united|state of which so many demonstrative proof have be give should even be indirectly question be also worthy of observation that the decree of the directory allege to be intend to restrain the depredation of french cruiser on commerce have not give and can not give any relief enjoin to conform to all the law of france relative to cruising and prize while these law be the source of the depredation of which have so long so justly and so fruitlessly complain the law of france enact in january last which subject to capture and condemnation neutral vessel and cargo if any portion of the latter be of british fabric or produce although the entire property belong to neutral instead of be rescind have lately receive a confirmation by the failure of a proposition for repeal while this law which be an unequivocal act of war on the commerce of the nation attack continue in force those nation can see in the|french|government only a power regardless of essential right of independence and sovereignty and if possess the mean can reconcile nothing with interest and honor but a firm resistance hitherto therefore nothing be discoverable in the conduct of france which ought to change or relax measure of defense on the contrary to extend and invigorate be true policy have no reason to regret that these measure have be thus far adopt and pursue and in proportion as enlarge view of the portentous and incalculable situation of europe shall discover new and cogent motif for the full development of energy and resource but in demonstrating by conduct that do not fear war in the necessary protection of right and honor shall give no room to infer that abandon the desire of peace an efficient preparation for war can alone insure peace be peace that have uniformly and perseveringly cultivate and harmony between and france may be restore at option but to send another minister without more determinate assurance that would be receive would be an act of humiliation to which the|united|state ought not to submit must therefore be leave with france if be indeed desirous of accommodation to take the requisite step the|united|state will steadily observe the maxim by which have hitherto be govern will respect the sacred right of embassy and with a sincere disposition on the part of france to desist from hostility to make reparation for the injury heretofore inflict on commerce and to do justice in future there will be no obstacle to the restoration of a friendly intercourse in make to this declaration give a pledge to france and the world that the executive authority of this country still adhere to the humane and pacific policy which have invariably govern proceeding in conformity with the wish of the other branch of the government and of the people of the|united|state but consider the late manifestation of policy toward foreign nation deem a duty deliberately and solemnly to declare opinion that whether negotiate with or not vigorous preparation for war will be alike indispensable these alone will give to an equal treaty and insure observance among the measure of preparation which appear expedient take the liberty to recall attention to the naval establishment the beneficial effect of the small naval armament provide under the act of the last session be know and acknowledge perhaps no country ever experience more sudden and remarkable advantage from any measure of policy than have derive from the arming for maritime protection and defense ought without loss of time to lay the foundation for an increase of navy to a size sufficient to guard coast and protect trade such a naval force as be doubtless in the power of the|united|state to create and maintain would also afford to the good mean of general defense by facilitate the safe transportation of troop and store to every part of extensive coast to accomplish this important object a prudent foresight require that systematic measure be adopt for procure at all time the requisite timber and other supply in what manner this shall be do leave to consideration will now advert gentleman to some matter of less moment but proper to be communicate to after the spanish garrison have evacuate the post occupy at the natchez and walnut|hill the commissioner of the|united|states commence observation to ascertain the point near the mississippi which terminate the northernmost part of the 31st degree of north latitude from thence proceed to run the boundary line between the|united|state and spain be afterwards join by the spanish commissioner when the work of the former be confirm and proceed together to the demarcation of the line recent information render probably that the|southern|indians either instigate to oppose the demarcation or jealous of the consequence of suffer white people to run a line over land to which the indian title have not be extinguish have ere this time stop the progress of the commissioner and consider the mischief which may result from continue the demarcation in opposition to the will of the indian tribe the great expense attend and that the boundary which the commissioner have actually establish probably extend at least as far as the indian title have be extinguish will perhaps become expedient and necessary to suspend further proceeding by recall commissioner the commissioner appoint in pursuance of the 5th article of the treaty of amity commerce and navigation between the|united|state and to determine what river be truly intend under the name of the river st.|croix mention in the treaty of peace and form a part of the boundary therein describe have finally decide that question on the|25th|of|october make declaration that a river call scoodiac which fall into passamaquoddy|bay at northwestern quarter be the true st.|croix intend in the treaty of peace as far as great fork where of stream come from the westward and the other from the northward and that the latter stream be the continuation of the|st.|croix to source this decision be understand will preclude all contention among the individual claimant as seem that the scoodiac and northern branch bind the grant of land which have be make by the respective adjoin government a subordinate question however have be suggest still remain to be determine between the mouth of the|st.|croix as now settle and what be usually call the|bay|of|fundy lie a number of valuable island the commissioner have not continue the boundary line through any channel of these island and unless the bay of passamaquoddy be a part of the|bay|of|fundy this further adjustment of boundary will be necessary but be apprehend that this will not be a matter of any difficulty such progress have be make in the examination and decision of case of capture and condemnation of american vessel which be the subject of the 7th article of the treaty of amity commerce and navigation between the|united|state and great|britain that be suppose the commissioner will be able to bring business to a conclusion in august|of|the|ensuing|year the commissioner act under the 25th article of the treaty between the|united|state and spain have adjust most of the claim of citizen for loss sustain in consequence of vessel and cargo have be take by the subject of catholic majesty during the late war between france and spain various circumstance have concur to delay the execution of the law for augment the military establishment among these the desire of obtain the full information to direct the good selection of officer as this object will now be speedily accomplish be expect that the raise and organizing of the troop will proceed without obstacle and with effect gentleman of the|house|of|representatives have direct an estimate of the appropriation which will be necessary for the service of the|ensuing|year to be lay before accompany with a view of the public receipt and expenditure to a recent period will afford satisfaction to infer the great extent and solidity of the public resource from the prosperous state of the finance notwithstanding the unexampled embarrassment which have attend commerce when reflect on the conspicuous example of patriotism and liberality which have be exhibit by mercantile fellow citizen and how great a proportion of the public resource depend on enterprise will naturally consider whether convenience can not be promote and reconcile with the security of the revenue by a revision of the system by which the collection be at present regulate during recess measure have be steadily pursue for effect the valuation and return direct by the act of the last session preliminary to the assessment and collection of a direct tax no other delay or obstacle have be experience except such as be expect to arise from the great extent of country and the magnitude and novelty of the operation and enough have be accomplish to assure a fulfillment of the view of the legislature gentleman of the senate and gentlemen of the|house|of|representatives can not close this address without once more adverting to political situation and inculcate the essential importance of unite in the maintenance of dear interest and trust that by the temper and wisdom of proceeding and by a harmony of measure shall secure to country that weight and respect to which be so justly entitle transcript as the safety and prosperity of nation ultimately and essentially depend on the protection and the blessing of almighty god and the national acknowledgment of this truth be not only an indispensable duty which the people owe to but a duty whose natural influence be favorable to the promotion of that morality and piety without which social happiness can not exist nor the blessing of a free government be enjoy and as this duty at all time incumbent be so especially in season of difficulty or of danger when exist or threatening calamity the just judgment of god against prevalent iniquity be a loud call to repentance and reformation and as the|united|states|of|america be at present place in a hazardous and afflictive situation by the unfriendly disposition conduct and demand of a foreign power evince by repeat refusal to receive messenger of reconciliation and peace by depredation on commerce and the infliction of injury on very many of fellow citizen while engage in lawful business on the sea under these consideration have appear to that the duty of implore the mercy and benediction of heaven on country demand at this time a special attention from inhabitant have therefore think fit to recommend and do hereby recommend that wednesday the|9th|day|of|may next be observe throughout

without investigation be to treat neither as ally nor as friend nor as a sovereign state with this conduct of the french government will be proper to take into view the public audience give to the late minister of the|united|state on take leave of the speech of the president disclose sentiment more alarming than the refusal of a minister because more dangerous to independence and union and at the same time studiously mark with indignity toward the government of the|united|state evince a disposition to separate the people of the|united|state from the government to persuade that have different affection principle and interest from those of fellow citizen whom have choose to manage common concern and thus to produce division fatal to peace such attempt ought to be repel with a decision which shall convince france and the world that be not a degraded people humiliate under a colonial spirit of fear and sense of inferiority fit to be the miserable instrument of foreign influence and regardless of national honor character and interest should have be happy to have throw a veil over these transaction if have be possible to conceal but have pass on the great theater of the world in the face of all europe and america and with such circumstance of publicity and solemnity that can not be disguise and will not soon be forget have inflict a wound in the american breast be sincere desire however that may be heal be sincere desire and in this presume concur with and with constituent to preserve peace and friendship with all nation and believe that neither the honor nor the interest of the|united|state absolutely forbid the repetition of advance for secure these desirable object with france shall institute a fresh attempt at negotiation and shall not fail to promote and accelerate an accommodation on term compatible with the right duty interest and honor of the nation if have commit error and these can be demonstrate shall be willing on conviction to redress and equal measure of justice have a right to expect from france and every other nation the diplomatic intercourse between the|united|state and france be at present suspend the government have no means of obtain official information from that country nevertheless there be reason to believe that the|executive|directory pass a decree on the|2nd|of|march last contravening in part the treaty of amity and commerce of injurious to lawful commerce and endanger the life of citizen a copy of this decree will be lay before while be endeavor to adjust all difference with france by amicable negotiation the progress of the war in europe the depredation on commerce the personal injury to citizen and the general complexion of affair render indispensable duty to recommend to consideration effectual measure of defense the commerce of the|united|state have become an interesting object of attention whether consider in relation to the wealth and finance or the strength and resource of the nation with a sea coast of near in extent open a wide field for fishery navigation and commerce a great portion of citizen naturally apply industry and enterprise to these object any serious and permanent injury to commerce would not fail to produce the most embarrassing disorder to prevent from be undermine and destroy be essential that receive an adequate protection the naval establishment must occur to every man who consider the injury commit on commerce the insult offer to citizen and the description of vessel by which these abuse have be practice as the suffering of mercantile and sea fare citizen can not be ascribe to the omission of duty demandable consider the neutral situation of country be to be attribute to the hope of impunity arise from a suppose inability on part to afford protection to resist the consequence of such impression on the mind of foreign nation and to guard against the degradation and servility which must finally stamp on the american character be an important duty of government a naval power next to the militia be the natural defense of the|united|state the experience of the last war would be sufficient to shew that a moderate naval force such as would be easily within the present ability of the union would have be sufficient to have baffle many formidable transportation of troop from state to another which be then practice sea coast from great extent be more easily annoyed and more easily defend by a naval force than any other with all the material country abound in skill naval architect and navigator be equal to any and commander and sea man will not be want but although the establishment of a permanent system of naval defense appear to be requisite be sensible can not be form so speedily and extensively as the present crisis demand hitherto have think proper to prevent the sailing of armed vessel except on voyage to the|east|indy where general usage and the danger from pirate appear to render the permission proper yet the restriction have originate solely from a wish to prevent collision with the power at war contravene the act of congress of june|1794 and not from any doubt entertain by of the policy and propriety of permit vessel to employ mean of defense while engage in a lawful foreign commerce remain for congress to prescribe such regulation as will enable sea fare citizen to defend against violation of the law of nation and at the same time restrain from commit act of hostility against the power at war in addition to this voluntary provision for defense by individual citizen appear to necessary to equip the frigate and provide other vessel of inferior force to take under convoy such merchant vessel as shall remain unarmed the great part of the cruiser whose depredation have be most injurious have be build and some of partially equip in the|united|state although an effectual remedy may be attend with difficulty yet have think duty to present the subject generally to consideration if a mode can be devise by the wisdom of congress to prevent the resource of the|united|state from be convert into the mean of annoy trade a great evil will be prevent with the same view think proper to mention that some of citizen resident abroad have fit out privateer and other have voluntarily take the command or enter on board of and commit spoliation on the commerce of the|united|state such unnatural and iniquitous practice can be restrain only by severe punishment but besides a protection of commerce on the sea think highly necessary to protect at home where be collect in most important port the distance of the|united|state from europe and the well know promptitude ardor and courage of the people in defense of country happily diminish the probability of invasion nevertheless to guard against sudden and predatory incursion the situation of some of principal sea port demand consideration and as country be vulnerable in other interest besides those of commerce will seriously deliberate whether the mean of general defense ought not to be increase by an addition to the regular artillery and cavalry and by arrangement for form a provisional army with the same view and as a measure

public account to the extent of the ordinary demand for the public service recommend by strong consideration of national policy as an exception to the general rule ought country to remain in such case dependant on foreign supply precarious because liable to be interrupt if the necessary articles should in this mode cost more in time of peace will not the security and independence thence arise form an ample compensation establishment of this sort commensurate only with the call of the public service in time of peace will in time of war easily be extend in proportion to the exigency of the government and may even perhaps be make to yield a surplus for the supply of citizens at large so as to mitigate the privation from the interruption of trade if adopt the plan ought to exclude all those branch which be already or likely soon to be establish in the country in order that there may be no danger of interference with pursuit of individual industry will not be doubt that with reference either to individual or national|welfare,|agriculture be of primary importance in proportion as nation advance in population and other circumstance of maturity this truth become more apparent and render the cultivation of the soil more and more an object of public patronage institution for promote grow up support by the public purse and to what object can be dedicate with great propriety among the mean which have be employ to this end none have be attend with great success than the establishment of boards compose of proper character charge with collect and diffuse information and enable by premium and small pecuniary aid to encourage and assist a spirit of discovery and improvement this species of establishment contribute doubly to the increase of improvement by stimulate to enterprise and experiment and by draw to a common centre the result everywhere of individual skill and observation and spread thence over the whole nation experience accordingly have shew that be very cheap instruments of immense national benefit have heretofore propose to the consideration of congress the expediency of establish a national|university and also a|military|academy the desirableness of both these institution have so constantly increase with every new view have take of the subject that can not omit the opportunity of once for all recall attention to the assembly to which address be too enlighten not to be fully sensible how much a flourishing state of the|arts|and|science contribute to national prosperity and reputation true be that country much to honor contain many seminaries of learn highly respectable and useful but the fund upon which rest be too narrow to command the ablest professors in the different department of liberal knowledge for the institution contemplate though would be excellent auxiliary amongst the motif to such an institution the assimilation of the principle opinion and manner of country man but the common education of a portion of youth from every quarter well deserve attention the more homogeneous citizens can be make in these particular the great will be prospect of permanent union and a primary object of such a national|institution should be the education of youth in the science of government in a republic what species of knowledge can be equally important and what duty more press on legislature than to patronize a plan for communicate to those who be to be the future guardian of the liberty of the country the|institution|of|a|military|academy be also recommend by cogent reason however pacific the general policy of a nation may be ought never to be without an adequate stock of military knowledge for emergency the first would impair the energy of character and both would hazard safety or expose to great evil when war could not be avoid besides that war may often not depend upon own choice in proportion as the observance of pacific maxim may exempt a nation from the necessity of practise the rule of the military art ought to be care in preserve and transmit by proper establishment the knowledge of that art whatever argument may be draw from particular example superficially view a thorough examination of the subject will evince that the|art|of|war be at once comprehensive and complicated that demand much previous study and that the possession of in most improved and perfect state be always of great moment to the security of a nation this therefore ought to be a serious care of every government and for this purpose an academy where a regular course of instruction be give be an obvious expedient which different nation have successfully employ the compensation to the officers of the united states in various instance and in none more than in respect to the most important station appear to call for legislative revision the consequence of a defective provision be of serious import to the government if private wealth be to supply the defect of public retribution will greatly contract the sphere within which the selection of characters|for|office be to be make and will proportionally diminish the probability of a choice of men able as well as upright besides that would be repugnant to the vital principle of government virtually to exclude from public trust talent and virtue unless accompany by wealth while in external relation some serious inconvenience and embarrassment have be overcome and other lessen be with much pain and deep regret mention that circumstance of a very unwelcome nature have lately occur trade have suffer and be suffer extensive injury in the|west|indy from the cruisers and agent of the|french|republic and communication have be receive from minister here which indicate the danger of a further disturbance of commerce by authority and which be in other respect far from agreeable have be constant sincere and earnest wish in conformity with that of nation to maintain cordial harmony and a perfectly friendly understanding with that republic this wish remain unabated and shall persevere in the endeavour to fulfil to the utmost extent of what shall be consistent with a just and indispensable regard to the right and honour of country nor will easily cease to cherish the expectation that a spirit of justice candour and friendship on the part of the republic will eventually ensure success in pursue this course however can not forget what be due to the character of government|and|nation or to a full and entire confidence in the good sense patriotism selfrespect and fortitude of countrymen reserve for a special message a more particular communication on this interesting subject gentleman of the|house|of|representatives have direct an estimate of the appropriations necessary for the service of the|ensuing|year to be submit from the proper department with a view of the public receipt and expenditure to the late period to which an account can be prepare be with satisfaction be able to inform that the|united|state continue in a state of progressive improvement a reinforcement of the exist provision for discharge public debt be mention in address at the opening of the last session some preliminary step be take towards the maturing of which will no doubt engage zealous attention during the present will only add that will afford heart feel satisfaction to concur in such further measure as will ascertain to country the prospect of a speedy extinguishment of the debt posterity may have cause to regret if from any motive interval of tranquillity be leave unimproved for accelerate this valuable end gentleman of the senate and of the|house|of|representatives solicitude to see the militia of the|united|state place on an efficient establishment have be so often and so ardently express that shall but barely recall the subject to view on the present occasion at the same time that shall submit to enquiry whether harbours be yet sufficiently secure the situation in which now stand for the last time in the midst of the representatives of the people of the|united|state naturally recall the period when the administration of the present form of government commence and can not omit the occasion to congratulate and country on the success of the experiment nor to repeat fervent supplication to the|supreme|ruler|of|the|universe and sovereign|arbiter|of|nation that providential care may still be extend to the|united|state that the virtue and happiness of the people may be preserve and that the government which have institute for the protection of liberty maybe perpetual transcript the period for a new election of a citizen to administer the|executive|government of the|united|state be not far distant and the time actually arrive when thought must be employ in designate the person who be to be clothe with that important trust appear to proper especially as may conduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice that should now apprise of the resolution have form to decline be consider among the number of those out of whom a choice be to be make beg at the same time to do the justice to be assure that this resolution have not be take without a strict regard to all the consideration appertain to the relation which bind a dutiful citizen to country and that in withdraw the tender of service which silence in situation may imply be influence by no diminution of zeal for future interest no deficiency of grateful respect for past kindness but be support by a full conviction that the step be compatible with both the acceptance of and continuance hitherto in the office to which suffrage have twice call have be a uniform sacrifice of inclination to the opinion of duty and to a deference for what appear to be desire constantly hope that would have be much earlier in power consistently with motif which be not at liberty to disregard to return to that retirement from which have be reluctantly draw the strength of inclination to do this previous to the last election have even lead to the preparation of an address to declare to but mature reflection on the then perplexed and critical posture of affair with foreign nation and the unanimous advice of person entitle to confidence impel to abandon the idea rejoice that the state of concern external as well as internal no longer render the pursuit of inclination incompatible with the sentiment of duty or propriety and be persuade whatever partiality may be retain for service that in the present circumstance of country will not disapprove determination to retire the impression with which first undertake the arduous trust be explain on the proper occasion in the discharge of this trust will only say that have with good intention contribute toward the organization and administration of the government the good exertion of which a very fallible judgment be capable not unconscious in the outset of the inferiority of qualification experience in own eye perhaps still more in the eye of other have strengthen the motif to diffidence of and every day the increase weight of year admonish more and more that the shade of retirement be as necessary to as will be welcome satisfy that if any circumstance have give peculiar value to service be temporary have the consolation to believe that while choice and prudence invite to quit the political scene patriotism do not forbid in look forward to the moment which be intend to terminate the career of political life feeling do not permit to suspend the deep acknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which owe to beloved country for the many honor have confer upon still more for the steadfast confidence with which have support and for the opportunity have thence enjoy of manifest inviolable attachment by service faithful and persevering though in usefulness unequal to zeal if benefit have result to country from these service let always be remember to praise and as an instructive example in annal that under circumstance in which the passion agitate in every direction be liable to mislead amidst appearance sometimes dubious vicissitude of fortune often discourage in situation in which not unfrequently want of success have countenance the spirit of criticism the constancy of support be the essential prop of the effort and a guaranty of the plan by which be effect profoundly penetrate with this idea shall carry with to grave as a strong incitement to uncease vow that heaven may continue to the choice token of beneficence that union and brotherly affection may be perpetual that the free constitution which be the work of hand may be sacredly maintain that administration in every department may be stamp with wisdom and virtue that in fine the happiness of the people of these states under the auspex of liberty may be make complete by so careful a preservation and so prudent a use of this blessing as will acquire to the glory of recommend to the applause the affection and adoption of every nation which be yet a stranger to here perhaps ought to stop but a solicitude for welfare which can not end but with life and the apprehension of danger natural to that solicitude urge on an occasion like the present to offer to solemn contemplation and to recommend to frequent review some sentiment which be the result of much reflection of no inconsiderable observation and which appear to all important to the permanency of felicity as a people these will be offer to with the more freedom as can only see in the disintereste warning of a parting friend who can possibly have no personal motive to bias counsel nor can forget as an encouragement to indulgent reception of sentiment on a former and not dissimilar occasion interweave as be the love of liberty with every ligament of heart no recommendation of mine be necessary to fortify or confirm the attachment the unity of government which constitute people be also now dear to be justly so for be a main pillar in the edifice of real independence the support of tranquillity at home peace abroad of safety of prosperity of that very liberty which so highly prize but as be easy to foresee that from different cause and from different quarter much pain will be take many artifice employ to weaken in mind the conviction of this truth as this be the point in political fortress against which the battery of internal and external enemy will be most constantly and actively though often covertly and insidiously direct be of infinite moment that should properly estimate the immense value of national union to collective and individual happiness that should cherish a cordial habitual and immovable attachment to accustom yourself to think and speak of as of the palladium of political safety and prosperity watch for preservation with jealous anxiety discountenance whatever may suggest even a suspicion that can in any event be abandon and indignantly frown upon the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of country from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred tie which now link together the various part for this have every inducement of sympathy and interest citizen by birth or choice of a common country that country have a right to concentrate affection the name of american which belong to in national capacity must always exalt the just pride of patriotism more than any appellation derive from local discrimination with slight shade of difference have the same religion manner habit and political principle have in a common cause fight and triumph together the independence and liberty possess be the work of joint council and joint effort of common danger suffering and success but these consideration however powerfully address to sensibility be greatly outweigh by those which apply more immediately to interest here every portion of country find the most commanding motif for carefully guard and preserve the union of the whole the north in an unrestrained intercourse with the south protect by the equal law of a common government find in the production of the latter great additional resource of maritime and commercial enterprise and precious material of manufacture industry the south in the same intercourse benefit by the same agency of the north see agriculture grow and commerce expand turn partly into own channel the seamen of the north find particular navigation invigorate and while contribute in different way to nourish and increase the general mass of the national navigation look forward to the protection of a maritime strength to which be unequally adapt the east in a like intercourse with the west already find and in the progressive improvement of interior communication by land and water will more and more find a valuable vent for the commodity which bring from abroad or manufacture at home the west derive from the east supply requisite to growth and comfort and what be perhaps of still great consequence must of necessity owe the secure enjoyment of indispensable outlet for own production to the weight influence and the future maritime strength of the atlantic side of the union direct by an indissoluble community of interest as nation any other tenure by which the west can hold this essential advantage whether derive from own separate strength or from an apostate and unnatural connection with any foreign power must be intrinsically precarious while then every part of country thus feel an immediate and particular interest in union all the part combine can not fail to find in the united mass of mean and effort great strength great resource proportionably great security from external danger a less frequent interruption of peace by foreign nation and what be of inestimable value must derive from union an exemption from those broil and war between which so frequently afflict neighboring country not tie together by the same government which own rivalship alone would be sufficient to produce but which opposite foreign alliance attachment and intrigue would stimulate and imbitter hence likewise will avoid the necessity of those overgrow military establishment which under any form of government be inauspicious to liberty and which be to be regard as particularly hostile to republican liberty in this sense be that union ought to be consider as a main prop of liberty and that the love of the ought to endear to the preservation of the other these consideration speak a persuasive language to every reflect and virtuous mind and exhibit the continuance of the union as a primary object of patriotic desire be there a doubt whether a common government can embrace so large a sphere let experience solve to listen to mere speculation in such a case be criminal be authorize to hope that a proper organization of the whole with the auxiliary agency of government for the respective subdivision will afford a happy issue to the experiment be well worth a fair and full experiment with such powerful and obvious motif to union affect all part of country while experience shall not have demonstrate impracticability there will always be reason to distrust the patriotism of those who in any|quarter may endeavor to weaken band in contemplate the cause which may disturb union occur as matter of serious concern that any ground should have be furnish for characterize party by geographical discrimination northern and southern atlantic and western-- whence design man may endeavor to excite a belief that there be a real difference of local interest and view of the expedient of party to acquire influence within particular district be to misrepresent the opinion and aim of other district can not shield yourself too much against the jealousy and heartburning which spring from these misrepresentation tend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bind together by fraternal affection the inhabitant of western country have lately have a useful lesson on this head have see in the negotiation by the executive and in the unanimous ratification by the senate of the treaty with spain and in the universal satisfaction at that event throughout the|united|state a decisive proof how unfounded be the suspicion propagate among of a policy in the|general|government and in the|atlantic|state unfriendly to interest in regard to the mississippi have be witness to the formation of two|treatie that with great|britain and that with spain which secure to everything could desire in respect to foreign relation toward confirm prosperity will not be wisdom to rely for the preservation of these advantage on the union by which be procure will not henceforth be deaf to those adviser if such there be who would sever from brother and connect with alien to the efficacy and permanency of union a government for the whole be indispensable no alliance however strict between the part can be an adequate substitute must inevitably experience the infraction and interruption which all alliance in all time have experience sensible of this momentous truth have improve upon first essay by the adoption of a constitution|of|government better calculate than former for an intimate union and for the efficacious management of common concern this government the offspring of own choice uninfluenced and unawed adopt upon full investigation and mature deliberation completely free in principle in the distribution of power unite security with energy and contain within a provision for own amendment have a just claim to confidence and support respect for authority compliance with law acquiescence in measure be duty enjoin by the fundamental maxim of true liberty the basis of political system be the right of the people to make and to alter constitution of government but the constitution which at any time exist till change by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people be sacredly obligatory upon all the very idea of the power and the right of the people to establish government presuppose the duty of every individual to obey the establish government all obstruction to the execution of the law all combination and association under whatever plausible character with the real design to direct control counteract or awe the regular deliberation and action of the constitute authority be destructive of this fundamental principle and of fatal tendency serve to organize faction to give an artificial and extraordinary force to put in the place of the delegated will of the nation the will of a party often a small but artful and enterprising minority of the community and accord to the alternate triumph of different party to snake the public administration the mirror of the ill concert and incongruous project of faction rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome plan digest by common counsel and modify by mutual interest however combination or association of the above description may now and then answer popular end be likely in the course of time and thing to become potent engine by which cunning ambitious and unprincipled man will be enable to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for the rein of government destroy afterwards the very engine which have lift to unjust dominion toward the preservation of government and the permanency of present happy state be requisite not only that steadily discountenance irregular opposition to acknowledged authority but also that resist with care the spirit of innovation upon principle however specious the pretext method of assault may be to effect in the form of the constitution alteration which will impair the energy of the system and thus to undermine what can not be directly overthrow in all the change to which may be invite remember that time and habit be at least as necessary to fix the true character of government as of other human institution that experience be the sure standard by which to test the real tendency of the exist constitution of a country that facility in change upon the credit of mere hypothesis and opinion expose to perpetual change from the endless variety of hypothesis and opinion and remember especially that for the efficient management of common interest in a country so extensive as our a government of as much vigor as be consistent with the perfect security of liberty be indispensable liberty will find in such a government with power properly distribute and adjust sure guardian be indeed little else than a name where the government be too feeble to withstand the enterprise of faction to confine each member of the society within the limit prescribe by the law and to maintain all in the secure and tranquil enjoyment of the right of person and property have already intimate to the danger of party in the state with particular reference to the founding of on geographical discrimination let now take a more comprehensive view and warn in the most solemn manner against the baneful effect of the spirit of party generally this spirit unfortunately be inseparable from nature have root in the strong passion of the human mind exist under different shape in all government more or less stifle control or repress but in those of the popular form be see in great rankness and be truly bad enemy the alternate domination of faction over another sharpen by the spirit of revenge natural to party dissension which in different age and country have perpetrate the most horrid enormity be a frightful despotism but this lead at length to a more formal and permanent despotism the disorder and misery which result gradually incline the mind of man to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual and sooner or later the chief of some prevail faction more able or more fortunate than competitor turn this disposition to the purpose of own elevation on the ruin of public liberty without look forward to an extremity of this kind which nevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight the common and continual mischief of the spirit of party be sufficient to make the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain serve always to distract the public council and enfeeble the public administration agitate the community with ill rounded jealousy and false alarm kindle the animosity of part against another foment occasionally riot and insurrection open the door to foreign influence and corruption which find a facilitate access to the government through the channel of party passion thus the policy and the will of country be subject to the policy and will of another there be an opinion that party in free country be useful check upon the administration of the government and serve to keep alive the spirit of liberty this within certain limit be probably true and in government of a monarchical cast patriotism may look with indulgence if not with favor upon the spirit of party but in those of the popular character in government purely elective be a spirit not to be encourage from natural tendency be certain there will always be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose and there be constant danger of excess the effort ought to be by force of public opinion to mitigate and assuage a fire not to be quench demand a uniform vigilance to prevent bursting into a flame lest instead of warming should consume be important likewise that the habit of think in a free country should inspire caution in those intrust with administration to confine within respective constitutional sphere avoid in the exercise of the power of department to encroach upon another the spirit of encroachment tend to consolidate the power of all the department in and thus to create whatever the form of government a real despotism a just estimate of that love of power and proneness to abuse which predominate in the human heart be sufficient to satisfy of the truth of this position the necessity of reciprocal check in the exercise of political power by divide and distribute into different depository and constitute each the guardian of the public weal against invasion by the other have be evince by experiment ancient and modern some of in country and under own eye to preserve must be as necessary as to institute if in the opinion of the people the distribution or modification of the constitutional power be in any particular wrong let be correct by an amendment in the way which the constitution designate but let there be no change by usurpation for though this in instance may be the instrument of good be the customary weapon by which free government be destroy the precedent must always greatly overbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient benefit which the use can at any time yield of all the disposition and habit which lead to political prosperity religion and morality be indispensable support in vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism who should labor to subvert these great pillar of human happiness these firm prop of the duty of man and citizen the mere politician equally with the pious man ought to respect and to cherish a volume could not trace all connection with private and public felicity let simply be ask where be the security for property for reputation for life if the sense of religious obligation desert the oath which be the instrument of investigation in court of justice and let with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintain without religion whatever may be concede to the influence of refined education on mind of peculiar structure reason and experience both forbid to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle be substantially true that virtue or morality be a necessary spring of popular government the rule indeed extend with more or less force to every species of free government who that be a sincere friend to can look with indifference upon attempt to shake the foundation of the fabric promote then as an object of primary importance institution for the general diffusion of knowledge in proportion as the structure of a government give force to public opinion be essential that public opinion should be enlighten as a very important source of strength and security cherish public credit method of preserve be to use as sparingly as possible avoid occasion of expense by cultivate peace but remember also that timely disbursement to prepare for danger frequently prevent much great disbursement to repel avoid likewise the accumulation of debt not only by shun occasion of expense but by vigorous exertion in time of peace to discharge the debt which unavoidable war have occasion not ungenerously throw upon posterity the burthen which ought to bear the execution of these maxim belong to representative but be necessary that public opinion should cooperate to facilitate to the performance of duty be essential that should practically bear in mind that toward the payment of debt there must be revenue that to have revenue there must be taxis that no taxis can be devise which be not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant that thee intrinsic embarrassment inseparable from the selection of the proper object which be always a choice of difficulty ought to be a decisive motive for a candid construction of the conduct of the government in make and for a spirit of acquiescence in the measure for obtain revenue which the public exigency may at any time dictate observe good faith and justice toward all nation cultivate peace and harmony with all religion and morality enjoin this conduct and can be that good policy do not equally enjoin will be worthy of a free enlighten and at no distant period a great nation to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a people always guide by an exalt justice and benevolence who can doubt that in the course of time and thing the fruit of such a plan would richly repay any temporary advantage which may be lose by a steady adherence to can be that providence have not connect the permanent felicity of a nation with virtue the experiment at least be recommend by every sentiment which ennoble human nature alas be render impossible by vice in the execution of such a plan nothing be more essential than that permanent inveterate antipathy against particular nation and passionate attachment for other should be exclude and that in place of just and amicable feeling toward all should be cultivate the nation which indulge toward another an habitual hatred or an habitual fondness be in some degree a slave be a slave to animosity or to affection either of which be sufficient to lead astray from duty and interest antipathy in nation against another dispose each more readily to offer insult and injury to lay hold of slight cause of umbrage and to be haughty and intractable when accidental or trifle occasion of dispute occur hence frequent collision obstinate envenomed and bloody contest the nation prompt by ill will and resentment sometimes impel to war the government contrary to the good calculation of policy the government sometimes participate in the national propensity and adopt through passion what reason would reject at other time make the animosity of the nation subservient to project of hostility instigate by pride ambition and other sinister and pernicious motif the peace often sometimes perhaps the liberty of nation have be the victim so likewise a passionate attachment of nation for another produce a variety of evil sympathy for the favorite nation facilitate the illusion of an imaginary common interest in case where no real common interest exist and infuse into the enmity of the other betray the former into a participation in the quarrel and war of the latter without adequate inducement or justification lead also to concession to the favorite nation of privilege deny to other which be apt doubly to injure the nation make the concession by unnecessarily part with what ought to have be retain and by exciting jealousy ill will and a disposition to retaliate in the party from whom equal privilege be withhold and give to ambition corrupt or delude citizen who devote to the favorite nation facility to betray or sacrifice the interest of own country without odium sometimes even with popularity gilding with the appearance of a virtuous sense of obligation a commendable deference for public opinion or a laudable zeal for public good the base or foolish compliance of ambition corruption or infatuation as avenue to foreign influence in innumerable way such attachment be particularly alarming to the truly enlighten and independent patriot how many opportunity do afford to tamper with domestic faction to practice the art of seduction to mislead public opinion to influence or awe the public council such an attachment of a small or weak toward a great and powerful nation doom the former to be the satellite of the latter against the insidious wile of foreign influence conjure to believe fellow citizen the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake since history and experience prove that foreign influence be of the most baneful foe of republican government but that jealousy to be useful must be impartial else become the instrument of the very influence to be avoid instead of a defense against excessive partiality for foreign nation and excessive dislike of another cause those whom actuate to see danger only on side and serve to veil and even second the art of influence on the other real patriot who may resist the intrigue of the favorite be liable to become suspect and odious while tool and dupe usurp the applause and confidence of the people to surrender interest the great rule of conduct for in regard to foreign nation be in extend commercial relation to have with as little political connection as possible so far as have already form engagement let be fulfil with perfect good faith here let stop europe have a set of primary interest which to have none or a very remote relation hence must be engage in frequent controversy the cause of which be essentially foreign to concern hence therefore must be unwise in to implicate by artificial tie in the ordinary vicissitude of politic or the ordinary combination and collision of friendship or enmity detached and distant situation invite and enable to pursue a different course if remain people under an efficient government the period be not far off when may defy material injury from external annoyance when may take such an attitude as will cause the neutrality may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously respect when belligerent nation under the impossibility of make acquisition upon will not lightly hazard the give provocation when may choose peace or war as interest guide by justice shall counsel why forego the advantage of so peculiar a situation why quit own to stand upon foreign ground why by interweave destiny with that of any part of europe entangle peace and prosperity in the toil of european ambition rivalship interest humor or caprice be true policy to steer clear of permanent alliance with any portion of the foreign world so far mean as be now at liberty to do for let not be understand as capable of patronize infidelity to existing engagement hold the maxim no less applicable to public than to private affair that honesty be always the good policy repeat therefore let those engagement be unwise to extend take care always to keep by suitable establishment on a respectable defensive posture may safely trust to temporary alliance for extraordinary emergency harmony liberal intercourse with all nation be recommend by policy humanity and interest but even commercial policy should hold an equal and impartial hand neither seek nor grant exclusive favor or preference consult the natural course of thing diffuse and diversify by gentle mean the stream of commerce but force nothing establish with power so disposed in order to give trade a stable course to define the right of merchant and to enable the government to support conventional rule of intercourse the good that present circumstance and mutual opinion will permit but temporary and liable to be from time to time abandon or varied as experience and circumstance shall dictate constantly keep in view that be folly in nation to look for disinterested favor from another that must pay with a portion of independence for whatever may accept under that character that by such acceptance may place in the condition of have give equivalent for nominal favor and yet of be reproach with ingratitude for not give more there can be no great error than to expect or calculate upon real favor from nation to nation be an illusion which experience must cure which a just pride ought to discard in offer to countryman these counsel of an old and affectionate friend dare not hope will make the strong and lasting impression could wish that will control the usual current of the passion or prevent nation from run the course which have hitherto mark the destiny of nation but if may even flatter that may be productive of some partial benefit some occasional good that may now and then recur to moderate the fury of party spirit to warn against the mischief of foreign intrigue to guard against the imposture of pretend patriotism-- this hope will be a full recompense for the solicitude for welfare by which have be dictate how far in the discharge of official duty have be guide by the principle which have be delineate the public record and other evidence of conduct must witness to and to the world to the assurance of own conscience be that have at least believe to be guide by in relation to the still subsist war in europe proclamation of the be the index to plan sanction by approve voice and by that of representative in both houses|of|congress the spirit of that measure have continually govern uninfluence by any attempt to deter or divert from after deliberate examination with the aid of the good light could obtain be well satisfied that country under all the circumstance of the case have a right to take and be bind in duty and interest to take a neutral position have take determine as far as should depend upon to maintain with moderation perseverance and firmness the consideration which respect the right to hold this conduct be not necessary on this occasion to detail will only observe that accord to understanding of the matter that right so far from be deny by any of the belligerent power have be virtually admit by all the duty of hold a neutral conduct may be infer without anything more from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on every nation in case in which be free to act to maintain inviolate the relation of peace and amity toward other nation the inducement of interest for observe that conduct will best be refer to own reflection and experience with a predominant motive have be to endeavor to gain time to country to settle and mature yet recent institution and to progress without interruption to that degree of strength and consistency which be necessary to give humanly speak the command of own fortune though in review the incident of administration be unconscious of intentional error be nevertheless too sensible of defect not to think probable that may have commit many error whatever may be fervently beseech the almighty to avert or mitigate the evil to which may tend shall also carry with the hope that country will never cease to view with indulgence and that after five|year of life dedicate to service with an upright zeal the fault of incompetent ability will be consign to oblivion as must soon be to the mansion of rest rely on kindness in this as in other thing and actuate by that fervent love toward which be so natural to a man who view in the native soil of and progenitor for several generation anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat in which promise to realize without

transcript gentleman of the|house|of|representatives with the utmost attention have consider resolution of the|24th instant request to lay before house a copy of the instruction to the minister of the|united|state who negotiate the treaty with the|king|of|great|britain together with the correspondence and other document relative to that treaty except such of the say paper as any exist negotiation may render improper to be disclose in deliberate upon this subject be impossible for to lose sight of the principle which some have avow in discussion or to avoid extend view to the consequence which must flow from the admission of that principle trust that no part of conduct have ever indicate a disposition to withhold any information which the constitution have enjoin upon the president as a duty to give or which could be require of by either house|of|congress as a right and with truth affirm that have be as will continue to be while have the honor to preside in the government constant endeavour to harmonize with the other branch thereof so far as the trust delegate to by the people of the|united|state and sense of the obligation impose to preserve protect and defend the constitution will permit the nature of foreign negotiation require caution and success must often depend on secrecy and even when bring to a conclusion a full disclosure of all the measure demand or eventual concession which may have be propose or contemplate would be extremely impolitic for this may have a pernicious influence on future negotiation or produce immediate inconvenience perhaps danger and mischief in relation to other power the necessity of such caution and secrecy be cogent reason for vest the power of make treaties in the president with the advice and consent of the senate the principle on which that body be form confine to a small number of members to admit then a right in the|house|of|representatives to demand and to have as a matter of course all the papers respect a negotiation with a foreign power would be to establish a dangerous precedent do not occur that the inspection of the paper ask for be relative to any purpose under the cognizance of the|house|of|representatives except that of an impeachment which the resolution have not express repeat that have no disposition to withhold any information which the duty of station will permit or the public good shall require to be disclose and in fact all the papers affect the negotiation with be lay before the senate when the treaty be communicate for consideration and advice the course which the debate have take on the resolution of the house lead to some observation on the mode of make treaty under the|united|state have be a member of the|general|convention and know the principle on which the constitution be form have ever entertain but opinion on this subject and from the first establishment of the government to this moment conduct have exemplify that opinion that the power of make treaty be exclusively vest in the president by and with the advice and consent of the senate provide two|third of the senators present concur and that every treaty so make and promulgate thenceforward become the law of the land be thus that the treaty make power have be understand by foreign nations and in all the treaty make with have declare and have believe that when ratify by the president with the advice and consent of the senate become obligatory in this construction of the constitution every house of representatives have heretofore acquiesce and until the present time not a doubt or suspicion have appear to knowledge that this construction be not the true one nay have more than acquiesce for till now without controvert the obligation of such treaty have make all the requisite provision for carry into effect there be also reason to believe that this construction agree with the opinion entertain by the|state|convention when be deliberate on the constitution especially by those who object to because there be not require in commercial treaty the consent of two|third of the whole number of the member of the senate instead of two|third of the senators present and because in treaty respect territorial and certain other right and claim the concurrence of fourth of the whole number of the member of both house respectively be not make necessary be a fact declare by the|general|convention and universally understand that the|united|state be the result of a spirit of amity and mutual concession and be well know that under this influence the small states be admit to an equal representation in the senate with the large states and that this branch of the government be invest with great power for on the equal participation of those power the sovereignty andpolitical safety of the small states be deem essentially to depend if other proof than these and the plain letter of the constitution be necessary to ascertain the point under consideration may be find in the journal of the|general|convention which have deposit in the office of the department of state in these journal will appear that a proposition be make that no treaty should be bind on the|united|state which be not ratify by a law and that the proposition be explicitly reject as therefore be perfectly clear to understanding that file assent of the|house|of|representatives be not necessary to the validity of a treaty as the treaty with great|britain exhibit in all the object require legislative provision and on these the paper call for can throw no light and as be essential to the due administration of the government that the boundary fix by the constitution between the different department should be preserve a just regard to the constitution and to the duty of office under all the circumstance of this case forbid a complyance with request transcript trust do not deceive when indulge the persuasion that have never meet at any period when more than at the present the situation of public affair have afford just cause for mutual congratulation and for invite to join with in profound gratitude to the author of all good for the numerous and extraordinary blessing enjoy the termination of the long expensive and distress war in which have be engage with certain indians northwest of the ohio be place in the option of the|united|state by a treaty which the commander of army have conclude provisionally with the hostile tribe in that region in the adjustment of the term the satisfaction of the indians be deem worthy no less of the policy than of the liberality of the|united|state as the necessary basis of durable tranquillity the object be believe have be fully attain the article agree upon will immediately be lay before the senate for consideration the creek and cherokee|indians who alone of the southern tribe have annoy frontier have lately confirm preexist treaty with and be give evidence of a sincere disposition to carry into effect by the surrender of the prisoner and property have take but have to lament that the fair prospect in this|quarter have be once more clouded by wanton murder which some citizen of georgia be represent to have recently perpetrate on hunt party of the creeks which have again subject that frontier to disquietude and danger which will be productive of further expense and may occasion more effusion of blood measure be pursue to prevent or mitigate the usual consequence of such outrage and with the hope of succeed at least to avert general hostility a letter from the emperor of morocco announce to recognition of treaty make with father the late emperor and consequently the continuance of peace with that power with peculiar satisfaction add that information have be receive from an agent depute on part to algiers import that the term of the treaty with the day and regency of that country have be adjust in such a manner as to authorize the expectation of a speedy peace and the resolution of unfortunate fellow citizen from a grievous captivity the late advice from envoy at give moreover the pleasing information that have assurance of a speedy and satisfactory conclusion of negotiation while the event depend upon unadjusted particular can not be regard as ascertain be agreeable to cherish the expectation of an issue which secure amicably very essential interest of the|united|state will at the same time lie the foundation of last harmony with a power whose friendship have uniformly and sincerely desire to cultivate though not before officially disclose to the|house|of|representatives gentleman be all apprise that a treaty of amity commerce and navigation have be negotiate with great|britain and that the senate have advise and consent to ratification upon a condition which except part of article agreeably thereto and to the good judgment be able to form of the public interest after full and mature deliberation have add sanction the result on the part of his|britannic|majesty be unknown when receive the subject will without delay be place before congress this interesting summary of affair with regard to the foreign power between whom and the|united|stat controversy have subsist and with regard also to those of indian neighbor with whom have be in a state of enmity or misunderstanding open a wide field for consoling and gratify reflection if by prudence and moderation on every side the extinguishment of all the cause of external discord which have heretofore menace tranquillity on term compatible with national right and honor shall be the happy result how firm and how precious a foundation will have be lay for accelerate mature and establish the prosperity of country contemplate the internal situation as well as the external relation of the|united|state discover equal cause for contentment and satisfaction while many of the nation of europe with american dependency have be involve in a contest unusually bloody exhausting and calamitous in which the evil of foreign war have be aggravate by domestic convulsion and insurrection in which many of the art most useful to society have be expose to discouragement and decay in which scarcity of subsistence have imbittere other suffering while even the anticipation of a return of the blessing of peace and repose be alloy by the sense of heavy and

tranquillity the more satisfactory because maintain at the expense of no duty faithful to have violate no obligation to other agriculture commerce and manufacture prosper beyond former example the molestation of trade to prevent a continuance of which however very pointed remonstrance have be make be overbalance by the aggregate benefit which derive from a neutral position population advance with a celerity which exceed the most sanguine calculation proportionally augment strength and resource and guarantee future security every part of the union display indication of rapid and various

offender here refer to and to extend forgiveness to those who have be adjudge to capital punishment for though shall always think a sacred duty to exercise with firmness and energy the constitutional power with which be vest yet appear to no less consistent with the public good than be with personal feeling to mingle in the operation of government every degree of moderation and tenderness which

to the character of government and to stability which can not be shake by the enemy of order freely to unfold the course of this event during the session of the|year|one|thousand|seven|hundred|and|ninety be expedient to exercise the legislative power grant by the constitution of the|united|state to lay and collect excise in a majority of the states scarcely an objection be hear to this mode of taxation in some indeed alarm be at first conceive until be banish by reason and patriotism in the western county of pennsylvania a prejudice foster and embitter by the artifice of man who labor for an ascendency over the will of other by the guidance of passion produce symptom of riot and violence be well know that congress do not hesitate to examine the complaint which be present and to relieve as far as justice dictate or general convenience would permit but the impression which this moderation make on the discontent do not correspond with what deserve the art of delusion be no longer confine to the effort of design individual the very forbearance to press prosecution be misinterpret into a fear of urge the execution of the law and association of man begin to denounce threat against the officer employ from a belief that by a more formal concert operation may be defeat certain self create society assume the tone of condemnation hence while the great part of pennsylvania be conform to the act of excise a few county be resolve to frustrate be now perceive that every expectation from the tenderness which have be hitherto pursue be unavaile and that further delay could only create an opinion of impotency or irresolution in the government legal process be therefore deliver to the marshal against the rioter and delinquent distiller no sooner be understand to be engage in this duty than the vengeance of armed man be aim at person and the person and property of the inspector of the revenue fire upon the marshal arrest and detain for some time as a prisoner be oblige by the jeopardy of life to renounce the service of other process on the west side of the allegeny mountain and a deputation be afterwards send to to demand a surrender of that which have serve a numerous body repeatedly attack the house of the inspector seize paper of office and finally destroy by fire building and whatsoever contain both of these officer from a just regard to safety flee to the seat of government be avow that the motif to such outrage be to compel the resignation of the inspector to withstand by force of arm the authority of

the|united|state notify to that in the county of washington and allegeny in pennsylvania law of the|united|state be oppose and the execution thereof obstruct by combination too powerful to be suppress by the ordinary course of judicial proceeding or by the power vest in the marshal of that district on this call momentous in the extreme seek and weigh what may best subdue the crisis on the hand the judiciary be pronounce to be strip of capacity to enforce the law crime which reach the very existence of social order be perpetrate without controul the friend of government be insult abuse and overawe into silence or an apparent acquiescence and the yield to the treasonable fury of so small a portion of the|united|state would be to violate the fundamental principle of constitution which enjoin that the will of the majority shall prevail on the other to array citizen against citizen to publish the dishonor of such excess to encounter the expense and other embarrassment of so distant an expedition be step too delicate too closely interwoven with many affect consideration to be lightly adopt postpone therefore the summoning of the militia immediately into the field but require to be hold in readiness that if anxious endeavour to reclaim the deluded and to convince the malignant of danger should be fruitless military force may be prepared to act before the season should be too far advanced proclamation of the|7th|of|august|last be accordingly issue and accompany by the appointment of commissioners who be charge to repair to the scene of insurrection be authorize to confer with any body of man or individual be instruct to be candid and explicit in state the sensation which have be excite in the executive and earnest wish to avoid a resort to coercion to represent however that without submission coercion must be the resort but to invite at the same time to return to the demeanor of faithful citizen by such accommodation as lie within the sphere of the executive power pardon too be tender to by the government of the|united|state and that of pennsylvania upon no other condition than a satisfactory assurance of obedience to the law although the report of the commissioner mark firmness and ability and must unite all virtuous man by shew that the mean of conciliation have be exhaust all of those who have commit or abet the tumult do not subscribe the mild form which be propose as the atonement and the indication of a peaceable temper be neither sufficiently general nor conclusive to recommend or warrant a further suspension of the march of the militia thus the painful alternative could not be discard order the militia to march after once more admonish the insurgent in proclamation of the|25th|of|september last be a task too difficult to ascertain with precision the low degree of force competent to the quelling of the insurrection from a respect indeed to oeconomy and the ease of fellow citizen belong to the militia would have gratify to accomplish such an estimate very reluctance to ascribe too much importance to the opposition have extent be accurately see would have be a decide inducement to the small efficient number in this uncertainty therefore put in motion fifteen|thousand man as be an army which accord to all human calculation would be prompt and adequate in every view and may perhaps by render resistance desperate prevent the effusion of blood quotas have be assign to the state of new jersey pennsylvania maryland and virginia the governor of pennsylvania have declare on this occasion an opinion which justify a requisition to the other state as commander in chief of the militia when call into the actual service of the|united|state have visit the place of general rendezvous to obtain more exact information and to direct a plan for ulterior movement have there be room for a persuasion that the law be secure from obstruction that the civil magistrate be able to bring to justice such of the most culpable as have not embrace the proffered term of amnesty and may be deem fit object of example that the friend to peace and good government be not in need of that aid and countenance which ought always to receive and trust ever will receive against the vicious and turbulent should have catch with avidity the opportunity of restore the militia to family and home but succeed intelligence have tend to manifest the necessity of what have be do be now confess by those who be not incline to exaggerate the ill conduct of the insurgent that malevolence be not point merely to a particular law but that a spirit inimical to all order have actuate many of the offender if the state of thing have afford reason for the continuance of presence with the army would not have be withholden but every appearance assure such an issue as will redound to the reputation and strength of the|united|state have judge most proper to resume duty at the seat of government leave the chief command with the governor of virginia still however as be probable that in a commotion like the present whatsoever may be the pretence the purpose of mischief and revenge may not be lay aside the stationing of a small force for a certain period in the western county of pennsylvania will be indispensable whether contemplate the situation of those who be connect with the execution of the law or of other who may have expose by an honorable attachment to thirty|day from the commencement of this session be the legal limitation of the employment of the militia congress can not be too early occupy with this subject among the discussion which may arise from this aspect of affair and from the document which will be submit to congress will not escape observation that not only the inspector of the revenue but other officer of the|united|state in pennsylvania have from fidelity in the discharge of function sustain material injury to property the obligation and policy of indemnify be strong and obvious may also merit attention whether policy will not enlarge this provision to the retribution of other citizen who though not under the tie of office may have suffer damage by generous exertion for uphold the constitution and the law the amount even if all the injure be include would not be great and on future emergency the government would be amply repay by the influence of an example that who incur a loss in defence shall find a recompense in liberality while there be cause to lament that occurrence of this nature should have disgrace the name or interrupt the tranquillity of any part of community or should have divert to a new application any portion of the public resource there be not want real and substantial consolation for the misfortune have demonstrate that prosperity rest on solid foundation by furnish an additional proof that fellow citizen understand the true principle of government and liberty that feel inseparable union that notwithstanding all the device which have be use to sway from interest and duty be now as ready to maintain the authority of the law against licentious invasion as be to defend right against usurpation have be a spectacle display to the high advantage the value of republican|government to behold the most and least wealthy of citizen stand in the same rank as private soldier pre - eminently distinguish by be the army of the constitution undeterred by a march of three|hundred|miles over rugged mountain by the approach of an inclement season or by any other discouragement nor ought to omit to acknowledge the efficacious and patriotic co - operation which have experience from the chief magistrate of the state to which requisition have be address to every description indeed of citizen let praise be give but let persevere in affectionate vigilance over that precious depository of american happiness the constitution of the|united|state let cherish too for the sake of those who from every clime be daily seek a dwelling in land and when in the calm moment of reflection shall have retrace the origin and progress of the insurrection let determine whether have not be foment by combination of man who careless of consequence and disregard the unerring truth that those who rouse can not always appease a civil convulsion have disseminate from an ignorance or version of fact suspicion jealousy and accusation of the whole government have thus fulfil the engagement which take when enter into office to the good of ability to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the|united|state on gentlemen and the people by whom be depute rely for support in the arrangement to which the possibility of a similar contingency will naturally draw attention ought not to be forget that the militia law have exhibit such striking defect as could not have be supply but by the zeal of citizen besides the extraordinary expense and waste which be not the least of the defect every appeal to those law be attend with a doubt of success the devising and establishing of a well regulated militia would be a genuine source of legislative honor and a perfect title to public gratitude therefore entertain a hope that the present session will not pass without carry to full energy the power of organizing arming and discipline the militia and thus provide in the language of the constitution for call forth to execute the law of the union suppress insurrection and repel invasion as auxiliary to the state of defence to which congress can never too frequently recur will not omit to enquire whether the fortification which have be already license by law be commensurate with exigency the intelligence from the army under the command of general wayne be a happy presage to military operation against the hostile indians north of the ohio from the advice which have be forward the advance which have make must have damp the ardor of the savage and weaken obstinacy in wag war against the|united|state and yet even at this|late|hour when power to punish can not be question shall not be unwilling to cement a lasting peace upon term of candor equity and good neighborhood towards none of the indian tribe have overture of friendship be spare the creeks in particular be cover from encroachment by the interposition of the|general|government and that of georgia from a desire also to remove the discontent of the|six|nation a settlement meditate at presqu'isle on lake|erie have be suspend and an agent be now endeavor to rectify any misconception into which may have fall but can not refrain from again press upon deliberation the plan which recommend at the last session for the improvement of harmony with all the indians within limit by the fix and conducting of trading house upon the principle then express gentleman of the|house|of|representatives the time which have elapse since the commencement of fiscal measure have develop pecuniary resource so as to open a way for a definitive plan for the redemption of the public debt be believe that the result be such as to encourage congress to consummate this work without delay nothing can more promote the permanent welfare of the nation and nothing would be more grateful to constituent indeed whatsoever be unfinished of system of public credit can not be benefit by procrastination and as far as may be practicable ought to place that credit on ground which can not be disturb and to prevent that progressive accumulation of debt which must ultimately endanger all government an estimate of the necessary appropriation include the expenditure into which have be drive by the insurrection will be submit to congress gentleman of the senate and of the|house|of|representatives the mint of the|united|state have enter upon the coinage of the precious metal and considerable sum of defective coin and bullion have be lodge with the director by individual there be a pleasing prospect that the institution will at no remote day realize the expectation which be originally form of utility in subsequent communication certain circumstance of intercourse with foreign nation will be transmit to congress however may not be unseasonable to announce that policy in foreign transaction have be to cultivate peace with all the world to observe treaty with pure and absolute faith to check every deviation from the line of impartiality to explain what may have be misapprehend and correct what may have be injurious to any nation and have thus acquire the right to lose no time in acquire the ability to insist upon justice be do to let unite therefore in implore the|supreme|rule of nation to spread holy protection over these|united|states to turn the machination of the wicked to the confirming of constitution to enable at all time to root out internal sedition and put invasion to flight to perpetuate to country that prosperity which goodness have already confer and to verify the anticipation of this government be a safe guard to human right transcript whereas from a hope that the combination against the constitution and law of the|united|state in certain of the western county of pennsylvania would yield to time and reflection think sufficient in the first instance rather to take measure for call forth the militia than immediately to embody but the moment be now come when the overture of forgiveness with no other condition than a submission to law have be only partially accept when every form of conciliation not inconsistent with the being of government have be adopt without effect when the well dispose in those county be unable by influence and example to reclaim the wicked from fury and be compel to associate in own defence when the proffered lenity have be perversely misinterpret into an apprehension that the citizen will march with reluctance when the opportunity of examine the serious consequence of a treasonable opposition have be employ in propagating principle of anarchy endeavor through emissary to alienate the friend of order from support and invite enemy to perpetrate similar act of insurrection when be manifest that violence would continue to be exercise upon every attempt to enforce the law when therefore government be set at defiance the contest be whether a small proportion of the|united|state shall dictate to the whole union and at the expense of those who desire peace indulge a desperate ambition now therefore george|washington president of the|united|state in obedience to that high and irresistible duty consign to by the constitution to take care that the law be faithfully execute deplore that the american name should be sully by the outrage of citizen on own government commiserate such as remain obstinate from delusion but resolve in perfect reliance on that gracious providence which so signally display goodness towards this country to reduce the refractory to a due subordination to the law do hereby declare and make know that with a satisfaction which can be equal only by the merit of the militia summon into service from the|states|of|new|jersey pennsylvania maryland and virginia have receive intelligence of patriotic alacrity in obey the call of the present though painful yet command necessity that a force which accord to every reasonable expectation be adequate to the exigency be already in motion to the scene of disaffection that those who have confide or shall confide in the protection of government shall meet full succor under the standard and from the arm of the|united|state that those who have offend against the law have since entitle to indemnity will be treat with the most liberal good faith if shall not have forfeit claim by any subsequent conduct and that instruction be give accordingly and do moreover exhort all individual officer and body of man to contemplate with abhorrence the measure lead directly or indirectly to those crime which produce this resort to military coercion to check in respective sphere the effort of misguided or design man to substitute misrepresentation in the place of truth and discontent in the place of stable government and to call to mind that as the people of the|united|state have be permit under the divine favor in perfect freedom after solemn deliberation in an enlighten age to elect own government so will gratitude for this inestimable blessing be best distinguish by firm exertion to maintain the constitution and the law and lastly again warn all person whomsoever and whersoever not to abet aid or comfort the insurgent aforesaid as will answer the contrary at peril and do also require all officer and other citizen accord to several duty as far as may be in power to bring under the cognizance of the law all offender in the premise transcript whereas combination to defeat the execution of the law lay duty upon spirit distil within the|united|state and upon still have from the time of the commencement of those law exist in some of the western part of pennsylvania and whereas the say combination proceed in a manner subversive equally of the just authority of government and of the right of individual have hitherto effect dangerous and criminal

to deter those who may be so disposed from accept office under through fear of public resentment and of injury to person and property and to compel those who have accept such office by actual violence to surrender or forbear the execution of by circulate vindictive menace against all those who should otherwise directly or indirectly aid in the execution of the say law or who yield to the dictate of conscience and to a sense of obligation should comply therewith by actually injure and destroy the property of person who be understand to have so comply by inflict cruel and humiliating punishment upon private citizen for no other cause than that of appear to be the friend of the law by intercept the public officer on the highway abuse assault and otherwise ill treat by go to house in the|night gain admittance by force take away paper and commit other outrage employ for these unwarrantable purpose the agency of armed banditti disguise in such manner as for the most part to escape discovery and whereas the endeavor of the legislature to obviate objection to the say law by lower the duty and by other alteration conducive to the convenience of those whom immediately affect though have give satisfaction in other|quarters and the endeavor of the executive officer to conciliate a compliance with the law by explanation by forbearance and even by particular accommodation round on the suggestion of local consideration have be disappoint of effect by the machination of person whose industry to excite resistance have increase with every appearance of a disposition among the people to

government which while contribute to the security of the people serve also to guard against the effect of misrepresentation and misconception the establishment of additional cross - post especially to some of the important point in the western and northern part of the union can not fail to be of material utility the disorder in the exist currency and especially the scarcity of small change a
