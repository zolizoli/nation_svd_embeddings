consent to exercise the willful use of such power if continue through a|period|of|year would have endanger the purity of the general administration and thelibertie of the states which remain loyal besides the policy of military rule over a conquered territory wouldhave imply that the states whose inhabitant may have take part in therebellion have by the act of those inhabitant cease to exist but thetrue theory be that all pretend act of secession be from the beginningnull and void the states can not commit treason nor screen the individualcitizen who may have commit treason any more than can make validtreatie or engage in lawful commerce with any foreign power the statesattempting to secede place in a condition where vitalitywas impair but not extinguish function suspend but

require at least the acquiescence of the states which itconcern that imply an invitation to those states by renew theirallegiance to the|united|state to resume function as states ofthe union but be a risk that must be take in the choice of difficultiesit be the small risk and to diminish and if possible to remove alldanger have feel incumbent on to assert other power of thegeneral government the power of pardon as no state can throw a defenseover the crime of treason the power of pardon be exclusively vest inthe executive government of the|united|state in exercise that poweri have take every precaution to connect with the clear recognitionof the bind force of the law of the|united|state and an unqualifiedacknowledgment of the great social change of condition in regard to slaverywhich have grow out of the war the next step which have take to restore the constitutional relationsof the states have be an invitation to to participate in the highoffice of amend the constitution every patriot must wish for a generalamnesty at the early epoch consistent with public safety for this greatend there be need of a concurrence of all opinion and the spirit of mutualconciliation all party in the late terrible conflict must work togetherin harmony be not too much to ask in the name of the whole people that on the side the plan of restoration shall proceed in conformitywith a willingness to cast the disorder of the past into oblivion andthat on the other the evidence of sincerity in the future maintenance ofthe union shall be put beyond any doubt by the ratification of the proposedamendment to the constitution which provide for the abolition of slaveryforever within the limit of country so long as the adoption of thisamendment be delay so long will doubt and jealousy and uncertainty prevail this be the measure which will efface the sad memory of the past thisis the measure which will most certainly call population and capital andsecurity to those part of the union that need most indeed isnot too much to ask of the states which be now resume place inthe family of the union to give this pledge of perpetual loyalty and peace until be do the past however much may desire will not be forget the adoption of the amendment reunite beyond all power of disruption;it heal the wound that be still imperfectly closed remove slavery the element which have so long perplex and divide the country makesof once more a united people renew and strengthen bind more thanever to mutual affection and support the amendment to the constitution be adopt would remain forthe states whose power have be so long in abeyance to resume placesin the branch of the|national|legislature and thereby complete thework of restoration here be for fellow citizen of the senate and for fellow citizen of the|house|of|representatives to judge each of for yourself of the election return and qualificationsof own member the full assertion of the power of requiresthe holding of circuit court of the|united|state within the districtswhere authority have be interrupt in the present posture of ourpublic affair strong objection have be urge to hold those courtsin any of the states where the rebellion have exist and be ascertainedby inquiry that the circuit court of the|united|state would not be heldwithin the district of virginia during the autumn or early|winter noruntil congress should have an opportunity to consider and act on the wholesubject to deliberation the restoration of this branch of the civilauthority of the|united|state be therefore necessarily refer withthe hope that early provision will be make for the resumption of all itsfunction be manifest that treason most flagrant in character hasbeen commit person who be charge with commission should havefair and impartial trial in the high civil tribunal of the country in order that the constitution and the law may be fully vindicate thetruth dearly establish and affirm that treason be a crime that traitorsshould be punish and the offense make infamous and at the same time that the question may be judicially settle finally and forever thatno state of own will have the right to renounce place in the union the relation of the|general|government toward the inhabitantswhom the war have call into freedom have engage most serious consideration on the propriety of attempt to make the freedman elector by the proclamationof the executive take for counsel the constitution the interpretationsof that instrument by author and contemporary and recentlegislation by congress when at the first movement toward independence the congress of the|united|state instruct the several states to institutegovernment of own leave each state to decide for thecondition for the enjoyment of the elective franchise during the periodof the confederacy there continue to exist a very great diversity in thequalification of elector in the several states and even within a statea distinction of qualification prevail with regard to the officer whowere to be choose the|constitution|of the|united|states recognize thesediversitie when enjoin that in the choice of member of the|houseof|representatif of the|united|state the elector in each state shallhave the qualification requisite for elector of the most numerous branchof the state legislature after the formation of the constitution remain as before the uniform usage for each state to enlarge the body of itselector accord to own judgment and under this system stateafter another have proceed to increase the number of elector untilnow universal suffrage or something very near be the general rule so fix be this reservation of power in the habit of the people andso unquestioned have be the interpretation of the constitution that duringthe civil war the late president never harbor the purpose certainlynever evowe the purpose of disregard and in the act of congressduring that period nothing can be find which during the continuance ofhostilitie much less after close would have sanction any departureby the executive from a policy which have so uniformly obtain moreover a concession of the elective franchise to the freedman by act of the|presidentof|the|united|state must have be extend to all colored man whereverfound and so must have establish a change of suffrage in the northern middle and western|states not less than in the southern and southwestern such an act would have create a new class of voter and would have beenan assumption of power by the president which nothing in the constitutionor law of the|united|state would have warrant on the other hand every danger of conflict be avoid when the settlementof the question be refer to the several states can each for decide on the measure and whether be to be adopt at once and absolutelyor introduce gradually and with condition in judgment the freedman if show patience and manly virtue will sooner obtain a participationin the elective franchise through the states than through the|general|government even if have power to intervene when the tumult of emotion that havebeen raise by the suddenness of the social change shall have subside may prove that will receive the kind usage from some of thoseon whom have heretofore most closely depended but while have no doubt that now after the close of the war isnot competent for the|general|government to extend the elective franchisein the several states be equally clear that good faith require thesecurity of the freedman in liberty and property rightto labor and right to claim the just return of labor can not too strongly urge a dispassionate treatment of this subject whichshould be carefully keep aloof from all party strife must equally avoidhasty assumption of any natural impossibility for the race to liveside by side in a state of mutual benefit and good will the experimentinvolve in no inconsistency let then go on and make that experimentin good faith and not be too easily dishearten the country be in needof labor and the freedman be in need of employment culture and protection while right of voluntary migration and expatriation be not to bequestione would not advise force removal and colonization letus rather encourage to honorable and useful industry where maybe beneficial to and to the country and instead of hasty anticipationsof the certainty of failure let there be nothing want to the fair trialof the experiment the change in condition be the substitution oflabor by contract for the status of slavery the freedman can not fairlybe accuse of unwillingness to work so long as a doubt remain about hisfreedom of choice in pursuit and the certainty of recover hisstipulated wage in this the interest of the employer and the employedcoincide the employer desire in workman spirit and alacrity andthese can be permanently secure in no other way and if the oughtto be able to enforce the contract so ought the other the public interestwill be best promote if the several states will provide adequate protectionand remedy for the freedman until this be in some way accomplish therei no chance for the advantageous use of labor and the blame ofill success will not rest on know that sincere philanthropy be earnest for the immediate realizationof remote aim but time be always an element in reform be oneof the great act on record to have bring people into freedom the career of free industry must be fairly open to and then theirfuture prosperity and condition must after all rest mainly on if fail and so perish away let be careful that the failure shallnot be attributable to any denial of justice in all that relate to thedestiny of the freedman need not be too anxious to read the future;many incident which from a speculative point of view may raise alarmwill quietly settle now that slavery be at an end or nearit end the greatness of evil in the point of view of public economybecome more and more apparent slavery be essentially a monopoly of labor and as such lock the states where prevail against the incoming offree industry where labor be the property of the capitalist the whiteman be exclude from employment or have but the second good

those region will be people by a numerous and enterprise population which will vie with any in the union in compactness inventive genius wealth and industry government spring from and be make for the people not the peoplefor the government to owe allegiance from must deriveit courage strength and wisdom but while the government be thus boundto defer to the people from whom derive existence should from the very consideration of origin be strong in power of resistanceto the establishment of inequality monopoly perpetuity and classlegislation be contrary to the genius of free government and ought notto be allow here there be no room for favor class or monopolies;the principle of government be that of equal law and freedom of industry wherever monopoly attain a foothold be sure to be a source of danger discord and trouble shall but fulfill duty as legislator byaccorde equal and exact justice to all man special privilege to none the government be subordinate to the people but as the agent

of congress soas to prevent any selfish impediment to the free circulation of man andmerchandise a tax on travel and merchandise in transit constitutesone of the bad form of monopoly and the evil be

should manifest by furnish would win forbearance and favor toward the colony from all civilized nation the propose overland telegraph between america and europe by the way of behrings|strait and asiatic|russia which be sanction by congress at the last session have be undertake under very favorable circumstance by an association of american citizen with the cordial good will and support as well of this government as of those of great|britain and russia assurance have be receive from most of the|south|american|state of high appreciation of the enterprise and readiness to cooperate in construct line tributary to that world encircle communication learn with much satisfaction that the noble design of a telegraphic communication between the eastern coast of america and great|britain have be renew with full expectation of early accomplishment thus be hope that with the return of domestic peace the country will be able to resume with energy and advantage former high career of commerce and civilization very popular and estimable representative in egypt die in april last an unpleasant altercation which arise between the temporary incumbent of the office and the|government|of|the|pasha result in a suspension of intercourse the evil be promptly correct on the arrival of the successor in the consulate and relation with egypt as well as relation with the|barbary|power be entirely satisfactory the rebellion which have so long be flagrant in china have at last be suppress with the cooperate good office of this government and of the other western commercial states the judicial consular establishment there have become very difficult and onerous and will need legislative revision to adapt to the extension of commerce and to the more intimate intercourse which have be institute with the government and people of that vast empire china seem to be accept with hearty good will the conventional law which regulate commercial and social intercourse among the western nation owe to the peculiar situation of japan and the anomalous form of government the action of that empire in perform treaty stipulation be inconstant and capricious nevertheless good progress have be effect by the western power move with enlightened concert own pecuniary claim have be allow or put in course of settlement and the inland sea have be reopen to commerce there be reason also to believe that these proceeding have increase rather than diminish the friendship of japan toward the|united|state the port of norfolk fernandina and pensacola have be open by proclamation be hope that foreign merchant will now consider whether be not safe and more profitable to as well as just to the|united|state to resort to these and other open port than be to pursue through many hazard and at vast cost a contraband trade with other port which be close if not by actual military occupation at least by a lawful and effective blockade for have no doubt of the power and duty of the executive under the law of nation to exclude enemy of the human race from an asylum in the|united|state if congress should think that proceeding in such case lack the authority of law or ought to be further regulate by recommend that provision be make for effectually prevent foreign slave trader from acquire domicile and facility for criminal occupation in country be possible that if be new and open question the maritime power with the light now enjoy would not concede the privilege of a naval belligerent to the insurgent of the|united|state destitute as be and always have be equally of ship of war and of port and harbor disloyal emissary have be neither less assiduous nor more successful during the|last|year than be before that time in effort under favor of that privilege to embroil country in foreign war the desire and determination of the government of the maritime state to defeat that design be believe to be as sincere as and can not be more earnest than own nevertheless unforeseen political difficulty have arise especially in brazilian and british port and on the northern boundary of the|united|state which have require and be likely to continue to require the practice of constant vigilance and a just and conciliatory spirit on the part of the|united|state as well as of the nation concern and government commissioner have be appoint under the treaty with great|britain on the adjustment of the claim of the|hudsons|bay|and|pugets|sound|agricultural|companie in oregon and be now proceed to the execution of the trust assign to in view of the insecurity of life and property in the region adjacent to the canadian border by reason of recent assault and depredation commit by inimical and desperate person who be harbor there have be think proper to give notice that after the expiration of six|month the period conditionally stipulate in the exist arrangement with great|britain the|united|states must hold at liberty to increase naval armament upon the lakes if shall find that proceed necessary the condition of the border will necessarily come into consideration in connection with the question of continue or modify the right of transit from canada through the|united|state as well as the regulation of impost which be temporarily establish by the reciprocity treaty of the 5th june,|1854 desire however to be understand while make this statement that the colonial authority of canada be not deem to be intentionally unjust or unfriendly toward the|united|state but on the contrary there be every reason to expect that with the approval of the|imperial|government will take the necessary measure to prevent new incursion across the border the act pass at the last session for the encouragement of immigration have so far as be possible be put into operation seem to need amendment which will enable the officer of the government to prevent the practice of fraud against the immigrant while on way and on arrival in the port so as to secure here a free choice of avocation and place of settlement a liberal disposition toward this great national policy be manifest by most of the|european|states and ought to be reciprocate on part by give the immigrant effective national protection regard immigrant as of the principal replenishing stream which be appoint by providence to repair the ravage of internal war and waste of national strength and health all that be necessary be to secure the flow of that stream in present fullness and to that end the government must in every way make manifest that neither need nor design to impose involuntary military service upon those who come from other land to cast lot in country the financial affair of the government have be successfully administer during the|last|year the legislation of the last session of congress have beneficially affect the revenue although sufficient time have not yet elapse to experience the full effect of several of the provision of the act of congress impose increase taxation the receipt during the|year from all source upon the basis of warrant sign by the secretary of the treasury include loan and the balance in the treasury on the|1st|day|of|july,|1863 be and the aggregate disbursement upon the same basis be leave a balance in the treasury as show by warrant of deduct from these amount the amount of the principal of the public debt redeem and the amount of issue in substitution therefor and the actual cash operation of the treasury be receipt disbursement 865,234,087.86 which leave a cash balance in the treasury of of the receipt there be derive from custom from lands|$588,333.29 from direct taxis from internal revenue 109,741,134.10 from miscellaneous source and from loan apply to actual expenditure include former balance 623,443,929.13 there be disburse for the civil service for pension and indians for the war|department for the navy|department for interest on the public debt make an aggregate of 865,234,087.86 and leave a balance in the treasury of as before state for the actual receipt and disbursement for the|first|quarter and the estimate receipt and disbursement for the remain quarter of the|current|fiscal|year and the general operation of the treasury in detail refer to the report of the secretary of the treasury concur with in the opinion that the proportion of money require to meet the expense consequent upon the war derive from taxation should be still further increase and earnestly invite attention to this subject to the end that there may be such additional legislation as shall be require to meet the just expectation of the secretary the public debt on the|1st|day|of|july|last as appear by the book of the treasury amount to probably should the war continue for another|year that amount may be increase by not far from five|hundred|millions hold as be for the most part by own people have become a substantial branch of national though private property for obvious reason the more nearly this property can be distribute among all the people the better to favor such general distribution great inducement to become owner may perhaps with good effect and without injury be present to person of limited mean with this view suggest whether may not be both competent and expedient for congress to provide that a limited amount of some future issue of public security may be hold by any bona fide purchaser exempt from taxation and from seizure for debt under such restriction and limitation as may be necessary to guard against abuse of so important a privilege this would enable every prudent person to set aside a small annuity against a possible day of want privilege like these would render the possession of such security to the amount limit most desirable to every person of small mean who may be able to save enough for the purpose the great advantage of citizen be creditor as well as debtor with relation to the public debt be obvious man readily perceive that can not be much oppress by a debt which owe to the public debt on the|1st|day|of|july|last although somewhat exceed the estimate of the secretary of the treasury make to congress

the|united|state no bank of issue not authorize by congress and no bank note circulation not secure by the government that the government and the people will derive great benefit from this change in the banking system of the country can hardly be question the national system will create a reliable and permanent influence in support of the national credit and protect the people against loss in the use of paper money whether or not any further legislation be advisable for the suppression of state bank issue will be for congress to determine seem quite clear that the treasury can not be satisfactorily conduct unless the government can exercise a restrain power over the bank note circulation of the country the report of the secretary of war and the accompany document will detail the campaign of the army in the field since the date of the last annual message and also the operation of the several administrative bureaus of the|war|department during the|last|year will also specify

the|postmaster general on the subject of special grant by the government in aid of the establishment of new line of ocean mail steamship and the policy recommend for the development of increase commercial intercourse with adjacent and neighboring country should receive the careful consideration of congress be of noteworthy interest that the steady expansion of population improvement and

the entire energy of the nation the organization and admission of the|state|of|nevada have be complete in conformity with law and thus excellent system be firmly establish in the mountain which once

to advance be peculiarly the people 's department in which feel more directly concerned than in any other commend to the continue attention and fostering care of congress the war continue since the last annual message all the important line and position then occupy by force have be maintain and arm have steadily advanced thus liberate the region leave in rear so that missouri kentucky tennessee and part of other states have again produce reasonably fair crop the most remarkable feature in the military operation of the|year be general sherman 's attempt march of directly through the insurgent region tend to show a great increase of relative strength that general in chief should feel able to confront and hold in check every active force of the enemy and yet to detach a well appoint large army to move on such an expedition the result not yet be know conjecture in regard to be not here indulge important movement have also occur during the|year to the effect of mold society for durability in the union although short of complete success be much in the fight direction that citizen in each of the|states|of|arkansas and louisiana have organize loyal state government with free constitution and be earnestly struggle to maintain and administer the movement in the same direction more extensive though less definite in missouri kentucky and tennessee should not be overlook but maryland present the example of complete success maryland be secure to liberty and union for all the future the genius of rebellion will no more claim maryland like another foul spirit be drive out may seek to tear but will woo no more at the last session of congress a propose amendment of the constitution abolish slavery throughout the|united|state pass the senate but fail for lack of the requisite third vote in the|house|of|representatives although the present be the same congress and nearly the same member and without question the wisdom or patriotism of those who stand in opposition venture to recommend the reconsideration and passage of the measure at the present session of course the abstract question be not change but in intervene election show almost certainly that the next congress will pass the measure if this do not hence there be only a question of time as to when the propose amendment will go to the states for action and as be to so go at all event may not agree that the sooner the well be not claim that the election have impose a duty on member to change view or vote any further than as an additional element to be consider judgment may be affect by be the voice of the people now for the first time hear upon the question in a great national crisis like ours unanimity of action among those seek a common end be very desirable — almost indispensable and yet no approach to such unanimity be attainable unless some deference shall be pay to the will of the majority simply because be the will of the majority in this case the common end be the maintenance of the union and among the mean to secure that end such will through the election be most dearly declare in favor of such constitutional amendment the most reliable indication of public purpose in this country be derive through popular election judge by the recent canvass and result the purpose of the people within the loyal states to maintain the integrity of the union be never more firm nor more nearly unanimous than now the extraordinary calmness and good order with which the million of voter meet and mingle at the poll give strong assurance of this not only all those who support the union ticket so call but a great majority of the oppose party also may be fairly claim to entertain and to be actuate by the same purpose be an unanswerable argument to this effect that no candidate for any officce whatever high or low have venture to seek vote on the avowal that be for give up the union there have be much impugning of motif and much heated controversy as to the proper mean and good mode of advance the union cause but on the distinct issue of union|or no union the politician have show instinctive knowledge that there be no diversity among the people in afford the people the fair opportunity of show to another and to the world this firmess and unanimity of purpose the election have be of vast value to the national cause the election have exhibit another tact not less valuable to be know the fact that do not approach exhaustion in the most important branch of national resource that of live man while be melancholy to reflect that the war have fill so many grave and carry mourn to so many heart be some relief to know that compare with the surviving the fall have be so few while corp and division and brigade and regiment have form and fight and dwindle and go out of existence a great majority of the man who compose be still live the same be true of the naval service the election return prove this so many voter could not else be find the states regularly hold election both now and to wit california connecticut delaware illinois indiana iowa kentucky maine maryland massachusetts michigan minnesota missouri new|hampshire new|jersey new|york ohio oregon pennsylvania rhode|island vermont west|virginia and wisconsin east vote now against cast then show an aggregate now of to this be to be add cast now in the new states of kansas and nevada which states do not vote in thus swell the aggregate to and the net increase during of war to a table be append show particular to this again should be add the number of all soldier in the field from massachusetts rhode|island new|jersey delaware indiana illinois and california who by the law of those states could not vote away from home and which number can not be less|than|90,000 nor yet be this all the number in organize territories be triple now what be while thousand white and black join as the national arm press back the insurgent line so much be show affirmatively and negatively by the election be not material to inquire how the increase have be produce or to show that would have be great but for the war which be probably true the important fact remain demonstrate that have more man now than have when the war begin that be not exhaust nor in process of exhaustion that be gain strength and may if nee be maintain the contest indefinitely this as to man material resource be now more complete and abundant than ever the national resource then be unexhausted and as believe inexhaustible the public purpose to reestablish and maintain the national authority be unchanged and as believe unchangeable the manner of continue the effort remain to choose on careful consideration of all the evidence accessible seem to that no attempt at negotiation with the insurgent leader could result in any good would accept nothing short of severance of the union precisely what will not and can not give declaration to this effect be explicit and oft repeat do not attempt to deceive afford no excuse to deceive can not voluntarily reaccept the union can not voluntarily yield between and the issue be distinct simple and inflexible be an issue which can only be try by war and decide by victory if yield be beat if the southern people fail be beat either way would be the victory and defeat follow war what be true however of who head the insurgent cause be not necessarily true of those who follow although can not reaccept the union can some of know already desire peace and reunion the number of such may increase can at any moment have peace simply by lay down arm and submit to the national authority under the constitution alter so much the government could not if would maintain war against the loyal people would not sustain or allow if question should remain would adjust by the peaceful mean of legislation conference court and vote operate only in constitutional and lawful channel some certain and other possible question be and would be beyond the executive power to adjust as for instance the admission of member into congress and whatever may require the appropriation of money the executive power would be greatly diminish by the cessation of actual war pardon and remission of forfeiture however would still be within executive control in what spirit and temper this control would be exercise can be fairly judge of by the past a|year|ago general pardon and amnesty upon specify term be offer to all except certain designate class and be at the same time make known that the except class be still within contemplation of special clemency during the|year many avail of the general provision and many more would only that the sign of bad faith in some lead to such precautionary measure as render the practical process less easy and certain during the same time also special pardon have be grant to individual of the except class and no voluntary application have be deny thus practically the door have be for a|full|year open to all except such as be not in condition to make free choice that is such as be in custody or under constraint be still so open to all but the time may come probably will come when public duty shall demand that be close and that in lieu more rigorous measure than heretofore shall be adopt in present the abandonment of armed resistance to the national authority on the part of the insurgent as the only indispensable condition to end the war on the part of the government retract nothing heretofore say as to slavery repeat the declaration make a|year|a|ago that while remain in present position shall not attempt to retract or modify the emancipation proclamation nor shall return to slavery any person who be free by the term of that proclamation or by any of the act of congress if the people should by whatever mode or mean make an executive duty to reenslave such person another and not must be instrument to perform in state a single condition of peace mean simply to say that the war will cease on the part of the government whenever shall have cease on the part of those who begin transcript fellow citizens of the senate and house|of|representatif another|year of health and of sufficiently abundant harvest have pass for these and especially for the improved condition of national affair renewed and profound gratitude to god be due remain in peace and friendship with foreign power the effort of disloyal citizen of the|united|state to involve in foreign war to aid an inexcusable insurrection have be unavaile britannic|majesty's|government as be justly expect have exercise authority to prevent the departure of new hostile expedition from british port the emperor of france have by a like proceeding promptly vindicate the neutrality which proclaim at the beginning of the contest question of great intricacy and importance have arise out of the blockade and other belligerent operation between the government and several of the maritime power but have be discuss and as far as be possible accommodate in a spirit of frankness justice and mutual good will be especially gratify that prize court by the impartiality of adjudication have command the respect and confidence of maritime power the supplemental treaty between the|united|state and great|britain for the suppression of the african slave trade make on the|17th|day|of|february last have be duly ratify and carry into execution be believe that so far as american port and american citizen be concerned that inhuman and odious traffic have be bring to an end shall submit for the consideration of the senate a convention for the adjustment of possessory claim in washington|territory arise out of the treaty of the|15th|june,|1846 between the|united|state and great|britain and which have be the source of some disquiet among the citizen of that now rapidly improve part of the country a novel and important question involve the extent of the maritime jurisdiction of spain in the water which surround the island of cuba have be debate without reach an agreement and be propose in an amicable spirit to refer to the arbitrament of a friendly power a convention for that purpose will be submit to the senate have think proper subject to the approval of the senate to concur with the interested commercial power in an arrangement for the liquidation of the scheldt due upon the principle which have be heretofore adopt in regard to the impost upon navigation in the water of denmark the long pende controversy between this government and that of chile touch the seizure at sitana in peru by chilean officer of a large amount in treasure belong to citizen of the|united|state have be bring to a close by the award of his|majesty|the|king|of|the|belgians to whose arbitration the question be refer by the party the subject be thoroughly and patiently examine by that justly respect magistrate and although the sum award to the claimant may not have be as large as expect there be no reason to distrust the wisdom of majesty 's decision that decision be promptly comply with by chile when intelligence in regard to reach that country the joint commission under the act of the last session for carry into effect the convention with peru on the subject of claim have be organize at lima and be engage in the business intrust to difficulty concern interoceanic transit through nicaragua be in course of amicable adjustment in conformity with principle set forth in last annual message have receive a representative from and have accredit a minister to that republic incident occur in the progress of civil war have force upon attention the uncertain state of international question touch the right of foreigner in this country and of united|state citizen abroad in regard to some government these right be at least partially define by treaty in no instance however be expressly stipulate that in the event of civil war a foreigner reside in this country within the line of the insurgent be to be exempt from the rule which class as a belligerent in whose behalf the government or country can not expect any privilege or immunity distinct from that character regret to say however that such claim have be put forward and in some instance in behalf of foreigner who have live in the|united|state the great part of life there be reason to believe that many person bear in foreign country who have declare intention to become citizen or who have be fully naturalize have evade the military duty require of by deny the fact and thereby throw upon the government the burden of proof have be find difficult or impracticable to obtain this proof from the want of guide to the proper source of information these may be supply by require clerk of court where declaration of intention may be make or naturalization effect to send periodically list of the name of the person naturalize or declare intention to become citizen to the secretary of the interior in whose department those name may be arrange and print for general information there be also reason to believe that foreigner frequently become citizen of the|united|state for the sole purpose of evading duty impose by the law of native country to which on become naturalize here at once repair and though never return to the|united|state still claim the interposition of this government as citizen many altercation and great prejudice have heretofore arise out of this abuse be therefore submit to serious consideration may be advisable to fix a limit beyond which no citizen of the|united|state reside abroad may claim the interposition of government the right of suffrage have often be assume and exercise by alien under pretense of naturalization which have disavow when draft into the military service submit the expediency of such an amendment of the law as will make the fact of vote an estoppel against any plea of exemption from military service or other civil obligation on the ground of alienage in common with other western power relation with japan have be bring into serious jeopardy through the perverse opposition of the hereditary aristocracy of the empire to the enlightened and liberal policy of the tycoon design to bring the country into the society of nation be hope although not with entire confidence that these difficulty may be peacefully overcome ask attention to the claim of the minister reside there for the damage sustain in the destruction by fire of the residence of the legation at yedo satisfactory arrangement have be make with the emperor of russia which be believe will result in effect a continuous line of telegraph through that empire from pacific|coast recommend to favorable consideration the subject of an international telegraph across the|atlantic|ocean and also of a telegraph between this capital and the national fort along the atlantic seaboard and the|gulf|of|mexico such communication establish with any reasonable outlay would be economical as well as effective aid to the diplomatic military and naval service the consular system of the|united|state under the enactment of the last congress begin to be self sustain and there be reason to hope that may become entirely so with the increase of trade which will ensue whenever peace be restore minister abroad have be faithful in defend american right in protect commercial interest consul have necessarily have to encounter increase labor and responsibility grow out of the war these have for the most part meet and discharge with zeal and efficiency this acknowledgment justly include those consul who reside in morocco egypt turkey japan china and other oriental country be charge with complex function and extraordinary power the condition of the several organize territories be generally satisfactory although indian disturbance in new|mexico have not be entirely suppress the mineral resource of colorado nevada idaho new|mexico and arizona be prove far rich than have be heretofore understand lie before a communication on this subject from the governor of new|mexico again submit to consideration the expediency of establish a system for the encouragement of immigration although this source of national wealth and strength be again flow with great freedom than for several|year before the insurrection occur there be still a great deficiency of laborer in every field of industry especially in agriculture and in mine as well of iron and coal as of the precious metal while the demand for labor be much increase here tens|of|thousand of person destitute of remunerative occupation be throng foreign consulate and offering to emigrate to the|united|states if essential but very cheap assistance can be afford be easy to see that under the sharp discipline of civil war the nation be begin a new life this noble effort demand the aid and ought to receive the attention and support of the government injury unforeseen by the government and unintended may in some case have be inflict on the subject or citizen of foreign country both at sea and on land by person in the service of the|united|state as this government expect redress from other power when similar injury be inflict by person in service upon citizen of the|united|state must be prepared to do justice to foreigner if the exist judicial tribunal be inadequate to this purpose a special court may be authorize with power to hear and decide such claim of the character refer to as may have arise under treaty and the public law convention for adjust the claim by joint commission have be propose to some government but no definitive answer to the proposition have yet be receive from any in the course of the session shall probably have occasion to request to provide indemnification to claimant where decree of restitution have be render and damage award by admiralty court and in other case where this government may be acknowledge to be liable in principle and where the amount of that liability have be ascertain by an informal arbitration the proper officer of the treasury have deem require by the law of the|united|state upon the subject to demand a tax upon the income of foreign consul in this country while such a demand may not in strictness be in derogation of public law or perhaps of any exist treaty between the|united|state and a foreign country the expediency of so far modify the act as to exempt from tax the income of such consul as be not citizen of the|united|state derive from the emolument of office or from property not situate in the|united|state be submit to serious consideration make this suggestion upon the ground that a comity which ought to be reciprocate exempt consul in all other country from taxation to the extent thus indicate the|united|state think ought not to be exceptionally illiberal to international trade and commerce the operation of the treasury during the|last|year have be successfully conduct the enactment by congress of a national banking law have prove a valuable support of the public credit and the general legislation in relation to loan have fully answer the expectation of favorer some amendment may be require to perfect exist law but no change in principle or general scope be believe to be need since these measure have be in operation all demand on the treasury include the pay of the army and navy have be promptly meet and fully satisfied no considerable body of troop be believe be ever more amply provide and more liberally and punctually pay and may be add that by no people be the burden incident to a great war ever more cheerfully bear the receipt during

for the|first|quarter and the estimate receipt and disbursement for the remain three|quarters of the|current|fiscal|year will be show in detail by the report of the secretary of the treasury to which invite attention be sufficient to say here that be not believe that actual result will exhibit a state of the finance less favorable to the country than the estimate of that officer heretofore submit while be confidently expect that at the close of the|year both disbursement and debt will be find very considerably less than have be anticipate the report of the secretary of war be a document of great interest consist the military operation of the|year detail in the report of the general in chief the organization of colored person into the war service the exchange of prisoner fully set forth in the letter of general|hitchcock the operation under the act for enrol and call out the national force detail in the report of the provost marshal general the organization of the invalid corps and the operation of the several department of the quartermaster general commissary- general paymaster general chief of engineers chief of ordnance and surgeon general have appear impossible to make a valuable summary of this report except such as would be too extended for this place and hence content by ask careful attention to the report the duty devolve on the naval branch of the service during the|year and throughout the whole of this unhappy contest have be discharge with fidelity and eminent success the extensive blockade have be constantly increase in efficiency as the navy have expand yet on so long a line have so far be impossible to entirely suppress illicit trade from return receive at the|navy|department appear that more|than|1,000 vessel have be capture since the blockade be institute and that the value of prize already send in for adjudication amount to over|$13,000,000 the naval force of the|united|states consist at this time of vessel complete and in the course of completion and of these be ironclad or armored steamer the event of the war give an increase interest and importance to the navy which will probably extend beyond the war the armored vessel in navy complete and in service or which be under contract and approach completion be believe to exceed in number those of any other power but while these may be rely upon for harbor defense and coast service other of great strength and capacity will be necessary for cruise purpose and to maintain rightful position on the ocean the change that have take place in naval vessel and naval warfare since the introduction of steam as a motive power for ship of war demand either a corresponding change in some of exist navy yard or the establishment of new one for the construction and necessary repair of modern naval vessel no inconsiderable embarrassment delay and public injury have be experience from the want of such governmental establishment the necessity of such a navy yard so furnished at some suitable place upon the atlantic seaboard have on repeat occasion be bring to the attention of congress by the|navy|department and be again present in the report of the secretary which accompany this communication think duty to invite special attention to this subject and also to that of establish a yard and depot for naval purpose upon of the western river a naval force have be create on those interior water and under many disadvantage within little|more|than|two|year exceed in number the whole naval force of the country at the commencement of the present administration satisfactory and important as have be the performance of the heroic man of the navy at this interesting period be scarcely more wonderful than the success of mechanic and artisan in the production of war vessel which have create a new form of naval power country have advantage superior to any other nation in resource of iron and timber with inexhaustible quantity of fuel in the immediate vicinity of both and all available and in close proximity to navigable water without the advantage of public work the resource of the nation have be develop and power display in the construction of a navy of such magnitude which have at the very period of creation render signal service to the union the increase of the number of seaman in the public service from man in to about|34,000 at the present time have be accomplish without special legislation or extraordinary bounty to promote that increase have be find however that the operation of the draft with the high bounty pay for army recruit be begin to affect injuriously the naval service and will if not correct be likely to impair efficiency by detach seaman from proper vocation and induce to enter the army therefore respectfully suggest that congress may aid both the army and naval service by a definite provision on this subject which would at the same time be equitable to the community more especially interested commend to consideration the suggestion of the secretary of the navy in regard to the policy of fostering and training seaman and also the education of officer and engineer for the naval service the|naval|academy be render signal service in prepare midshipman for the highly responsible duty which in after life will be require to perform in order that the country should not be deprive of the proper quota of educate officer for which legal provision have be make at the naval school the vacancy cause by the neglect or omission to make nomination from the states in insurrection have be fill by the secretary of the navy the school be now more full and complete than at any former period and in every respect entitle to the favorable consideration of congress during the financial condition of the|post office|department have be of increase prosperity and be gratify in be able to state that the actual postal revenue have nearly equal the entire expenditure the latter amount to and the former to leave a deficiency of but in the|year immediately precede the rebellion the deficiency amount to the postal receipt of that|year be less than those of the decrease since in the annual amount of transportation have be only|about|25 per cent but the annual expenditure on account of the same have be reduce be manifest therefore that the|post office|department may become self sustain in a|few|year even with the restoration of the whole service the international conference of postal delegate from the principal country of europe and america which be call at the suggestion of the|postmaster general meet at paris on the|11th|of|may last and conclude deliberation on the|8th|of|june the principle establish by the conference as best adapt to facilitate postal intercourse

under the homestead law and the residue dispose of under law grant land for military bounty for railroad and other purpose also appear that the sale of the public land be largely on the increase have long be a cherish opinion of some of wise statesman that the people of the|united|state have a high and more enduring interest in the early settlement and substantial cultivation of the public land than in the amount of direct revenue to be derive from the sale of this opinion have have a controlling influence in shape legislation upon the subject of national domain may cite as evidence of this the liberal measure adopt in reference to actual settler the grant to of the overflow land within limit in order to be reclaim and render fit for cultivation the grant to railway company of alternate section of land upon the contemplate issue of road which when complete will so largely multiply the facility for reach distant possession this policy have receive most signal and beneficent

and the amount of sale furnish gratify evidence of increase settlement upon the public land notwithstanding the great struggle in which the energy of the nation have be engage and which have require so large a withdrawal of citizen from accustomed pursuit cordially concur in the recommendation of the secretary of the interior suggest a modification of the act in favor of those engage in the military and naval service of the|united|state doubt not that congress will cheerfully adopt such measure as will without essentially change the general feature of the system secure to the great

effect of these treaty will result in the establishment of permanent friendly relation with such of these tribe as have be bring into frequent and bloody collision with outlying settlement and emigrant sound policy and imperative duty to these ward of the government demand anxious and constant attention to material well being to progress in the art of civilization and above all to that

benevolent institution establish or patronize by the government in this district to generous and fostering care the attention of congress during the last session be engage to some extent with a proposition for enlarge the water communication between the|mississippi|river and the northeastern seaboard which proposition however fail for the time since then upon a call of the great respectability a convention have be hold at chicago upon the same subject a summary of whose view be contain in a memorial address to the president and congress and which now have the honor to lay before that this interest be which ere long will force own way do not entertain a doubt while be submit entirely to wisdom as to what can be do now augmented interest be give to this subject by the actual commencement of work upon the|pacific|railroad under auspex so favorable to rapid progress and completion the enlarged navigation become a palpable need to the great road transmit the second annual report of the commissioner of the|department|of|agriculture ask attention to the development in that vital interest of the nation when congress assemble a|year|ago the war have already last nearly|twenty|months and there have be many conflict on both land and sea with vary result the rebellion have be press back into reduced limit yet the tone of public feeling and opinion at home and abroad be not satisfactory with other sign the popular election then just past indicate uneasiness among while amid much that be cold and menacing the kind word come from europe be uttered in accent of pity that be too blind to surrender a hopeless cause commerce be suffer greatly by a few armed vessel build upon and furnish from foreign shore and be threaten with such addition from the|same|quarter as would sweep trade from the sea and raise blockade have fail to elicit from european|government anything hopeful upon this subject the preliminary emancipation proclamation issue in september be run assigned period to the beginning of the|new|year the final proclamation come include the announcement that color man of suitable condition would be receive into the war service the policy of emancipation and of employ black soldier give to the future a new aspect about which hope and fear and doubt contend in uncertain conflict accord to political system as a matter of civil administration the|general|government have no lawful power to effect emancipation in any state and for a long time have be hope that the rebellion could be suppress without resort to as a military measure be all the while deem possible that the necessity for may come and that if should the crisis of the contest would then be present come and as be anticipate be follow by dark and doubtful day eleven|month have now pass be permit to take another review the rebel border be press still farther back and by the complete opening of the mississippi the country dominate by the rebellion be divide into distinct part with no practical communication between tennessee and arkansas have be substantially clear of insurgent control and influential citizen in each owner of slave and advocate of slavery at the beginning of the rebellion now declare openly for emancipation in respective states of those states not include in the emancipation proclamation maryland and missouri neither of which three|years|ago would tolerate any restraint upon the extension of slavery into new territories only dispute now as to the good mode of remove within own limit of those who be slave at the beginning of the rebellion full be now in military service about|one half of which number actually bear arm in the rank thus give the double advantage of take so much labor from the insurgent cause and supply the place which otherwise must be fill with so many white man so far as test be difficult to say be not as good soldier as any no servile insurrection or tendency to violence or cruelty have mark the measure of emancipation and arm the black these measure have be much discuss in foreign country and contemporary with such discussion the tone of public sentiment there be much improve at home the same measure have be fully discuss support criticise and denounce and the annual election follow be highly encouraging to those whose official duty be to bear the country through this great trial thus have the new reckoning the crisis which threaten to divide the friend of the union be past look now to the present and future and with reference to a resumption of the national authority within the states wherein that authority have be suspend have think fit to issue a proclamation a copy of which be herewith transmit on examination of this proclamation will appear as be believe that nothing will be attempt beyond what be amply justify by the constitution true the form of an oath be give but no man be coerce to take the man be only promise a pardon in case voluntarily take the oath the constitution authorize the executive to grant or withhold the pardon at own absolute discretion and this include the power to grant on term as be fully establish by judicial and other authority be also proffer that if in any of the states name a state government shall be in the mode prescribe set up such government shall be recognize and guarantee by the|united|state and that under the state shall on the constitutional condition be protect against invasion and domestic violence the constitutional obligation of the|united|state to guarantee to every state in the union a republican form of government and to protect the state in the case state be explicit and full but why tender the benefit of this provision only to a state government set up in this particular way this section of the constitution contemplate a case wherein the element within a state favorable to republican government in the union may be too feeble for an opposite and hostile element external to or even within the state and such be precisely the case with which be now deal an attempt to guarantee and protect a revive state government construct in whole or in preponderate part from the very element against whose hostility and violence be to be protect be simply absurd there must be a test by which to separate the oppose element so as to build only from the sound and that test be a sufficiently liberal one which accept as sound whoever will make a swear recantation of former unsoundness but if be proper to require as a test of admission to the political body an oath of allegiance to the|united|state and to the union under why also to the law and proclamation in regard to slavery those law and proclamation be enact and put forth for the purpose of aid in the suppression of the rebellion to give full effect there have to be a pledge for maintenance in judgment have aid and will further aid the cause for which be intend to now abandon would be not only to relinquish a lever of power but would also be a cruel and an astounding breach of faith may add at this point that while remain in present position shall not attempt to retract or modify the emancipation proclamation nor shall return to slavery any person who be free by the term of that proclamation or by any of the act of congress for these and other reason be think best that support of these measure shall be include in the oath and be believe the executive may lawfully claim in return for pardon and restoration of forfeit right which have clear constitutional power to withhold altogether or grant upon the term which shall deem wise for the public interest should be observe also that this part of the oath be subject to the modifying and abrogate power of legislation and supreme judicial decision the propose acquiescence of the|national|executive in any reasonable temporary state arrangement for the freed people be make with the view of possibly modify the confusion and destitution which must at good attend all class by a total revolution of labor throughout whole states be hope that the already deeply afflict people in those states may be somewhat more ready to give up the cause of affliction if to this extent this vital matter be leave to while no power of the|national|executive to prevent an abuse be abridge by the proposition the suggestion in the proclamation as to maintain the political framework of the states on what be call reconstruction be make in the hope that may do good without danger of harm will save labor and avoid great confusion but why any proclamation now upon this subject this question be beset with the conflicting view that the step may be delay too long or be take too soon in some state the element for resumption seem ready for action but remain inactive apparently for want of a rally point a plan of action why shall a adopt the plan of b rather than b that of a and if a and b should agree how can know but that the|general|government here will reject plan by the proclamation a plan be present which may be accept by as a rallying point and which be assure in advance will not be reject here this may bring to act sooner than otherwise would the objection to a premature presentation of a plan by the national|executive consist in the danger of committal on point which could be more safely leave to further development care have be take to so shape the document as to avoid embarrassment from this source say that on certain term certain class will be pardon with right restore be not say that other class or other term will never be in include say specify way be say that reconstruction will be accept if present in a not say will never be accept in any other way the movement by state action for emancipation in several of the states not include in the emancipation proclamation be matter of profound gratulation and while do not repeat in detail what have heretofore so earnestly urge upon this subject general view and feeling remain unchanged and trust that congress will omit no fair opportunity of aid these important step to a great consummation in the midst of other care however important must not lose sight of the fact that the war power be still main reliance to that power alone can look yet for a time to give confidence to the people in the contest region that the insurgent power will not again overrun until that confidence shall be establish little can be do anywhere for what be call reconstruction hence chiefest care must still be direct to the army and navy who have thus far bear hard part so nobly and well and may be esteem fortunate

have not please the almighty to bless with a return of peace can but press on guide by the good light give trust that in own good time and wise way all will yet be well the correspondence touch foreign affair which have take place during the|last|year be herewith submit in virtual compliance with a request to that effect make by the|house|of|representatives near the close of the last session of congress if the condition of relation with other nation be less gratify than have usually be at former period be certainly more satisfactory than a nation so unhappily distract as be may reasonably have apprehend in the|month|of|june|last there be some ground to expect that the maritime power which at the beginning of domestic difficulty so unwisely and unnecessarily as think recognize the insurgent as a belligerent would soon recede from that position which have prove only less injurious to than to own country but the temporary revers which afterwards befall the national arm and which be exaggerate by own disloyal citizen abroad have hitherto delay that act of simple justice the civil war which have so radically change for the moment the occupation and habit of the american people have necessarily disturb the social condition and affect very deeply the prosperity of the nation with which have carry on a commerce that have be steadily increase throughout a period of have at the same time excite political ambition and apprehension which have produce a profound agitation throughout the civilized world in this unusual agitation have forborne from take part in any controversy between foreign state and between party or faction in such state have attempt no propagandism and acknowledge no revolution but have leave to every nation the exclusive conduct and management of own affair struggle have be of course contemplate by foreign nation with reference less to own merit than to suppose and often exaggerated effect and consequence result to those nation nevertheless complaint on the part of this government even if be just would certainly be unwise the treaty with great|britain for the suppression of the slave trade have be put into operation with a good prospect of complete success be an occasion of special pleasure to acknowledge that the execution of on the part of her|majesty's|government have be mark with a jealous respect for the authority of the|united|state and the right of moral and loyal citizen the convention with hanover for the abolition of the stade due have be carry into full effect under the act of congress for that purpose a blockade of of seacoast could not be establish and vigorously enforce in a season of great commercial activity like the present without commit occasional mistake and inflict unintentional injury upon foreign nation and subject a civil war occur in a country where foreigner reside and carry on trade under treaty stipulation be necessarily fruitful of complaint of the violation of neutral right all such collision tend to excite misapprehension and possibly to produce mutual reclamation between nation which have a common interest in preserve peace and friendship in clear case of these kind have so far as possible hear and redress complaint which have be present by friendly power there be still however a large and an augmenting number of doubtful case upon which the government be unable to agree with the government whose protection be demand by the claimant there be moreover many case in which the|united|state or citizen suffer wrong from the naval or military authority of foreign nation which the government of those state be not at once prepare to redress have propose to some of the foreign state thus interested mutual convention to examine and adjust such complaint this proposition have be make especially to great|britain to france to spain and to prussia in each case have be kindly receive but have not yet be formally adopt deem duty to recommend an appropriation in behalf of the owner of the norwegian bark admiral p.|tordenskiold which vessel be in may,|1861 prevent by the commander of the blockading force off charleston from leave that port with cargo notwithstanding a similar privilege have shortly before be grant to an english vessel have direct the secretary of state to cause the paper in the case to be communicate to the proper committee application have be make to by many free americans of african descent to favor emigration with a view to such colonization as be contemplate in recent act of congress other party at home and abroad some from interested motif other upon patriotic consideration and still other influence by philanthropic sentiment have suggest similar measure while on the other hand several of the spanish|american republics have protest against the sending of such colony to respective territory under these circumstance have decline to move any such colony to any state without first obtain the consent of government with an agreement on part to receive and protect such emigrant in all the right of freeman and have at the same time offer to the several states situate within the tropics or have colony there to negotiate with subject to the advice and consent of the senate to favor the voluntary emigration of person of that class to respective territory upon condition which shall be equal just and humane liberia and hayti be as yet the only country to which colonist of african descent from here could go with certainty of be receive and adopt as citizen and regret to say such person contemplate colonization do not seem so willing to migrate to those country as to some other nor so willing as think interest demand believe however opinion among in this respect be improve and that ere long there will be an augmented and considerable migration to both these country from the|united|state the new commercial treaty between the|united|state and the|sultan|of|turkey have be carry into execution a commercial and consular treaty have be negotiate subject to the senate 's consent with liberia and a similar negotiation be now pende with the|republic|of|hayti a considerable improvement of the national commerce be expect to result from these measure relation with great|britain france spain portugal russia prussia denmark sweden austria the|netherlands italy rome and the other european states remain undisturbed very favorable relation also continue to be maintain with turkey morocco china and japan during the|last|year there have not only be no change of previous relation with the independent states of own continent but more friendly sentiment than have heretofore exist be believe to be entertain by these neighbor whose safety and progress be so intimately connect with own this statement especially apply to mexico nicaragua costa|rica honduras peru and chile the commission under the convention with the|republic|of|new|granada close session without have audit and pass upon all the claim which be submit to a proposition be pende to revive the convention that may be able to do more complete justice the joint commission between the|united|state and the|republic|of|costa|rica have complete labor and submit report have favor the project for connect the|united|state with europe by an atlantic telegraph and a similar project to extend the telegraph from san|francisco to connect by a pacific telegraph with the line which be be extend across the|russian|empire the|territories|of|the|united|state with unimportant exception have remain undisturbed by the civil war and be exhibit such evidence of prosperity as justify an expectation that some of will soon be in a condition to be organize as states and be constitutionally admit into the|federal|union the immense mineral resource of some of those territories ought to be develop as rapidly as possible every step in that direction would have a tendency to improve the revenue of the government and diminish the burden of the people be worthy of serious consideration whether some extraordinary measure to promote that end can not be adopt the mean which suggest as most likely to be effective be a scientific exploration of the mineral region in those territories with a view to the publication of result at home and in foreign country result which can not fail to be auspicious the condition of the finance will claim most diligent consideration the vast expenditure incident to the military and naval operation require for the suppression of the rebellion have hitherto be meet with a promptitude and certainty unusual in similar circumstance and the public credit have be fully maintain the continuance of the war however and the increase disbursement make necessary by the augmented force now in the field demand good reflection as to the good mode of provide the necessary revenue without injury to business and with the least possible burden upon labor the suspension of specie payment by the bank soon after the commencement of last session make large issue of united|states note unavoidable in no other way could the payment of the troop and the satisfaction of other just demand be so economically or so well provide for the judicious legislation of congress secure the receivability of these note for loan and internal duty and make a legal tender for other debt have make an universal currency and have satisfied partially at least and for the time the long feel want of an uniform circulating medium save thereby to the people immense sum in discount and exchange a return to specie payment however at the early period compatible with due regard to all interest concern should ever be keep in view fluctuation in the value of currency be always injurious and to reduce these fluctuation to the low possible point will always be a leading purpose in wise legislation convertibility prompt and certain convertibility into coin be generally acknowledge to be the good and sure safeguard against and be extremely doubtful whether a circulation of united|states note payable in coin and sufficiently large for the want of the people can be permanently usefully and safely maintain be there then any other mode in which the necessary provision for the public want can be make and the great advantage of a safe and uniform currency secure know of none which promise so certain result and be at the same time so unobjectionable as the organization of banking association under a general act of congress well guard in provision to such association the government may furnish circulating note on the security of united|states bond deposit in the treasury these note prepare under the supervision of proper officer be uniform in appearance and security and convertible always into coin would at once protect labor against the evil of a vicious currency and facilitate commerce by cheap and safe exchange a moderate reservation from the interest on the bond would compensate the|united|state for the preparation and distribution of the note and a general supervision of the system and would lighten the burden of that part of the public debt employ as security the public credit moreover would be greatly improve and the negotiation of new loan greatly facilitate by the steady market demand for government bond which the adoption of the propose system would create be an additional recommendation of the measure of considerable weight in judgment that would reconcile as far as possible all exist interest by the opportunity offer to exist institution to reorganize under the act substitute only the secured uniform national circulation for the local and various circulation secure and unsecured now issue by the receipt into the treasury from all source include loan and balance from the|preceding|year for the|fiscal|year|ending|on|the|30th|june,|1862 be of which sum be derive from custom from the direct tax from public land from miscellaneous

observe that the sum of expend for reimbursement and redemption of public debt be include also in the loan make may be properly deduct both from receipt and expenditure leave the actual receipt for the|year and the expenditure other information on the subject of the finance will be find in the report of the secretary of the treasury to whose statement and view invite most candid and considerate attention the report of the|secretaries|of|war and of the navy be herewith transmit these report though lengthy be scarcely more than brief abstract of the very numerous and extensive transaction and operation conduct through those departments nor could give a summary of here upon any principle which would admit of be much short than the report therefore content with lay the report before and ask attention to give pleasure to report a decided improvement in the financial condition of the|post office|department as compare with several|preceding|years the receipt for the|fiscal|year|1861 amount to which embrace the revenue from all the states of the union for three|quarters|of|that|year notwithstanding the cessation of revenue from the so call secede state during the|last|fiscal|year the increase of the correspondence of the loyal states have be sufficient to produce a revenue during the|same|year of be less than be derive from all the states of the union during the|previous|year the expenditure show a still more favorable result the amount expend in be for the|last|year the amount have be reduce to show a decrease of about|$2,481,000 in the expenditure as compare with the|preceding|year and about|$3,750,000 as compare with the|fiscal|year|1860 the deficiency in the department for the|previous|year be for the|last|fiscal|year be reduce to these favorable result be in part owe to the cessation of mail service in the insurrectionary states and in part to a careful review of all expenditure in that department in the interest of economy the efficiency of the postal service be believe have also be much improve the|postmaster general have also open a correspondence through the|department|of|state with foreign government propose a convention of postal representative for the purpose of simplify the rate of foreign postage and to expedite the foreign mail this proposition equally important to adopt citizen and to the commercial interest of this country have be favorably entertain and agree to by all the government from whom reply have be receive ask the attention of congress to the suggestion of the|postmaster general in report respect the further legislation require in opinion for the benefit of the postal service the secretary of the interior report as follow in regard to the public land the public land have cease to be a source of revenue from the|1st|july,|1861 to the|30th|september,|1862 the entire cash receipt from the sale of land be sum much less than the expense of land system during the same period the homestead law which will take effect on the|1st|of|january next offer such inducement to settler that sale for cash can not be expect to an extent sufficient to meet the expense of the|general|land|office and the cost of surveying and bring the land into market the discrepancy between the sum here state as arise from the sale of the public land and the sum derive from the same source as report from the|treasury|department arise as understand from the fact that the period of time though apparently be not really coincident at the beginning point the treasury report include a considerable sum now which have previously be report from the interior sufficiently large to greatly overreach the sum derive from the|three|months now report upon by the interior and not by the treasury the indian tribe upon frontier have during the|past|year manifest a spirit of insubordination and at several point have engage in open hostility against the white settlement in vicinity the tribe occupy the indian country south of kansas renounce allegiance to the|united|state and enter into treaty with the insurgent those who remain loyal to the|united|state be drive from the country the chief of the cherokees have visit this city for the purpose of restore the former relation of the tribe with the|united|state allege that be constrain by superior force to enter into treaty with the insurgent and that the|united|states neglect to furnish the protection which treaty stipulation require in the|month|of|august last the sioux indians in minnesota attack the settlement in vicinity with extreme ferocity kill indiscriminately man woman and child this attack be wholly unexpected and therefore no mean of defense have be prod be estimate that not person be kill by the indians and a large amount of property be destroy how this outbreak be induce be not definitely know and suspicion which may be unjust need not to be state information be receive by the|indian|bureau from different source about the time hostility be commence that a simultaneous attack be to be make upon the white settlement by all the tribe between the|mississippi|river and the|rocky|mountain the|state|of|minnesota have suffer great injury from this indian war a large portion of territory have be depopulate and a severe loss have be sustain by the destruction of property the people of that state manifest much anxiety for the removal of the tribe beyond the limit of the state as a guaranty against future hostility the commissioner of indian|affairs will furnish full detail submit for especial consideration whether indian system shall not be remodel many wise and good man have impress with the belief that this can be profitably do submit a statement of the proceeding of commissioner which show the progress that have be make in the enterprise of construct the|pacific|railroad and this suggest the early completion of this road and also the favorable action of congress upon the project now pende before for enlarge the capacity of the great canal in new|york and illinois as be of vital and rapidly increase importance to the whole nation and especially to the vast interior region hereinafter to be notice at some great length purpose have prepare and lay before at an|early|day some interesting and valuable statistical information upon this subject the military and commercial importance of enlarge the illinois and michigan|canal and improve be present in the report of colonel webster to the secretary of war and now transmit to congress respectfully ask attention to to carry out the provision of the act of congress of the 15th of may last have cause the|department|of|agriculture|of the|united|state to be organize the commissioner inform that within the period of a|few|month this department have establish an extensive system of correspondence and exchange both at home and abroad which promise to effect highly beneficial result in the development of a correct knowledge of recent improvement in agriculture in the introduction of new product and in the collection of the agricultural statistic of the different states also that will soon be prepared to distribute largely seed cereal plant and cutting and have already publish and liberally diffuse much valuable information in anticipation of a more elaborate report which will in due time be furnish embrace some valuable test in chemical science now in progress in the laboratory the creation of this department be for the more immediate benefit of a large class of most valuable citizen and trust that the liberal basis upon which have be organize will not only meet approbation but that will realize at no distant day all the fond anticipation of most sanguine friend and become the fruitful source of advantage to all people on the|22d|day|of|september last a proclamation be issue by the executive a copy of which be herewith submit in accordance with the purpose express in the second paragraph of that paper now respectfully recall attention to what may be call compensated emancipation a nation may be say to consist of territory people and law the territory be the only part which be of certain durability generation passeth away and another generation cometh but the earth abideth forever be of the first importance to duly consider and estimate this ever endure part that portion of the earth 's surface which be own and inhabit by the people of the|united|state be well adapt to be the home of national family and be not well adapt for or more vast extent and variety of climate and production be of advantage in this age for people whatever may have be in former age steam telegraphs and intelligence have bring these to be an advantageous combination for united people in the inaugural address briefly point out the total inadequacy of disunion as a remedy for the difference between the people of the section do so in language which can not improve and which therefore beg to repeat section of country believe slavery be right and ought to be extend while the other believe be wrong and ought not to be extend this be the only substantial dispute the fugitive slave clause of the constitution and the law for the suppression of the foreign slave trade be each as well enforce perhaps as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly support the law the great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both case and a few break over in each this think can not be perfectly cure and would be bad in both case after the separation of the section than before the foreign slave trade now imperfectly suppress would be ultimately revive without restriction in section while fugitive slave now only partially surrender would not be surrender at all by the other physically speak can not separate can not remove respective section from each other nor build an impassable wall between a husband and wife may be divorce and go out of the presence and beyond the reach of each other but the different part of country can not do this can not but remain face to face and intercourse either amicable or hostile must continue between be possible then to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before can alien make treaty easy than friend can make law can treaty be more faithfully enforce between alien than law can among friend suppose go to war can not fight always and when after much loss on both side and no gain on either cease fight the identical old question as to term of intercourse be again upon there be no line straight or crooked suitable for a national boundary upon which to divide trace through from east to west upon the line between the free and slave country and shall find a little more than third of length be river easy to be cross and populate or soon to be populate thickly upon both side while nearly all remain length be merely surveyor ' line over which people may walk back and forth without any consciousness of presence no part of this line can be make any more difficult to pass by write down on paper or parchment as a national boundary the fact of separation if come give up on the part of the seceding section the fugitive slave clause along with all other constitutional obligation upon the section secede from while should expect no treaty stipulation would ever be make to take place but there be another difficulty the great interior region bound east by the alleghanies north by the british dominion west by the|rocky|mountain and south by the line along which the culture of corn and cotton meet and which include part of virginia part of tennessee all of kentucky ohio indiana michigan wisconsin illinois missouri kansas iowa minnesota and nebraska and part of colorado already have above people and will have within fifty|year if not prevent by any political folly or mistake contain third of the country own by the|united|state certainly more|than|1,000,000|square|miles once half as populous as massachusetts already be would have people a glance at the map show that territorially speak be the great body of the republic the other part be but marginal border to the magnificent region slope west from the|rocky|mountain to the pacific be the deep and also the rich in undeveloped resource in the production of provision grain grass and all which proceed from this great interior region be naturally of the most important in the world ascertain from the statistic the small proportion of the region which have as yet be bring into cultivation and also the large and rapidly increase amount of product and shall be overwhelm with the magnitude of the prospect present and yet this region have no seacoast touch no ocean anywhere as part of nation people now find and may forever find way to europe by new|york to south|america and africa by new|orleans and to asia by san|francisco but separate common country into nation as design by the present rebellion and every man of this great interior region be thereby cut off from some|one or more of these outlet not perhaps by a physical barrier but by embarrassing and onerous trade regulation and this be true wherever a dividing or boundary line may be fix place between the now free and slave country or place south of kentucky or north of ohio and still the truth remain that none south of can trade to any port or place north of and none north of can trade to any port or place south of except upon term dictate by a government foreign to these outlet east west and south be indispensable to the well being of the people inhabit and to inhabit this vast interior region which of the may be the good be no proper question all be well than either and all of right belong to that people and to successor forever true to will not ask where a line of separation shall be but will vow rather that there shall be no such line nor be the marginal region less interested in these communication to and through to the great outside world too and each of must have access to this egypt of the west without pay toll at the crossing of any national boundary national strife spring not from permanent part not from the land inhabit not from national homestead there be no possible severing of this but would multiply and not mitigate evil among in all adaptation and aptitude demand union and abhor separation in fact would ere long force reunion however much of blood and treasure the separation may have cost strife pertain to to the pass generation of man and can without convulsion be hush forever with the passing of generation in this view recommend the adoption of the follow resolution and article amendatory to the|united|state resolve by the senate and house|of|representatif of in congress assemble third of both house concurring that the follow article be propose to the legislature or convention of the several states as amendment to the constitution of the|united|state all or any of which article when ratify by fourth of the say legislature or convention to be valid as part or part of the say constitution viz art.—. every state wherein slavery now exist which shall abolish the same therein at any time or time before the|1st|day|of|january a.d.|1900 shall receive compensation from the|united|state as follow to wit the president of the|united|state shall deliver to every such state bond of the|united|state bear interest at the rate of per cent per to an amount equal to the aggregate sum of____for each slave show to have be therein by the|eighth|census of the|united|state say bond to be deliver to such state by installment or in parcel at the completion of the abolishment accordingly as the same shall have be gradual or at time within such state and interest shall begin to run upon any such bond only from the proper time of delivery as aforesaid any state have receive bond as aforesaid and afterwards reintroduce or tolerate slavery therein shall refund to the|united|states the bond so receive or the value thereof and all interest pay thereon art all slave who shall have enjoy actual freedom by the chance of the war at any time before the end of the rebellion shall be forever free but all owner of such who shall not have be disloyal shall be compensate for at the same rate as be provide for states adopt abolishment of slavery but in such way that no slave shall be twice account for art.—congress may appropriate money and otherwise provide for colonize free colored person with own consent at any place or place without the|united|state beg indulgence to discuss these propose article at some length without slavery the rebellion could never have exist without slavery could not continue among the friend of the union there be great diversity of sentiment and of policy in regard to slavery and the african race amongst some would perpetuate slavery some would abolish suddenly and without compensation some would abolish gradually and with compensation some would remove the freed people from and some would retain with and there be yet other minor diversity because of these diversity waste much strength in struggle among by mutual concession should harmonize and act together this would be compromise but would be compromise among the friend and not with the enemy of the union these article be intend to embody a plan of such mutual concession if the plan shall be adopt be assume that emancipation will follow at least in several of the|state as to the first article the main point be first the emancipation secondly the length of time for consummate seven|year and thirdly the compensation the emancipation will be unsatisfactory to the advocate of perpetual slavery but the length of time should greatly mitigate dissatisfaction the time spare both race from the evil of sudden derangement in fact from the necessity of any derangement while most of those whose habitual course of thought will be disturb by the measure will have pass away before consummation will never see another class will hail the prospect of emancipation but will deprecate the length of time will feel that give too little to the now live slave but really give much save from the vagrant destitution which must largely attend immediate emancipation in locality where number be very great and give the inspiring assurance that posterity shall be free forever the plan leave to each state choose to act under to abolish slavery now or at the|end|of|the|century or at any intermediate time or by degree extend over the whole or any part of the period and oblige no states to proceed alike also provide for compensation and generally the mode of make this would seem must further mitigate the dissatisfaction of those who favor perpetual slavery and especially of those who be to receive the compensation doubtless some of those who be to pay and not to receive will object yet the measure be both just and economical in a certain sense the liberation of slave be the destruction of property property acquire by descent or by purchase the same as any other property be no less true for have be often say that the people of the south be not more responsible for the original introduction of this property than be the people of the north and when be remember how unhesitatingly all use cotton and sugar and share the profit of deal in may not be quite safe to say that the south have be more responsible than the north for continuance if then for a common object this property be to be sacrifice be not just that be do at a common charge and if with less money or money more easily pay can preserve the benefit of the union by this mean than can by the war alone be not also economical to do let consider then let ascertain the sum have expend in the war since compensated emancipation be propose last|march and consider whether if that measure have be promptly accept by even some of the slave state the same sum would not have do more to close the war than have be otherwise do if so the measure would save money and in that view would be a prudent and economical measure certainly be not so easy to pay something as be to pay nothing but be easy to pay a large sum than be to pay a large and be easy to pay any sum when be able than be to pay before be able the war require large sum and require at once the aggregate sum necessary for compensated emancipation of course would be large but would require no ready cash nor the bond even any faster than the emancipation progress this may not and probably would not close before the end of the year at that time shall probably have a|hundred|million of people to share the burden instead of one|million as now and not only so but the increase of population may be expect to continue for a long time after that period as rapidly as before because territory will not have become full do not state this inconsiderately at the same ratio of increase which have maintain on an average from first national census in until that of should in have a population of and why may not continue that ratio far beyond that period abundant room broad national homestead be ample resource be territory as limited as be the|british|isle very certainly population could not expand as state instead of receive the foreign bear as now should be compel to send part of the native bear away but such be not condition have europe have with a population average person to the square mile why may not country at some time average as many be less fertile have more waste surface by mountain river lake desert or other cause be inferior to europe in any natural advantage if then be at some time to be as populous as europe how soon as to when this may be can judge by the past and the present as to when will be if ever depend much on whether maintain the union several of state be already above the average of europe to the square mile massachusetts have rhode|island connecticut new|york and new|jersey each also other great states pennsylvania and ohio be not far below the former have and the latter the states already above the european average except new|york have increase in as rapid a ratio since pass that point as ever before while no one of be equal to some other part of country in natural capacity for sustain a dense population take the nation in the aggregate and find population and ratio of increase for the several decennial period to be as follow year population ratio of increase percent this show an average decennial increase of in population through the|seventy|years from first to last census vet take be see that the ratio of increase at no one of these period be either below or above the average thus show how inflexible and consequently how reliable the law of increase in case be assume that will continue give the follow result year population 1900|103,208,415 1910|138,918,526 1920|186,984,335 these figure show that country may be as populous as europe now be at some point between and about territory at person to the square mile be of capacity to contain and will reach this too if do not relinquish the chance by the folly and evil of disunion or by long and exhausting war spring from the only great element of national discord among while can not be foresee exactly how much huge example of secession breed less one indefinitely would retard population civilization and prosperity no one can doubt that the extent of would be very great and injurious the propose emancipation would shorten the war perpetuate peace insure this increase of population and proportionately the wealth of the country with these should pay all the emancipation would cost together with other debt easy than should pay other debt without if have allow old national debt to run at per annum simple interest from the end of revolutionary struggle until to day without pay anything on either principal or interest each man of would owe less upon that debt now than each man owe upon then and this because increase of man through the whole period have be great than per cent have run faster than the interest upon the debt thus time alone relieve a debtor nation so long as population increase faster than unpaid interest accumulate on debt this fact would be no excuse for delay payment of what be justly due but show the great importance of time in this connection the great advantage of a policy by which shall not have to pay until number what by a different policy would have to pay now when number but in a word show that a dollar will be much hard to pay for the war than will be a dollar for emancipation on the propose plan and then the latter will cost no blood no precious life will be a saving of both as to the second article think would be impracticable to return to bondage the class of person therein contemplate some of doubtless in the property sense belong to loyal owner and hence provision be make in this article for compensate such the third article relate to the future of the freed people do not oblige but merely authorize congress to aid in colonize such as may consent this ought not to be regard as objectionable on the hand or on the other insomuch as come to nothing unless by the mutual consent of the people to be deport and the american voter through representative in congress can not make better known than already be that strongly favor colonization and yet wish to say there be an objection urge against free colored person remain in the country which be largely imaginary if not sometimes malicious be insist that presence would injure and displace white labor and white laborer if there ever could be a proper time for mere catch argument that time surely be not now in time like the present man should utter nothing for which would not willingly be responsible through time and in eternity be true then that colored people can displace any more white labor by be free than by remain slave if stay in old place jostle no white laborer if leave old place leave open to white laborer logically there be neither more nor less of emancipation even without deportation would probably enhance the wage of white labor and very surely would not reduce thus the customary amount of labor would still have to be perform the freed people would surely not do more than old proportion of and very probably for a time would do less leave an increase part to white laborer bring labor into great demand and consequently enhance the wage of with deportation even to a limited extent enhance wage to white labor be mathematically certain labor be like any other commodity in the market increase the demand for and increase the price of reduce the supply of black labor by colonize the black laborer out of the country and by precisely so much increase the demand for and wage of white labor but be dread that the freed people will swarm forth and cover the whole land be not already in the land will liberation make any more numerous equally distribute among the white of the whole country and there would be but color to white could the one in any way greatly disturb the there be many community now have free colored person to white and this without any apparent consciousness of evil from the|district|of|columbia and of maryland and delaware be all in this condition the district have free colored to white and yet in frequent petition to congress believe have never present the presence of free colored person as of grievance but why should emancipation south send the free people north people of any color seldom run unless there be something to run from hertofore color people to some extent have flee north from bondage and now perhaps from both bondage and destitution but if gradual emancipation and deportation be adopt will have neither to flee from old master will give wage at least until new laborer can be procure and the freedman in turn will gladly give labor for the wage till new home can be find for in congenial clime and with people of own blood and race this proposition can be trust on the mutual interest involve and in any event can not the north decide for whether to receive again as practice prove more than theory in any case have there be any irruption of colored people northward because of the abolishment of slavery in this district last|spring what have say of the proportion of free colored person to the white in the district be from the census of have no reference to person call contraband nor to those make free by the act of congress abolish slavery here the plan consist of these article be recommend not but that a restoration of the national authority would be accept without adoption nor will the war nor proceeding under the proclamation of september|22,|1862 be stay because of the recommendation of this plan timely adoption doubt not would bring restoration and thereby stay both and notwithstanding this plan the recommendation that congress provide by law for compensate any state which may adopt emancipation before this plan shall have be act upon be hereby earnestly renew such would be only an advance part of the plan and the same argument apply to both this plan be recommend as a means not in exclusion of but additional to all other for restore and preserve the national authority throughout the union the subject be present exclusively in economical aspect the plan would be confident secure peace more speedily and maintain more permanently than can be do by force alone while all would cost consider amount and manner of payment and time of payment would be easier pay than will be the additional cost of the war if rely solely upon force be much very much that would cost no blood at all the plan be propose as permanent constitutional law can not become such without the concurrence of first third of congress and afterwards fourth of the states the requisite fourth of the states will necessarily include of the slave states concurrence if obtain will give assurance of severally adopt emancipation at no very distant day upon the new constitutional term this assurance would end the struggle now and save the union forever do not forget the gravity which should characterize a paper address to the congress of the nation by the chief magistrate of the nation nor do forget that some of be senior nor that many of have more experience than in the conduct of public affair yet trust that in view of the great responsibility rest upon will perceive no want of respect to yourself in any undue earnestness may seem to display be doubt then that the plan propose if adopt would shorten the war and thus lessen expenditure of money and of blood be doubt that would restore the national authority and national prosperity and perpetuate both indefinitely be doubt that here — congress and executive can secure adoption will not the good people respond to a united and earnest appeal from can can by any other mean so certainly or so speedily assure these vital object can succeed only by concert be not can any of imagine well but can all do better object whatsoever be possible still the question recur can do better the dogma of the quiet past be inadequate to the stormy present the occasion be pile high with difficulty and must rise with the occasion as case be new so must think anew and act anew must disenthrall and then shall save country fellow citizen can not escape history of this congress and this administration will be remember in spite of no personal significance or insignificance can spare or another of the fiery trial through which pass will light down in honor or dishonor to the late generation say be for the union the world will not forget that say this know how to save the union the world know do know how to save even here hold the power and bear the responsibility in give freedom to the slave assure freedom to the free — honorable alike in what give and what preserve shall nobly save or meanly lose the last good hope of earth other mean may succeed this could not fail the way be plain peaceful generous just — a way which if follow the world will forever applaud and god must forever bless transcript fellow citizens of the senate and house|of|representatif in the midst of unprecedented political trouble have cause of great gratitude to god for unusual good health and most abundant harvest will not be surprised to learn that in the peculiar exigency of the time intercourse with foreign nation have be attend with profound solicitude chiefly turn upon own domestic affair a disloyal portion of the american people have during the|whole|year be engage in an attempt to divide and destroy the union a nation which endure factious domestic division be expose to disrespect abroad and party if not both be sure sooner or later to invoke foreign intervention nation thus tempt to interfere be not always able to resist the counsel of seem expediency and ungenerous ambition although measure adopt under such influence seldom fail to be unfortunate and injurious to those adopt the disloyal citizen of the|united|state who have offer the ruin of country in return for the aid and comfort which have invoke abroad have receive less patronage and encouragement than probably expect if be just to suppose as the insurgent have seem to assume that foreign nation in this case discard all moral social and treaty obligation would act solely and selfishly for the most speedy restoration of commerce include especially the acquisition of cotton those nation appear as yet not to have see way to object more directly or clearly through the destruction than through the preservation of the union if could dare to believe that foreign nation be actuate by no high principle than this be quite sure a sound argument could be make to show that can reach aim more readily and easily by aid to crush this rebellion than by give encouragement to the principal lever rely on by the insurgent for exciting foreign nation to hostility against as already intimate be the embarrassment of commerce those nation however not improbably see from the first that be the union which make as well foreign as domestic commerce can scarcely have fail to perceive that the effort for disunion produce the exist difficulty and that strong nation promise more durable peace and a more extensive valuable and reliable commerce than can the same nation break into hostile fragment be not purpose to review discussion with foreign state because whatever may be wish or disposition the integrity of country and the stability of government mainly depend not upon but on the loyalty virtue patriotism and intelligence of the american people the correspondence with the usual reservation be herewith submit venture to hope will appear that have practice prudence and liberality toward foreign power avert cause of irritation and with firmness maintain own right and honor since however be apparent that here as in every other state foreign danger necessarily attend domestic difficulty recommend that adequate and ample measure be adopt for maintain the public defense on every side while under this general recommendation provision for defend seacoast line readily occur to the mind also in the same connection ask the attention of congress to great lake and river be believe that some fortification and depot of arm and munition with harbor and navigation improvement all at well select point upon these would be of great importance to the national defense and preservation ask attention to the view of the secretary of war express in report upon the same general subject deem of importance that the loyal region of east tennessee and western north|carolina should be connect with kentucky and other faithful part of the union by railroad therefore recommend as a military measure that congress provide for the construction of such road as speedily as possible kentucky no doubt will cooperate and through legislature make the most judicious selection of a line the northern terminus must connect with some exist railroad and whether the route shall be from lexington or nicholasville to the cumberland gap or from lebanon to the tennessee line in the direction of knoxville or on some still different line can easily be determine kentucky and the|general|government cooperating the work can be complete in a very short time and when do will be not only of vast present usefulness but also a valuable permanent improvement worth cost in all the future some treaty design chiefly for the interest of commerce and have no grave political importance have be negotiate and will be submit to the senate for consideration although have fail to induce some of the commercial power to adopt a desirable melioration of the rigor of maritime war have remove all obstruction from the way of this humane reform except such as be merely of temporary and accidental occurrence invite attention to the correspondence between britannic|majesty 's minister accredit to this government and the secretary of state relative to the detention of the british ship perthshire in june last by steamer massachusetts for a suppose breach of the blockade as this detention be occasion by an obvious misapprehension of the fact and as justice require that should commit no belligerent act not round in strict right as sanction by public law recommend that an appropriation be make to satisfy the reasonable demand of the owner of the vessel for detention repeat the recommendation of predecessor in annual message to congress in december last in regard to the disposition of the surplus which will probably remain after satisfy the claim of american citizen against china pursuant to the award of the commissioner under the act of the|3d|of|march,|1859 if however should not be deem advisable to carry that recommendation into effect would suggest that authority be give for invest the principal over the proceed of the surplus refer to in good security with a view to the satisfaction of such other just claim of citizen against china as be not unlikely to arise hereafter in the course of extensive trade with that empire by the act of the 5th of august last congress authorize the president to instruct the commander of suitable vessel to defend against and to capture pirate this authority have be exercise in a single instance only for the more effectual protection of extensive and valuable commerce in the eastern sea especially seem to that would also be advisable to authorize the commander of sailing vessel to recapture any prize which pirate may make of united|states vessel and cargo and the consular court now establish by law in eastern country to adjudicate the case in the event that this should not be object to by the local authority if any good reason exist why should persevere longer in withhold recognition of the independence and sovereignty of hayti|and|liberia be unable to discern unwilling however to inaugurate a novel policy in regard to without the approbation of congress submit for consideration the expediency of an appropriation for maintain a charge d'affaire near each of those new states do not admit of doubt that important commercial advantage may be secure by favorable treaty with the operation of the treasury during the period which have elapse since adjournment have be conduct with signal success the patriotism of the people have place at the disposal of the government the large mean demand by the public exigency much of the national loan have be take by citizen of the industrial class whose confidence in country 's faith and zeal for country 's deliverance from present peril have induce to contribute to the support of the government the whole of limited acquisition this fact impose peculiar obligation to economy in disbursement and energy in action the revenue from all source include loan for the|financial|year|ending|on|the|30th|of|june,|1861 be and the expenditure for the same period include payment on account of the public debt be leave a balance in the treasury on the|1st|of|july of for the|first|quarter|of|the|financial|year|ending|on|the|30th|of|september,|1861 the receipt from all source include the balance of the|1st|of|july be and the expense leave a balance on the|1st|of|october,|1861 of estimate for the remain three|quarters|of|the|year and for the|financial|year|1863 together with view of way and mean for meet the demand contemplate by will be submit to congress by the secretary of the treasury be gratify to know that the expenditure make necessary by the rebellion be not beyond the resource of the loyal people and to believe that the same patriotism which have thus far sustain the government will continue to sustain till peace and union shall again bless the land respectfully refer to the report of the secretary of war for information respect the numerical strength of the army and for recommendation have in view an increase of efficiency and the well being of the various branch of the service intrust to care be gratify to know that the patriotism of the people have prove equal to the occasion and that the number of troop tender greatly exceed the force which congress authorize to call into the field refer with pleasure to those portion of report which make allusion to the creditable degree of discipline already attain by troop and to the excellent sanitary condition of the entire army the recommendation of the secretary for an organization of the militia upon a uniform basis be a subject of vital importance to the future safety of the country and be commend to the serious attention of congress the large addition to the|regular|army in connection with the defection that have so considerably diminish the number of officer give peculiar importance to recommendation for increase the corps of cadet to the great capacity of the|military|academy by mere omission presume congress have fail to provide chaplain for hospital occupy by volunteer this subject be bring to notice and be induce to draw up the form of a letter copy of which properly address have be deliver to each of the person and at the date respectively name and state in a schedule contain also the form of the letter mark a and herewith transmit these gentleman understand enter upon the duty designate at the time respectively state in the schedule and have labor faithfully therein ever since therefore recommend that be compensate at the same rate as chaplain in the army further suggest that general provision be make for chaplain to serve at hospital as well as with regiment the report of the secretary of the navy present in detail the operation of that branch of the service the activity and energy which have characterize administration and the result of measure to increase efficiency and power such have be the addition by construction and purchase that may almost be say a navy have be create and bring into service since difficulty commence besides blockade extensive coast squadron large than ever before assemble under flag have be put afloat and perform deed which have increase naval renown would invite special attention to the recommendation of the secretary for a more perfect organization of the navy by introduce additional grade in the service the present organization be defective and unsatisfactory and the suggestion submit by the department will be believe if adopt obviate the difficulty allude to promote harmony and increase the efficiency of the navy there be vacancy on the bench of the|supreme|court by the decease of justices|daniel and mclean and by the resignation of justice campbell have so far forborne make nomination to fill these vacancy for reason which will now state of the outgoing judge reside within the states now overrun by revolt so that if successor be appoint in the same locality could not now serve upon circuit and many of the most competent man there probably would not take the personal hazard of accept to serve even here upon the supreme bench have be unwilling to throw all the appointment northward thus disable from do justice to the south on the return of peace although may remark that to transfer to the north which have heretofore be in the south would not with reference to territory and population be unjust during the long and brilliant judicial career of judge mclean circuit grow into an empire altogether too large for any judge to give the court therein more than a nominal attendance rise in population from in to in besides this the country generally have outgrow present judicial system if uniformity be at all intend the system require that all the states shall be accommodate with circuit court attend by supreme judge while in fact wisconsin minnesota iowa kansas florida texas california and oregon have never have any such court nor can this well be remedie without a change in the system because the adding of judge to the|supreme|court enough for the accommodation of all part of the country with circuit court would create a court altogether too numerous for a judicial body of any sort and the evil if be will increase as new states come into the union circuit court be useful or be not useful if useful no state should be deny if not useful no state should have let be provide for all or abolish as to all modification occur to either of which think would be an improvement upon present system let the|supreme|court be of convenient number in every event then first let the whole country be divide into circuit of convenient size the supreme judge to serve in a number of correspond to own number and independent circuit judge be provide for all the rest or secondly let the supreme judge be relieve from circuit duty and circuit judge provide for all the circuit or thirdly dispense with circuit court altogether leave the judicial function wholly to the district court and an independent supreme|court respectfully recommend to the consideration of congress the present condition of the statute law with the hope that congress will be able to find an easy remedy for many of the inconvenience and evil which constantly embarrass those engage in the practical administration of since the organization of the|government|congress have enact some|5,000 act and joint resolution which fill more|than|6,000 closely print page and be scatter through many volume many of these act have be draw in haste and without sufficient caution so that provision be often obscure in or in conflict with each other or at least so doubtful as to render very difficult for even the best inform person to ascertain precisely what the statute law really be seem to very important that the statute law should be make as plain and intelligible as possible and be reduce to as small a compass as may consist with the fullness and precision of the will of the legislature and the perspicuity of language this well do would think greatly facilitate the labor of those whose duty be to assist in the administration of the law and would be a lasting benefit to the people by place before in a more accessible and intelligible form the law which so deeply concern interest and duty be inform by some whose opinion respect that all the act of congress now in force and of a permanent and general nature may be revise and rewrite so as to be embrace in volume or at most volume of ordinary and convenient size and respectfully recommend to congress to consider of the subject and if suggestion be approve to devise such plan as to wisdom shall seem most proper for the attainment of the end propose of the unavoidable consequence of the present insurrection be the entire suppression in many place of all the ordinary mean of administer civil justice by the officer and in the form of exist law this be the case in whole or in part in all the insurgent states and as army advance upon and take possession of part of those states the practical evil become more apparent there be no court nor officer to whom the citizen of other states may apply for the enforcement of lawful claim against citizen of the insurgent states and there be a vast amount of debt constitute such claim some have estimate due in large part from insurgent in open rebellion to loyal citizen who be even now make great sacrifice in the discharge of patriotic duty to support the government under these circumstance have be urgently solicit to establish by military power court to administer summary justice in such case have thus far decline to do not because have any doubt that the end propose the collection of the debt be just and right in but because have be unwilling to go beyond the pressure of necessity in the unusual exercise of power but the power of congress suppose be equal to the anomalous occasion and therefore refer the whole matter to congress with the hope that a plan may be devise for the administration of justice in all such part of the insurgent states and territories as may be under the control of this government whether by a voluntary return to allegiance and order or by the power of arm this however not to be a permanent institution but a temporary substitute and to cease as soon as the ordinay court can be reestablish in peace be important that some more convenient mean should be provide if possible for the adjustment of claim against the government especially in view of increase number by reason of the war be as much the duty of government to render prompt justice against in favor of citizen as be to administer the same between private individual the investigation and adjudication of claim in nature belong to the judicial department besides be apparent that the attention of congress will be more than usually engage for some time to come with great national question be intend by the organization of the|court|of|claims mainly to remove this branch of business from the hall of congress but while the court have prove to be an effective and valuable mean of investigation in great degree fail to effect the object of creation for want of power to make judgment final fully aware of the delicacy not to say the danger of the subject commend to careful consideration whether this power of make judgment final may not properly be give to the court reserve the right of appeal on question of law to the|supreme|court with such other provision as experience may have show to be necessary ask attention to the report of the|postmaster general the follow be a summary statement of the condition of the department the revenue from all source during the|fiscal|year|ending|june|30,|1861 include the annual permanent appropriation of for the transportation of free mail matter be be about|2|per|cent less than the revenue for the expenditure be show a decrease of more than per cent as compare with those of the|previous|year and leave an excess of expenditure over the revenue for the|last|fiscal|year of the gross revenue for the|year|ending|june|30,|1863 be estimate at an increase of on that of make to which should be add the earning of the department in carry free matter viz make the total expenditure for be estimate at leave an estimate deficiency of to be supply from the treasury in addition to the permanent appropriation the present insurrection show think that the extension of this district across the|potomac|river at the time of establish the capital here be eminently wise and consequently that the relinquishment of that portion of which lie within the|state|of|virginia be unwise and dangerous submit for consideration the expediency of regain that part of the district and the restoration of the original boundary thereof through negotiation with the report of the secretary of the interior with the accompany document exhibit the condition of the several branch of the public business pertain to that department the depressing influence of the insurrection have be specially feel in the operation of the patent and general land offices the cash receipt from the sale of public land during the|past|year have exceed the expense of land system the sale have be entirely suspend in the|southern|state while the interruption to the business of the country and the diversion of large number of man from labor to military service have obstruct settlement in the new states and territories of the northwest the receipt of the|patent|office have decline in nine|months about|$100,000 render a large reduction of the force employ necessary to make self sustain the demand upon the|pension|office will be largely increase by the insurrection numerous application for pension base upon the casualty of the exist war have already be make there be reason to believe that many who be now upon the pension roll and in receipt of the bounty of the government be in the rank of the insurgent army or give aid and comfort the secretary of the interior have direct a suspension of the payment of the pension of such person upon proof of disloyalty recommend that congress authorize that officer to cause the name of such person to be stricken from the pension roll the relation of the government with the indian tribe have be greatly disturb by the insurrection especially in the southern superintendency and in that of new|mexico the indian country south of kansas be in the possession of insurgent from texas and arkansas the agent of the|united|state appoint since the|4th|of|march for this superintendency have be unable to reach post while the most of those who be in office before that time have espouse the insurrectionary cause and assume to exercise the power of agent by virtue of commission from the insurrectionist have be state in the public press that a portion of those indians have be organize as a military force and be attach to the army of the insurgent although the government have no official information upon this subject letter have be write to the commissioner of indian|affairs by several prominent chief give assurance of loyalty to the|united|state and express a wish for the presence of federal troop to protect be believe that upon the repossession of the country by the federal force the indians will readily cease all hostile demonstration and resume former relation to the government agriculture confessedly the large interest of the nation have not a department nor a bureau but a clerkship only assign to in the government while be fortunate that this great interest be so independent in nature as to not have demand and extort more from the government respectfully ask congress to consider whether something more can not be give voluntarily with general advantage annual report exhibit the condition of agriculture commerce and manufacture would present a fund of information of great practical value to the country while make no suggestion as to detail venture the opinion that an agricultural and statistical bureau may profitably be organize the execution of the law for the suppression of the african slave trade have be confide to the|department|of|the|interior be a subject of gratulation that the effort which have be make for the suppression of this inhuman traffic have be recently attend with unusual success vessel be fit out for the slave trade have be seize and condemn mate of vessel engage in the trade and person in equip a vessel as a slaver have be convict and subject to the penalty of fine and imprisonment and captain take with a cargo of africans on board vessel have be convict of the high grade of offense under law the punishment of which be death the territories of colorado dakota and nevada create by the last congress have be organize and civil administration have be inaugurate therein under auspex especially gratify when be consider that the leaven of treason be find exist in some of these new country when the federal officer arrive there the abundant natural resource of these territories with the security and protection afford by organized government will doubtless invite to a large immigration when peace shall restore the business of the country to accustomed channel submit the resolution of the legislature of colorado which evidence the patriotic spirit of the people of the territory so far the authority of the|united|state have be uphold in all the territories as be hope will be in the future commend interest and defense to the enlightened and generous care of congress recommend to the favorable consideration of congress the interest of the insurrection have be the cause of much suffering and sacrifice to inhabitant and as have no representative in congress that body should not overlook just claim upon the government at late session a joint resolution be adopt authorize the president to take measure for facilitate a proper representation of the industrial interest of the|united|state at the exhibition of the industry of all nation to be holden at london in the|year|1862 regret to say have be unable to give personal attention to this subject a subject at once so interesting in and so extensively and intimately connect with the material prosperity of the world through the|secretaries|of|state and of the interior a plan or system have be devise and partly matured and which will be lay before under and by virtue of the act of congress entitle an act to confiscate property use for insurrectionary purpose approve august|6,|1861 the legal claim of certain person to the labor and service of certain other person have become forfeited and number of the latter thus liberate be already dependent on the|united|state and must be provide for in some way besides this be not impossible that some of the states will pass similar enactment for own benefit respectively and by operation of which person of the same class will be throw upon for disposal in such case recommend that congress provide for accept such person from such states accord to some mode of valuation in lieu pro tanto of direct taxis or upon some other plan to be agree on with such states respectively that such person on such acceptance by the|general|government be at once deem free and that in any event step be take for colonize both class or the first mention if the other shall not be bring into existence at some place or place in a climate congenial to may be well to consider too whether the free colored people already in the|united|state could not so far as individual may desire be include in such colonization to carry out the plan of colonization may involve the acquiring of territory and also the appropriation of money beyond that to be expend in the territorial acquisition have practice the acquisition of territory for nearly|sixty|years the question of constitutional power to do so be no longer an open one with the power be question at first by mr. jefferson who however in the purchase of louisiana yield scruple on the plea of great expediency if be say that the only legitimate object of acquire territory be to furnish home for white man this measure effect that object for the emigration of colored man leave additional room for white man remain or come here mr. jefferson however place the importance of procure louisiana more on political and commercial ground than on provide room for population on this whole proposition include the appropriation of money with the acquisition of territory do not the expediency amount to absolute necessity that without which the government can not be perpetuate the war continue in consider the policy to be adopt for suppress the insurrection have be anxious and careful that the inevitable conflict for this purpose shall not degenerate into a violent and remorseless revolutionary struggle have therefore in every case think proper to keep the integrity of the union prominent as the primary object of the contest on pan leave all question which be not of vital military importance to the more deliberate action of the legislature in the exercise of good discretion have adhere to the blockade of the port hold by the insurgent instead of put in force by proclamation the law of congress enact the late session for close those port so also obey the dictate of prudence as well as the obligation of law instead of transcend have adhere to the act of congress to confiscate property use for insurrectionary purpose if a new law upon the same subject shall be propose propriety will be duly consider the union must be preserve and hence all indispensable mean must be employ should not be in haste to determine that radical and extreme measure which may reach the loyal as well as the disloyal be indispensable the inaugural address at the beginning of the administration and the message to congress at the late special session be both mainly devote to the domestic controversy out of which the insurrection and consequent war have spring nothing now occur to add or subtract to or from the principle or general purpose state and express in those document the last ray of hope for preserve the union peaceably expire at the assault upon fort|sumter and a general review of what have occur since may not be unprofitable what be painfully uncertain then be much better define and more distinct now and the progress of event be plainly in the right direction the insurgent confidently claim a strong support from north of mason and dixon 's line and the friend of the union be not free from apprehension on the point this however be soon settle definitely and on the right side south of the line noble little delaware lead off right from the first maryland be make to seem against the union soldier be assault bridge be burn and railroad tear up within limit and be many|day at time without the ability to bring a single regiment over soil to the capital now bridge and railroad be repair and open to the government already give regiment to the cause of the union and none to the enemy and people at a regular election have sustain the union by a large majority and a large aggregate vote than ever before give to any candidate or any question kentucky too for some time in doubt be now decidedly and think unchangeably range on the side of the union missouri be comparatively quiet and believe can not again be overrun by the insurrectionist these states of maryland kentucky and missouri neither of which would promise a single soldier at first have now an aggregate of not less|than|40,000 in the field for the union while of citizen certainly not more|than|a|third of that number and of doubtful whereabout and doubtful existence be in arm against after a somewhat bloody struggle of month winter close on the union people of western virginia leave master of own country an insurgent force of about|1,500 for month dominate the narrow peninsular region constitute the county of accomac and northampton and know as of virginia together with some contiguous part of maryland have lay down arm and the people there have renew allegiance to and accept the protection of the old flag this leave no armed insurrectionist north of the potomac or east of the chesapeake also have obtain a footing at each of the isolate point on the southern coast of hatteras port|royal tybee|island near savannah and ship|island and likewise have some general account of popular movement in behalf of the union in north|carolina and tennessee these thing demonstrate that the cause of the union be advance steadily and certainly southward since last adjournment lieutenant general scott have retire from the head of the army during long life the nation have not be unmindful of merit yet on call to mind how faithfully ably and brilliantly have serve the country from a time far back in history when few of the now live have be bear and thenceforward continually can not but think be still debtor submit therefore for consideration what further mark of recognition be due to and to as a grateful people with the retirement of general|scott come the executive duty of appoint in stead a general in chief of the army be a fortunate circumstance that neither in council nor country be there so far as know any difference of opinion as to the proper person to be select the retire chief repeatedly express judgment in favor of general mcclellan for the position and in this the nation seem to give a unanimous concurrence the designation of general mcclellan be therefore in considerable degree the selection of the country as well as of the executive and hence there be well reason to hope there will be give the confidence and cordial support thus by fair implication promise and without which can not with so full efficiency serve the country have be say that bad general be good one and the saying be true if take to mean no more than that an army be better direct by a single mind though inferior than by superior one at variance and cross - purpose with each other and the same be true in all joint operation wherein those engage can have none but a common end in view and can differ only as to the choice of mean in a storm at sea no one on board can wish the ship to sink and yet not unfrequently all go down together because too many will direct and no single mind can be allow to control continue to develop that the insurrection be largely if not exclusively a war upon the first principle of popular government the right of the people conclusive evidence of this be find in the most grave and maturely consider public document as well as in the general tone of the insurgent in those document find the abridgment of the exist right of suffrage and the denial to the people of all right to participate in the selection of public officer except the legislative boldly advocate with labored argument to prove that large control of the people in government be the source of all political evil monarchy be sometimes hint at as a possible refuge from the power of the people in present position could scarcely be justify be to omit raise a warning voice against this approach of return despotism be not need nor fit here that a general argument should be make in favor of popular institution but there be point with connection not so hackneye as most other to which ask a brief attention be the effort to place capital on an equal footing with if not above labor in the structure of government be assume that labor be available only in connection with capital that nobody labor unless somebody else own capital somehow by the use of induce to labor this assume be next consider whether be good that capital shall hire laborer and thus induce to work by own consent or buy and drive to without consent have proceed so far be naturally conclude that all laborer be either hire laborer or what call slave and further be assume that whoever be once a hire laborer be fix in that condition for life now there be no such relation between capital and labor as assume nor be there any such thing as a free man be fix for life in the condition of a hire laborer both these assumption be false and all inference from be groundless labor be prior to and independent of capital capital be only the fruit of labor and could never have exist if labor have not first exist labor be the superior of capital and deserve much the high consideration capital have right which be as worthy of protection as any other right nor be deny that there be and probably always will be a relation between labor and capital produce mutual benefit the error be in assume that the whole labor of community exist within that relation a few man own capital and that few avoid labor and with capital hire or buy another few to labor for a large majority belong to neither class neither work for other nor have other work for in most of the|southern|state a majority of the whole people of all color be neither slave nor master while in the northern a large majority be neither hirer nor hire man with family wife son and daughter work for on farm in house and in shop take the whole product to and ask no favor of capital on the hand nor of hire laborer or slave on the other be not forget that a considerable number of person mingle own labor with capital that is labor with own hand and also buy or hire other to labor for but this be only a mixed and not a distinct class no principle state be disturb by the existence of this mixed class again as have already be say there be not of necessity any such thing as the free hire laborer be fix to that condition for life many independent man everywhere in these states a|few|year back in life be hire laborer the prudent penniless beginner in the world labor for wage awhile save a surplus with which to buy tool or land for then labor on own account another while and at length hire another new beginner to help this be the just and generous and prosperous system which open the way to all give hope to all and consequent energy and progress and improvement of condition to all no man live be more worthy to be trust than those who toil up from poverty none less inclined to take or touch aught which have not honestly earn let beware of surrender a political power which already possess and which if surrender will surely be use to close the door of advancement against such as and to fix new disability and burden upon till all of liberty shall be lose from the first taking of national census to the|last|are|seventy|years and find population at the end of the period time as great as be at the beginning the increase of those other thing which man deem desirable have be even great thus have at view what the popular principle apply to government through the machiney of the states and the union have produce in a give time and also what if firmly maintain promise for the future there be already among those who if the union be preserve will live to see contain the struggle of to day be not altogether for to day be for a vast future also with a reliance on providence all the more firm and earnest let proceed in the great task which event have devolve upon transcript fellow citizens of the senate and house|of|representatif have be convene on an extraordinary occasion as authorize by the constitution attention be not call to any ordinary subject of legislation at the beginning of the present presidential term the function of the|federal|government be find to be generally suspend within the several states of south|carolina georgia alabama mississippi louisiana and florida except only those of the|post office|department within these states all the fort arsenal dockyard custom house and the like include the movable and stationary property in and about have be seize and be hold in open hostility to this government except only forts|pickens taylor and jefferson on and near the florida coast and fort|sumter in charleston|harbor south|carolina the fort thus seize have be put in improve condition new one have be build and armed force have be organize and be organize all avowedly with the same hostile purpose the fort remain in the possession of the|federal|government in and near these state be either besiege or menace by warlike preparation and especially fort|sumter be nearly surround by well protect hostile battery with gun equal in quality to the good of own and outnumber the latter as perhaps to a disproportionate share of the federal musket and rifle have somehow find way into these states and have be seize to be use against the government accumulation of the public revenue lie within have be seize for the same object the navy be scatter in distant sea leave but a very small part of within the immediate reach of the government officer of the|federal|army and navy have resign in great number and of those resign a large proportion have take up arm against the government simultaneously and in connection with all this the purpose to sever the|federal|union be openly avow in accordance with this purpose an ordinance have be adopt in each of these state declare the states respectively to be separate from the|national|union a formula for institute a combine government of these states have be promulgate and this illegal organization in the character of confederate|state be already invoke recognition aid and intervention from foreign power find this condition of thing and believe to be an imperative duty upon the incoming executive to prevent if possible the consummation of such attempt to destroy the|federal|union a choice of mean to that end become indispensable this choice be make and be declare in the inaugural address the policy choose look to the exhaustion of all peaceful measure before a resort to any strong one seek only to hold the public place and property not already wrest from the government and to collect the revenue rely for the rest on time discussion and the ballot box promise a continuance of the mail at government expense to the very people who be resist the government and give repeat pledge against any disturbance to any of the people or any of right of all that which a president may constitutionally and justifiably do in such a case everything be forbear without which be believe possible to keep the government on foot on the 5th of march the present incumbent 's in office a letter of major anderson command at fort|sumter write on the|28th|of|february and receive at on the|4th|of|march be by that department place in hand this letter express the professional opinion of the writer that reenforcement could not be throw into that fort within the time for relief render necessary by the limited supply of provision and with a view of hold possession of the same with a force of less|than|20,000 good and well discipline man this opinion be concur in by all the officer of command and memorandum on the subject be make inclosure of major anderson 's letter the whole be immediately lay before lieutenant general scott who at once concur with major anderson in opinion on reflection however take full time consult with other officer both of the army and the navy and at come reluctantly but decidedly to the same conclusion as before also state at the same time that no such sufficient force be then at the control of the government or could be raise and bring to the ground within the time when the provision in the fort would be exhaust in a purely military point of view this reduce the duty of the administration in the case to the mere matter of get the garrison safely out of the fort be believe however that to so abandon that position under the circumstance would be utterly ruinous that the necessity under which be to be do would not be fully understand that by many would be construe as a part of a voluntary policy that at home would discourage the friend of the union embolden adversary and go far to insure to the latter a recognition abroad that in fact would be national destruction consummate this could not be allow starvation be not yet upon the garrison and ere would be reach fort|picken may be reenforce this last would be a clear indication of policy and would better enable the country to accept the evacuation of fort|sumter as a military necessity an order be at once direct to be send for the landing of the troop from the steamship brooklyn into fort|picken this order could not go by land but must take the longer and slow route by sea the first return news from the order be receive just one|week before the fall of fort|sumter the news be that the officer command the sabine to which vessel the troop have be transfer from the brooklyn act upon some quasi armistice of the late administration and of the existence of which the present administration up to the time the order be dispatch have only too vague and uncertain rumor to fix attention have refuse to land the troop to now reenforce fort|picken before a crisis would be reach at fort|sumter be impossible render so by the near exhaustion of provision in the latter name fort in precaution against such a conjuncture the government have a|few|day before commence prepare an expedition as well adapt as may be to relieve fort|sumter which expedition be intend to be ultimately use or not accord to circumstance the strong anticipated case for use be now present and be resolve to send forward as have be intend in this contingency be also resolve to notify the governor of south|carolina that may expect an attempt would be make to provision the fort and that if the attempt should not be resist there would be no effort to throw in man arm or ammunition without further notice or in case of an attack upon the fort this notice be accordingly give whereupon the fort be attack and bombard to fall without even await the arrival of the provision expedition be thus see that the assault upon and reduction of fort|sumter be in no sense a matter of self defense on the part of the assailant well know that the garrison in the fort could by no possibility commit aggression upon know be expressly notify that the giving of bread to the few brave and hungry man of the garrison be all which would on that occasion be attempt unless by resist so much should provoke more know that this government desire to keep the garrison in the fort not to assail but merely to maintain visible possession and thus to preserve the union from actual and immediate dissolution trust as hereinbefore state to time discussion and the ballot box for final adjustment and assail and reduce the fort for precisely the reverse object to drive out the visible authority of the|federal|union and thus force to immediate dissolution that this be object the executive well understand and have say to in the inaugural address can have no conflict without be the aggressor take pain not only to keep this declaration good but also to keep the case so free from the power of ingenious sophistry as that the world should not be able to misunderstand by the affair at fort|sumter with surround circumstance that point be reach then and thereby the assailant of the government begin the conflict of arm without a gun in sight or in expectancy to return fire save only the few in the fort send to that harbor year before for own protection and still ready to give that protection in whatever be lawful in this act discard all else have force upon the country the distinct issue immediate dissolution or blood and this issue embrace more than the fate of these|united|states present to the whole family of man the question whether a constitutional republic or democracy a government of the people by the same people can or can not maintain territorial integrity against own domestic foe present the question whether discontent individual too few in number to control administration accord to organic law in any case can always upon the pretense make in this case or on any other pretense or arbitrarily without any pretense break up government and thus practically put an end to free government upon the earth force to ask be there in all republic this inherent and fatal weakness must a government of necessity be too strong for the liberty of own people or too weak to maintain own existence so view the issue no choice be leave but to call out the war power of the government and so to resist force employ for destruction by force for preservation the call be make and the response of the country be most gratifying surpass in unanimity and spirit the most sanguine expectation yet none of the states commonly call slave states except delaware give a regiment through regular state organization a few regiment have be organize within some other of those states by individual enterprise and receive into the government service of course the secede states so call and to which texas have be join about the time of the inauguration give no troop to the cause of the union the border states so call be not uniform in action some of be almost for the union while in other as virginia north|carolina tennessee and arkansas the union sentiment be nearly repress and silence the course take in virginia be the most remarkable perhaps the most important a convention elect by the people of that state to consider this very question of disrupt the|federal|union be in session at the capital of virginia when fort|sumter fall to this body the people have choose a large majority of profess union man almost immediately after the fall of sumter many member of that majority go over to the original disunion minority and with adopt an ordinance for withdraw the state from the union whether this change be work by great approval of the assault upon sumter or great resentment at the government 's resistance to that assault be not definitely know although submit the ordinance for ratification to a vote of the people to be take on a|day then somewhat more|than|a|month distant the convention and the legislature which be also in session at the same time and place with lead man of the state not member of either immediately commence act as if the state be already out of the union push military preparation vigorously forward all over the state seize the united|states armory at harpers|ferry and the navy yard at gosport near norfolk receive perhaps invite into state large body of troop with warlike appointment from the so call secede states formally enter into a treaty of temporary alliance and cooperation with the so call confederate|state and send member to congress at montgomery and finally permit the insurrectionary government to be transfer to capital at richmond the people of virginia have thus allow this giant insurrection to make nest within border and this government have no choice leave but to deal with where find and have the less regret as the loyal citizen have in due form claim protection those loyal citizen this government be bind to recognize and protect as be virginia in the border states so call in fact the|middle|stat there be those who favor a policy which call armed neutrality that is an arming of those states to prevent the union force pass way or the disunion the other over soil this would be disunion complete figuratively speak would be the building of an impassable wall along the line of separation and yet not quite an impassable one for under the guise of neutrality would tie the hand of the union man and freely pass supply from among to the insurrectionist which could not do as an open enemy at a stroke would take all the trouble off the hand of secession except only what proceed from the external blockade would do for the disunionist that which of all thing most desire feed well and give disunion without a struggle of own recognize no fidelity to the constitution no obligation to maintain the union and while very many who have favor be doubtless loyal citizen be nevertheless very injurious in effect recur to the action of the government may be state that at first a call be make for militia and rapidly follow this a proclamation be issue for close the port of the insurrectionary district by proceeding in the nature of blockade so far all be believe to be strictly legal at this point the insurrectionist announce purpose to enter upon the practice of privateering other call be make for volunteer to serve three|year unless sooner discharge and also for large addition to the|regular|army and navy these measure whether strictly legal or not be venture upon under what appear to be a popular demand and a public necessity trust then as now that congress would readily ratify be believe that nothing have be do beyond the constitutional competency of congress soon after the first call for militia be consider a duty to authorize the commanding general in proper case accord to discretion to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus or in other word to arrest and detain without resort to the ordinary process and form of law such individual as may deem dangerous to the public safety this authority have purposely be exercise but very sparingly nevertheless the legality and propriety of what have be do under be question and the attention of the country have be call to the proposition that one who be swear to take care that the law be faithfully execute should not violate of course some consideration be give to the question of power and propriety before this matter be act upon the whole of the law which be require to be faithfully execute be be resist and fail of execution in nearly|one third of the states must be allow to finally fail of execution even have be perfectly clear that by the use of the mean necessary to execution some single law make in such extreme tenderness of the citizen 's liberty that practically relieve more of the guilty than of the innocent should to a very limited extent be violate to state the question more directly be all the law but to go unexecuted and the government go to piece lest that be violate even in such a case would not the official oath be break if the government should be overthrow when be believe that disregard the single law would tend to preserve but be not believe that this question be present be not believe that any law be violate the provision of the constitution that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspend unless when in case of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require be equivalent to a provision be a provision that such privilege may be suspend when in case of rebellion or invasion the public safety do require be decide that have a case of rebellion and that the public safety do require the qualified suspension of the privilege of the writ which be authorize to be make now be insist that congress and not the executive be vest with this power but the constitution be silent as to which or who be to exercise the power and as the provision be plainly make for a dangerous emergency can not be believe the framer of the instrument intend that in every case the danger should run course until congress could be call together the very assembling of which may be prevent as be intend in this case by the rebellion no more extended argument be now offer as an opinion at some length will probably be present by the attorney general whether there shall be any legislation upon the subject and if any what be submit entirely to the well judgment of congress the forbearance of this government have be so extraordinary and so long continue as to lead some foreign nation to shape action as if suppose the early destruction of national|union be probable while this on discovery give the executive some concern be now happy to say that the sovereignty and right of the|united|state be now everywhere practically respect by foreign power and a general sympathy with the country be manifest throughout the world the report of the secretaries of the treasury war and the navy will give the information in detail deem necessary and convenient for deliberation and action while the executive and all the departments will stand ready to supply omission or to communicate new fact consider important for to know be now recommend that give the legal mean for make this contest a short and a decisive one that place at the control of the government for the work man and that number of man be about|one tenth of those of proper age within the region where apparently all be willing to engage and the sum be third part of the money value own by the man who seem ready to devote the whole a debt of now be a less sum per head than be the debt of revolution when come out of that struggle and the money value in the country now bear even a great proportion to what be then than do the population surely each man have as strong a motive now to preserve liberty as each have then to establish a right result at this time will be worth more to the time the man and time the money the evidence reach from the country leave no doubt that the material for the work be abundant and that need only the hand of legislation to give legal sanction and the hand of the executive to give practical shape and efficiency of the great perplexity of the government be to avoid receive troop faster than can provide for in a word the people will save government if the government will do part only indifferently well may seem at first thought to be of little difference whether the present movement at the south be call secession or rebellion the mover however well understand the difference at the beginning know could never raise treason to any respectable magnitude by any name which imply violation of law know people possess as much of moral sense as much of devotion to law and order and as much pride in and reverence for the history and government of common country as any other civilized and patriotic people know could make no advancement directly in the tooth of these strong and noble sentiment accordingly commence by an insidious debauching of the public mind invent an ingenious sophism which if concede be follow by perfectly logical step through all the incident to the complete destruction of the union the sophism be that any state of the union may consistently with the|national|constitution and therefore lawfully and peacefully withdraw from the union without the consent of the union or of any other state the little disguise that the suppose right be to be exercise only for just cause to be the sole judge of justice be too thin to merit any notice with rebellion thus sugar coat have be drug the public mind of section for more|than|thirty|year and until at length have bring many good man to a willingness to take up arm against the government the|day after some assemblage of man have enact the farcical pretense of take state out of the union who could have be bring to no such thing the|day|before this sophism derive much perhaps the whole of currency from the assumption that there be some omnipotent and sacred supremacy pertain to a state to each state of federal|union state have neither more nor less power than that reserve to in the|union|by|the|constitution no one of ever have be a state out of the union the original one pass into the union even before cast off british colonial dependence and the new one each come into the union directly from a condition of dependence except texas and even texas in temporary independence be never designate a state the new one only take the designation of states on come into the union while that name be first adopt for the old one in and by the|declaration|of|independence therein the united|colony be declare to be free and independent state but even then the object plainly be not to declare independence of another or of the union but directly the contrary as mutual pledge and mutual action before at the time and afterwards abundantly show the express plighting of faith by each and all of the original in the|articles|of|confederation two|years|later that the union shall be perpetual be most conclusive have never be states either in substance or in name outside of the union whence this magical omnipotence of state right assert a claim of power to lawfully destroy the union much be say about the sovereignty of the states but the word even be not in the|national|constitution nor as be believe in any of the state constitution what be a sovereignty in the political sense of the term would be far wrong to define a political community without a political superior test by this no one of states except texas ever be a sovereignty and even texas give up the character on come into the union by which act acknowledge the|united|state and the law and treaty of the|united|state make in pursuance of the constitution to be for the supreme law of the land the states have status in the union and have no other legal status if break from this can only do so against law and by revolution the union and not separately procure independence and liberty by conquest or purchase the union give each of whatever of independence and liberty have the union be old than any of the states and in fact create as states originally some dependent colony make the union and in turn the union throw off old dependence for and make states such as be not of ever have a state constitution independent of the union of course be not forget that all the new states frame constitution before enter the union nevertheless dependent upon and preparatory to come into the union unquestionably the state have the power and right reserve to in and by the|national|constitution but among these surely be not include all conceivable power however mischievous or destructive but at most such only as be know in the world at the time as governmental power and certainly a power to destroy the government have never be know as a governmental as a merely administrative power this relative matter of national power and state right as a principle be no other than the principle of generality and locality whatever concern the whole should be confide to the whole to while whatever concern only the state should be leave exclusively to the state this be all there be of original principle about whether the|national|constitution in define boundary between the have apply the principle with exact accuracy be not to be question be all bind by that define without question what be now combated be the position that secession be consistent with the constitution be lawful and peaceful be not contend that there be any express law for and nothing should ever be imply as law which lead to unjust or absurd consequence the nation purchase with money the country out of which several of these states be form be just that shall go off without leave and without refund the nation pay very large sum in the aggregate believe nearly|a|hundred|millions to relieve florida of the aboriginal tribe be just that shall now be off without consent or without make any return the nation be now in debt for money apply to the benefit of these so call secede states in common with the rest be just either that creditor shall go unpaid or the remain states pay the whole a part of the present national debt be contract to pay the old debt of texas be just that shall leave and pay no part of this again if state may secede so may another and when all shall have secede none be leave to pay the debt be this quite just to creditor do notify of this sage view of when borrow money if now recognize this doctrine by allow the seceder to go in peace be difficult to see what can do if other choose to go or to extort term upon which will promise to remain the seceder insist that constitution admit of secession have assume to make a national constitution of own in which of necessity have either discard or retain the right of secession as insist exist in our if have discard thereby admit that on principle ought not to be in our if have retain by own construction of show that to be consistent must secede from another whenever shall find the easy way of settle debt or effect any other selfish or unjust object the principle be of disintegration and upon which no government can possibly endure if all the states save one should assert the power to drive that one out of the union be presume the whole class of seceder politician would at once deny the power and denounce the act as the great outrage upon state right but suppose that precisely the same act instead of be call drive the one out should be call the seceding of the other from that one would be exactly what the seceder claim to do unless indeed make the point that the one because be a minority may rightfully do what the other because be a majority may not rightfully do these politician be subtle and profound on the right of minority be not partial to that power which make the constitution and speak from the preamble call the people may well be question whether there be to day a majority of the legally qualified voter of any state except perhaps south|carolina in favor of disunion there be much reason to believe that the union man be the majority in many if not in every other one of the so call secede states the contrary have not be demonstrate in any of be venture to affirm this even of virginia and tennessee for the result of an election hold in military camp where the bayonet be all on side of the question vote upon can scarcely be consider as demonstrate popular sentiment at such an election all that large class who be at once for the union and against coercion would be coerce to vote against the union may be affirm without extravagance that the free institution enjoy have develop the power and improve the condition of whole people beyond any example in the world of this now have a striking and an impressive illustration so large an army as the government have now on foot be never before know without a soldier in but who have take place there of own free choice but more than this there be many single regiment whose member and another possess full practical knowledge of all the art science profession and whatever else whether useful or elegant be know in the world and there be scarcely from which there could not be select a president a cabinet a congress and perhaps a court abundantly competent to administer the government nor do say this be not true also in the army of late friend now adversary in this contest but if be so much well the reason why the government which have confer such benefit on both and should not be break up whoever in any section propose to abandon such a government would do well to consider in deference to what principle be that do what better be likely to get in stead whether the substitute will give or be intend to give so much of good to the people there be some foreshadowing on this subject adversary have adopt some declaration of independence in which unlike the good old pen by jefferson omit the word all man be create equal why have adopt a temporary national constitution in the preamble of which unlike good old sign by washington omit the people and substitute the deputy of the sovereign and independent states why why this deliberate press out of view the right of man and the authority of the people this be essentially a people 's contest on the side of the union be a struggle for maintain in the world that form and substance of government whose leading object be to elevate the condition of man to lift artificial weight from all shoulder to clear the path of laudable pursuit for all to afford all an unfettered start and a fair chance in the race of life yield to partial and temporary departure from necessity this be the lead object of the government for whose existence contend be most happy to believe that the plain people understand and appreciate this be worthy of note that while in this the government 's hour of trial large number of those in the army and navy who have be favor with the office have resign and prove false to the hand which have pamper not common soldier or common sailor be know to have desert flag great honor be due to those officer who remain true despite the example of treacherous associate but the great honor and most important fact of all be the unanimous firmness of the common soldier and common sailor to the last man so far as know have successfully resist the traitorous effort of those whose command but an hour before obey as absolute law this be the patriotic instinct of plain people understand without an argument that the destroy the government which be make by washington mean no good to popular government have often be call an experiment point in people have already settle the successful establishing and the successful administering of still remain successful maintenance against a formidable internal attempt to overthrow be now for to demonstrate to the world that those who can fairly carry an election can also suppress a rebellion that ballot be the rightful and peaceful successor of bullet and that when ballot have fairly and constitutionally decide there can be no successful appeal back to bullet that there can be no successful appeal except to ballot at succeed election such will be a great lesson of peace teach man that what can not take by an election neither can take by a war teach all the folly of be the beginner of a war lest there be some uneasiness in the mind of candid man as to what be to be the course of the government toward the|southern|state after the rebellion shall have be suppress the executive deem proper to say will be purpose then as ever to be guide by the constitution and the law and that probably will have no different understanding of the power and duty of the|federal|government relatively to the right of the states and the people under the constitution than that express in the inaugural address desire to preserve the government that may be administer for all as be administer by the man who make loyal citizen everywhere have the right to claim this of government and the government have no right to withhold or neglect be not perceive that in give there be any coercion any conquest or any subjugation in any just sense of those term the constitution provide and all the states have accept the provision that the|united|state shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government but if a state may lawfully go out of the union have do so may also discard the republican form of government so that to prevent go out be an indispensable mean to the end of maintain the guaranty mention and when an end be lawful and obligatory the indispensable mean to be also lawful and obligatory be with the deep regret that the executive find the duty of employ the war power in defense of the government force upon could but perform this duty or surrender the existence of the government no compromise by public servant could in this case be a cure not that compromise be not often proper but that no popular government can long survive a mark precedent that those who carry an election can only save the government from immediate destruction by give up the main point upon which the people give the election the people and not servant can safely reverse own deliberate decision as a private citizen the executive could not have consent that these institution shall perish much less could in betrayal of so vast and so sacred a trust as these free people have confide to feel that have no moral right to shrink nor even to count the chance of own life in what may follow in full view of great responsibility have so far do what have deem duty will now accord to own judgment perform sincerely hope that view and action may so accord with as to assure all faithful citizen who have be disturb in right of a certain and speedy restoration to under the constitution and the law and have thus choose course without guile and with pure purpose let renew trust in god and go forward without fear and with manly heart transcript fellow citizen of the|united|state in compliance with a custom as old as the government appear before to address briefly and to take in presence the oath prescribe by the|united|state to be take by the president before enter on the execution of office do not consider necessary at present for to discuss those matter of administration about which there be no special anxiety or excitement apprehension seem to exist among the people of the|southern|state that by the accession of a republican administration property and peace and personal security be to be endanger there have never be any reasonable cause for such apprehension indeed the most ample evidence to the contrary have all the while exist and be open to inspection be find in nearly all the publish speech of who now address do but quote from of those speech when declare that have no purpose directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where exist beheve have no lawful right to do so and have no inclination to do so those who nominate and elect do so with full knowledge that have make this and many similar declaration and have never recant and more than this place in the platform for acceptance and as a law to and to the clear and emphatic resolution which now read resolve that the maintenance inviolate of the right of the states and especially the right of each state to order and control own domestic institution accord to own judgment exclusively be essential to that balance of power on which the perfection and endurance of political fabric depend and denounce the lawless invasion by armed force of the soil of any state or territory no matter under what pretext as among the grave of crime now reiterate these sentiment and in do so only press upon the public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case be susceptible that the property peace and security of no section be to be in any wise endanger by the now incoming administration add too that all the protection which consistently with the constitution and the law can be give will be cheerfully give to all the states when lawfully demand for whatever cause as cheerfully to section as to another there be much controversy about the delivering up of fugitive from service or labor the clause now read be as plainly write in the constitution as any other of provision no person hold to service or labor in state under the law thereof escape into another shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharge from such service or labor but shall be deliver up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due be scarcely question that this provision be intend by those who make for the reclaiming of what call fugitive slave and the intention of the lawgiver be the law all member of congress swear support to the whole constitution to this provision as much as to any other to the proposition then that slave whose case come within the term of this clause shall be deliver up oath be unanimous now if would make the effort in good temper could not with nearly equal unanimity frame and pass a law by mean of which to keep good that unanimous oath there be some difference of opinion whether this clause should be enforce by national or by state authority but surely that difference be not a very material if the slave be to be surrender can be of but little consequence to or to other by which authority be do and should anyone in any case be content that oath shall go unkept on a merely unsubstantial controversy as to how shall be keep again in any law upon this subject ought not all the safeguard of liberty know in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduce so that a free man be not in any case surrender as a slave and may not be well at the same time to provide by law for the enforcement of that clause in the constitution which guarantee that the citizen of each state shall be entitle to all privilege and immunity of citizen in the several states take the official oath to day with no mental reservation and with no purpose to construe the constitution or law by any hypercritical rule and while do not choose now to specify particular act of congress as proper to be enforce do suggest that will be much safe for all both in official and private station to conform to and abide by all those act which stand unrepeale than to violate any of trust to find impunity in have hold to be unconstitutional be two|year since the first inauguration of a president under our|national|constitution during that period different and greatly distinguished citizen have in succession administer the executive branch of the government have conduct through many peril and generally with great success yet with all this scope of precedent now enter upon the same task for the brief constitutional term of four|year under great and peculiar difficulty a disruption of the|federal|union heretofore only menace be now formidably attempt hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the constitution the|union|of|these|states be perpetual perpetuity be imply if not express in the fundamental law of all national government be safe to assert that no government proper ever have a provision in organic law for own termination continue to execute all the express provision of our|national|constitution and the union will endure forever be impossible to destroy except by some action not provide for in the instrument again if the|united|state be not a government proper but an association of states in the nature of contract merely can as a contract be peaceably unmade by less than all the party who make party to a contract may violate — break so to speak but do not require all to lawfully rescind descend from these general principle find the proposition that in legal contemplation the union be perpetual confirm by the history of the union the union be much old than the constitution be form in fact by in be mature and continue by the|declaration|of|independence in be further mature and the faith of all the then states expressly plight and engage that should be perpetual by the|articles|of|confederation in and finally in of the declare object for ordaining and establish the constitution be to form a more perfect union but if the destruction of the union by or by a part only of the states be lawfully possible the union be less perfect than before the constitution have lose the vital element of perpetuity follow from these view that no state upon own mere motion can lawfully get out of the union that resolve and ordinance to that effect be legally void and that act of violence within any state or states against the authority of the|united|state be insurrectionary or revolutionary accord to circumstance therefore consider that in view of the constitution and the law the union be unbroken and to the extent of ability shall take care as the constitution expressly enjoin upon that the law of the union be faithfully execute in all the states do this deem to be only a simple duty on part and shall perform so far as practicable unless rightful master the american people shall withhold the requisite mean or in some authoritative manner direct the contrary trust this will not be regard as a menace but only as the declare purpose of the union that will constitutionally defend and maintain in do this there need to be no bloodshed or violence and there shall be none unless be force upon the national authority the power confide to will be use to hold occupy and possess the property and place belong to the government and to collect the duty and impost but beyond what may be necessary for these object there will be no invasion no using of force against or among the people anywhere where hostility to the|united|state in any interior locality shall be so great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizen from hold the federal office there will be no attempt to force obnoxious stranger among the people for that object while the strict legal right may exist in the government to enforce the exercise of these office the attempt to do so would be so irritate and so nearly impracticable withal that deem better to forego for the time the us of such office the mail unless repel will continue to be furnish in all part of the union so far as possible the people everywhere shall have that sense of perfect security which be most favorable to calm thought and reflection the course here indicate will be follow unless current event and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper and in every case and exigency good discretion will be exercise accord to circumstance actually exist and with a view and a hope of a peaceful solution of the national trouble and the restoration of fraternal sympathy and affection that there be person in section or another who seek to destroy the union at all event and be glad of any pretext to do will neither affirm nor deny but if there be such need address no word to to those however who really love the union may not speak before enter upon so grave a matter as the destruction of national fabric with all benefit memory and hope would not be wise to ascertain precisely why do will hazard so desperate a step while there be any possibility that any portion of the ill fly from have no real existence will while the certain ill fly to be great than all the real one fly from — will risk the commission of so fearful a mistake all profess to be content in the union if all constitutional right can be maintain be true then that any right plainly write in the constitution have be deny think not happily the human mind be so constitute that no party can reach to the audacity of do this think if can of a single instance in which a plainly write provision of the constitution have ever be deny if by the mere force of number a majority should deprive a minority of any clearly write constitutional right may in a moral point of view justify revolution certainly would if such a right be a vital but such be not case all the vital right of minority and of individual be so plainly assure to by affirmation and negation guarantee and prohibition in the constitution that controversy never arise concern but no organic law can ever be frame with a provision specifically applicable to every question which may occur in practical administration no foresight can anticipate nor any document of reasonable length contain express provision for all possible question shall fugitive from labor be surrender by national or by state authority the constitution do not expressly say may congress prohibit slavery in the territories the constitution do not expressly say must congress protect slavery in the territories the constitution do not expressly say from question of this class spring all constitutional controversy and divide upon into majority and minority if the minority will not acquiesce the majority must or the government must cease there be no other alternative for continue the government be acquiescence on side or the other if a minority in such case will secede rather than acquiesce make a precedent which in turn will divide and ruin for a minority of own will secede from whenever a majority refuse to be control by such minority for instance why may not any portion of a new confederacy a|year or hence arbitrarily secede again precisely as portion of the present union now claim to secede from all who cherish disunion sentiment be now be educate to the exact temper of do this be there such perfect identity of interest among the states to compose a new union as to produce harmony only and prevent renew secession plainly the central idea of secession be the essence of anarchy a majority hold in restraint by constitutional check and limitation and always change easily with deliberate change of popular opinion and sentiment be the only true sovereign of a free people whoever reject do of necessity fly to anarchy or to despotism unanimity be impossible the rule of a minority as a permanent arrangement be wholly inadmissible so that reject the majority principle anarchy or despotism in some form be all that be leave do not forget the position assume by some that constitutional question be to be decide by the|supreme|court nor do deny that such decision must be bind in any case upon the party to a suit as to the object of that suit while be also entitle to very high respect and consideration in all parallel case by all other department of the government and while be obviously possible that such decision may be erroneous in any give case still the evil effect follow be limit to that particular case with the chance that may be overrule and never become a precedent for other case can better be bear than could the evil of a different practice at the same time the candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the government upon vital question affect the whole people be to be irrevocably fix by decision of the|supreme|court the instant be make in ordinary litigation between party in personal action the people will have cease to be own ruler have to that extent practically resign government into the hand of that eminent tribunal nor be there in this view any assault upon the court or the judge be a duty from which may not shrink to decide case properly bring before and be no fault of if other seek to turn decision to political purpose section of country believe slavery be right and ought to be extend while the other believe be wrong and ought not to be extend this be the only substantial dispute the fugitive slave clause of the constitution and the law for the suppression of the foreign slave trade be each as well enforce perhaps as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly support the law the great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both case and a few break over in each this think can not be perfectly cure and would be bad in both case after the separation of the section than before the foreign slave trade now imperfectly suppress would be ultimately revive without restriction in section while fugitive slave now only partially surrender would not be surrender at all by the other physically speak can not separate can not remove respective section from each other nor build an impassable wall between a husband and wife may be divorce and go out of the presence and beyond the reach of each other but the different part of country can not do this can not but remain face to face and intercourse either amicable or hostile must continue between be possible then to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before can alien make treaty easy than friend can make law can treaty be more faithfully enforce between alien than law can among friend suppose go to war can not fight always and when after much loss on both side and no gain on either cease fight the identical old question as to term of intercourse be again upon this country with institution belong to the people who inhabit whenever shall grow weary of the exist government can exercise constitutional right of amend or revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow can not be ignorant of the fact that many worthy and patriotic citizen be desirous of have the|national|constitution amend while make no recommendation of amendment fully recognize the rightful authority of the people over the whole subject to be exercise in either of the mode prescribe in the instrument and should under exist circumstance favor rather than oppose a fair opportunity be afford the people to act upon will venture to add that to the convention mode seem preferable in that allow amendment to originate with the people instead of only permit to take or reject proposition originate by other not especially choose for the purpose and which may not be precisely such as would wish to either accept or refuse understand a propose amendment to the constitution — which amendment however have not see — have pass congress to the effect that the|federal|government shall never interfere with the domestic institution of the states include that of person hold to service to avoid misconstruction of what have say depart from purpose not to speak of particular amendment so far as to say that hold such a provision to now be imply constitutional law have no objection to being make express and irrevocable the chief magistrate derive all authority from the people and have confer none upon to fix term for the separation of the states the people can do this also if choose but the executive as such have nothing to do with duty be to administer the present government as come to hand and to transmit unimpaire by to successor why should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of the people be there any well or equal hope in the world in present difference be either party without faith of be in the right if the|almighty|ruler|of|nation with eternal truth and justice be on side of the north or on your of the south that truth and that justice will surely prevail by the judgment of this great tribunal of the american people by the frame of the government under which live this same people have wisely give public servant but little power for mischief and have with equal wisdom provide for the return of that little to own hand at very short interval while the people retain virtue and vigilance no administration by any extreme of wickedness or folly can very seriously injure the government in the short space of four|years countryman and all think calmly and well upon this whole subject nothing valuable can be lose by take time if there be an object to hurry any of in hot haste to a step which would never take deliberately that object will be frustrate by take time but no good object can be frustrate by such of as be now dissatisfied still have the old constitution unimpaire and on the sensitive point the law of own framing under while the new administration will have no immediate power if would to change either if be admit that who be dissatisfied hold the right side in the dispute

the|government|of the|united|state however strong may be desire to enter into such an agreement be convinced that do not possess the power congress and congress alone under the war make power can exercise the discretion of agree to abstain from any and all act calculate to produce a collision of arm between this and any other government would therefore be a usurpation for the executive to attempt to restrain hand by an agreement in regard to matter over which have no constitutional control if be thus to act may pass law which should be bind to obey though in conflict with agreement under exist circumstance present actual power be confine within narrow limit be duty at all time to defend and protect the public property within the secede states so far as this may be practicable and especially to employ all constitutional mean to protect the property of the|united|state and to preserve the public peace at this the seat of the|federal|government if the secede states abstain from any and all act calculate to produce a collision of arm then the danger so much to be deprecate will no longer exist defense and not aggression have be the policy of the administration from the beginning but whilst can enter into no engagement such as that propose cordially commend to congress with much confidence that will meet approbation to abstain from pass any law calculate to produce a collision of arm pende the proceeding contemplate by the action of the general assembly of virginia be of those who will never despair of the republic yet cherish the belief that the american people will perpetuate the|union|of|the|states on some term just and honorable for all section of the country trust that the mediation of virginia may be the destine mean under providence of accomplish this inestimable benefit glorious as be the memory of past history such an achievement both in relation to own fame and the welfare of the whole country would surpass all transcript at the opening of present session call attention to the danger which threaten the existence of the union express opinion freely concern the original cause of those danger and recommend such measure as believe would have the effect of tranquilize the country and save from the peril in which have be needlessly and most unfortunately involve those opinion and recommendation do not propose now to repeat own conviction upon the whole subject remain unchanged the fact that a great calamity be impend over the nation be even at that time acknowledge by every intelligent citizen have already make feel throughout the length and breadth of the land the necessary consequence of the alarm thus produce be most deplorable the import fall off with a rapidity never know before except in time of war in the history of foreign commerce the treasury be unexpectedly leave without the mean which have reasonably count upon to meet the public engagement trade be paralyze manufacture be stop the good public security suddenly sink in the market every specie of property depreciate more or less and thousand of poor man who depend upon daily labor for daily bread be turn out of employment deeply regret that be not able to give any information upon the state of the union which be more satisfactory than what be then oblige to communicate on the contrary matter be still bad at present than then be when congress meet a stronge hope pervade the whole public mind that some amicable adjustment of the subject would speedily be make by the representative of the states and of the people which may restore peace between the conflicting section of the country that hope have be diminish by every|hour of delay and as the prospect of a bloodless settlement fade away the public distress become more and more aggravated as evidence of this be only necessary to say that the treasury note authorize by the|act|of|17th|of|december last be advertise accord to the law and that no responsible bidder offer to take any considerable sum at par at a low rate of interest|than|12 per cent from these fact appear that in a government organize like ours domestic strife or even a well ground fear of civil hostility be more destructive to public and private interest than the most formidable foreign war in annual message express the conviction which have long deliberately hold and which recent reflection have only tend to deepen and confirm that no state have a right by own act to secede from the union or throw off federal obligation at pleasure also declare opinion to be that even if that right exist and should be exercise by any state of the confederacy the executive department of this government have no authority under the constitution to recognize validity by acknowledge the independence of such state this leave no alternative as the chief executive officer under the|united|state but to collect the public revenue and to protect the public property so far as this may be practicable under exist law this be still purpose province be to execute and not to make the law belong to congress exclusively to repeal to modify or to enlarge provision to meet exigency as may occur possess no dispense power certainly have no right to make aggressive war upon any state and be perfectly satisfied that the constitution have wisely withhold that power even from congress but the right and the duty to use military force defensively against those who resist the federal officer in the execution of legal function and against those who assail the property of the|federal|government be clear and undeniable but the dangerous and hostile attitude of the states toward each other have already far transcend and cast in the shade the ordinary executive duty already provide for by law and have assume such vast and alarming proportion as to place the subject entirely above and beyond executive control the fact can not be disguise that be in the midst of a great revolution in all various bearing therefore commend the question to congress as the only human tribunal under providence possess the power to meet the exist emergency to exclusively belong the power to declare war or to authorize the employment of military force in all case contemplate by the constitution and alone possess the power to remove grievance which may lead to war and to secure peace and union to this distracted country on and on alone rest the responsibility the union be a sacred trust leave by revolutionary father to descendant and never do any other people inherit so rich a legacy have render prosperous in peace and triumphant in war the national flag have float in glory over every sea under shadow american citizen have find protection and respect in all land beneath the sun if descend to consideration of purely material interest when in the history of all time have a confederacy be bind together by such strong tie of mutual interest each portion of be dependent on all and all upon each portion for prosperity and domestic security free trade throughout the whole supply the want of portion from the production of another and scatter wealth everywhere the great planting and farm state require the aid of the commercial and navigate states to send production to domestic and foreign market and to furnish the naval power to render transportation secure against all hostile attack should the union perish in the midst of the present excitement have already have a sad foretaste of the universal suffering which would result from destruction the calamity would be severe in every portion of the union and would be quite as great to say the least in the southern as in the|northern|states the great aggravation of the evil and that which would place in the most unfavorable light both before the world and posterity be as be firmly convince that the secession movement have be chiefly base upon a misapprehension at the south of the sentiment of the majority in several of the|northern|states let the question be transfer from political assembly to the ballot box and the people would speedily redress the serious grievance which the south have suffer but in heaven 's name let the trial be make before plunge into armed conflict upon the mere assumption that there be no other alternative time be a great conservative power let pause at this momentous point and afford the people both north|and|south an opportunity for reflection would that south|carolina have be convince of this truth before precipitate action therefore appeal through to the people of the country to declare in might that the union must and shall be preserve by all constitutional mean most earnestly recommend that devote yourself exclusively to the question how this can be accomplish in peace all other question when compare to this sink into insignificance the present be no time for palliation action prompt action be require a delay in congress to prescribe or to recommend a distinct and practical proposition for conciliation may drive to a point from which will be almost impossible to recede a common ground on which conciliation and harmony can be produce be surely not unattainable the proposition to compromise by let the north have exclusive control of the territory above a certain line and to give southern institution protection below that line ought to receive universal approbation in indeed may not be entirely satisfactory but when the alternative be between a reasonable concession on both side and a destruction of the union be an imputation upon the patriotism of congress to assert that member will hesitate for a moment even now the danger be upon in several of the states which have not yet secede the fort arsenal and magazine of the|united|state have be seize this be by far the most serious step which have be take since the commencement of the trouble this public property have long be leave without garrison and troop for protection because no person doubt security under the flag of the country in any state of the union besides small army have scarcely be sufficient to guard remote frontier against indian incursion the seizure of this property from all appearance have be purely aggressive and not in resistance to any attempt to coerce a state or states to remain in the union at the beginning of these unhappy trouble determine that no act of should increase the excitement in either section of the country if the political conflict be to end in a civil war be determined purpose not to commence nor even to furnish an excuse for by any act of this government opinion remain unchanged that justice as well as sound policy require still to seek a peaceful solution of the question at issue between the north and the south entertain this conviction refrain even from send reenforcement to major anderson who command the fort in charleston|harbor until an absolute necessity for do so should make apparent lest may unjustly be regard as a menace of military coercion and thus furnish if not a provocation at least a pretext for an outbreak on the part of south|carolina no necessity for these reenforcement seem to exist be assure by distinguished and upright gentleman of south|carolina that no attack upon major anderson be intend but that on the contrary be the desire of the state authority as much as be own to avoid the fatal consequence which must eventually follow a military collision and here deem proper to submit for information copy of a communication date december|28,|1860 address to by r.w.|barnwell j.|h.|adams and james|l.|orr commissioner from south|carolina with the accompany document and copy of answer thereto date december|31 in further explanation of major anderson 's removal from fort|moultrie to fort|sumter be proper to state that after answer to the|south|carolina commissioner the|war|department receive a letter from that gallant officer date on the|27th|of|december,|1860 the|day after this movement from which the following be an extract will add as opinion that many thing convince that the authority of the state design to proceed to a hostile act evidently refer to the order date december|11 of the late secretary of war under this impression could not hesitate that be solemn duty to move command from a fort which could not probably have hold longer than eight|or|sixty|hour to this one where power of resistance be increase to a very great degree will be recollect that the conclude part of these order be in the follow term the smallness of force will not permit perhaps to occupy of the fort but an attack on or attempt to take possession of either of will be regard as an act of hostility and may then put command into either of which may deem most proper to increase power of resistance be also authorize to take similar defensive step whenever have tangible evidence of a design to proceed to a hostile act transcript fellow citizens of the senate and house|of|representatif throughout the|year since last meeting the country have be eminently prosperous in all material interest the general health have be excellent harvest have be abundant and plenty smile throughout the laud commerce and manufacture have be prosecute with energy and industry and have yield fair and ample return in short no nation in the tide of time have ever present a spectacle of great material prosperity than have do until within a very recent period why be then that discontent now so extensively prevail and the|union|of|the|states which be the source of all these blessing be threaten with destruction the long continue and intemperate interference of the northern people with the question of slavery in the|southern|state have at length produce natural effect the different section of the union be now array against each other and the time have arrive so much dread by the|father|of|his country when hostile geographical party have be form have long foresee and often forewarn countryman of the now impend danger this do not proceed solely from the claim on the part of congress or the territorial legislature to exclude slavery from the territories nor from the effort of different states to defeat the execution of the fugitive slave law all or any of these evil may have be endure by the south without danger to the union as other have be in the hope that time and reflection may apply the remedy the immediate peril arise not so much from these cause as from the fact that the incessant and violent agitation of the slavery question throughout the north for the|last|quarter|of|a|century have at length produce malign influence on the slave and inspire with vague notion of freedom hence a sense of security no longer exist around the family altar this feeling of peace at home have give place to apprehension of servile insurrection many a matron throughout the south retire at night in dread of what may befall and child before the|morn should this apprehension of domestic danger whether real or imaginary extend and intensify until shall pervade the masse of the southern people then disunion will become inevitable self preservation be the first law of nature and have be implant in the heart of man by creator for the wise purpose and no political union however fraught with blessing and benefit in all other respect can long continue if the necessary consequence be to render the home and the fireside of nearly|half the party to habitually and hopelessly insecure sooner or later the bond of such a union must be sever be conviction that this fatal period have not yet arrive and prayer to god be that would preserve the constitution and the union throughout all generation but let take warn in time and remove the cause of danger can not be deny that for five|and|twenty|year the agitation at the north against slavery have be incessant in pictorial handbill and inflammatory appeal be circulate extensively throughout the south of a character to excite the passion of the slave and in the language of general jackson to stimulate to insurrection and produce all the horror of a servile war this agitation have ever since be continue by the public press by the proceeding of state and county convention and by abolition sermon and lecture the time of congress have be occupy in violent speech on this never end subject and appeal in pamphlet and other form indorse by distinguished name have be send forth from this central point and spread broadcast over the union how easy would be for the american people to settle the slavery question forever and to restore peace and harmony to this distracted country and alone can do all that be necessary to accomplish the object and all for which the slave state have ever contend be to be let alone and permit to manage domestic institution in own way as sovereign states and alone be responsible before god and the world for the slavery exist among for this the people of the north be not more responsible and have no more fight to interfere than with similar institution in russia or in brazil upon good sense and patriotic forbearance confes still greatly rely without aid be beyond the power of any president no matter what may be own political proclivity to restore peace and harmony among the states wisely limited and restrain as be power under constitution and law alone can accomplish but little for good or for evil on such a momentous question and this bring to observe that the election of any of fellow citizen to the office of president do not of afford just cause for dissolve the union this be more especially true if election have be effect by a mere plurality and not a majority of the people and have result from transient and temporary cause which may probably never again occur in order to justify a resort to revolutionary resistance the|federal|government must be guilty of a deliberate palpable and dangerous exercise of power not grant by the constitution the late presidential election however have be hold in strict conformity with express provision how then can the result justify a revolution to destroy this very constitution reason justice a regard for the constitution all require that shall wait for some overt and dangerous act on the part of the president elect before resort to such a remedy be say however that the antecedent of the president elect have be sufficient to justify the fear of the south that will attempt to invade constitutional right but be such apprehension of contingent danger in the future sufficient to justify the immediate destruction of the noble system of government ever devise by mortal from the very nature of office and high responsibility must necessarily be conservative the stern duty of administer the vast and complicated concern of this government afford in a guaranty that will not attempt any violation of a clear constitutional right after all be no more than the chief executive officer of the government province be not to make but to execute the law and be a remarkable fact in history that notwithstanding the repeat effort of the antislavery party no single act have ever pass congress unless may possibly except the missouri compromise impair in the slight degree the right of the south to property in slave and may also be observe judge from present indication that no probability exist of the passage of such an act by a majority of both houses either in the present or the next congress surely under these circumstance ought to be restrain from present action by the precept of who spake as man never speak that sufficient unto the|day be the evil thereof the|day of evil may never come unless shall rashly bring upon be allege as cause for immediate secession that the|southern|states be deny equal right with the other states in the common territories but by what authority be these deny not by congress which have never pass and believe never will pass any act to exclude slavery from these territories and certainly not by the|supreme|court which have solemnly decide that slave be property and like all other property owner have a right to take into the common territories and hold there under the protection of the constitution so far then as congress be concern the objection be not to anything have already do but to what may do hereafter will surely be admit that this apprehension of future danger be no good reason for an immediate dissolution of the union be true that the territorial legislature of kansas on the 23d february pass in great haste an act over the veto of the governor declare that slavery be and shall be forever prohibit in this territory such an act however plainly violate the right of property secure by the constitution will surely be declare void by the judiciary whenever shall be present in a legal form only|three|days after inauguration the|supreme|court of the|united|state solemnly adjudge that this power do not exist in a territorial legislature yet such have be the factious temper of the time that the correctness of this decision have be extensively impugn before the people and the question have give rise to angry political conflict throughout the country those who have appeal from this judgment of high constitutional tribunal to popular assembly would if could invest a territorial legislature with power to annul the sacred right of property this power congress be expressly forbid by the|federal|constitution to exercise every state legislature in the union be forbid by own constitution to exercise can not be exercise in any state except by the people in high sovereign capacity when frame or amend state constitution in like manner can only be exercise by the people of a territory represent in a convention of delegate for the purpose of frame a constitution preparatory to admission as a state into the union then and not until then be invest with power to decide the question whether slavery shall or shall not exist within limit this be an act of sovereign authority and not of subordinate territorial legislation be otherwise then indeed would the equality of the|state in the territories be destroy and the right of property in slave would depend not upon the guaranty of the constitution but upon the shift majority of an irresponsible territorial legislature such a doctrine from intrinsic unsoundness can not long influence any considerable portion of people much less can afford a good reason for a dissolution of the union the most palpable violation of constitutional duty which have yet be commit consist in the act of different state legislature to defeat the execution of the fugitive slave law ought to be remember however that for these act neither congress nor any president can justly be hold responsible have be pass in violation of the|federal|constitution be therefore null and void all the court both state and national before whom the question have arise have from the beginning declare the fugitive slave law to be constitutional the single exception be that of a state court in wisconsin and this have not only be reverse by the proper appellate tribunal but have meet with such universal reprobation that there can be no danger from as a precedent the validity of this law have be establish over and over again by the|supreme|court of the|united|state with perfect unanimity be round upon an express provision of the constitution require that fugitive slave who escape from service in state to another shall be deliver up to master without this provision be a well know historical fact that the constitution could never have be adopt by the convention in form or other under the act of and both be substantially the same the fugitive slave law have be the law of the land from the|day of washington until the present moment here then a clear case be present in which will be the duty of the next president as have be own to act with vigor in execute this supreme law against the conflict enactment of state legislature should fail in the performance of this high duty will then have manifest a disregard of the constitution and law to the great injury of the people of nearly|one half of of the union but be to presume in advance that will thus violate duty this would be at war with every principle of justice and of christian charity let wait for the overt act the fugitive slave law have be carry into execution in every contest case since the commencement of the present administration though often be to be regret with great loss and inconvenience to the master and with considerable expense to the government let trust that the state legislature will repeal unconstitutional and obnoxious enactment unless this shall be do without unnecessary delay be impossible for any human power to save the union the|southern|state stand on the basis of the constitution have right to demand this act of justice from the|state of the north should be refuse then the constitution to which all the states be party will have be willfully violate by portion of in a provision essential to the domestic security and happiness of the remainder in that event the injure states after have first use all peaceful and constitutional mean to obtain redress would be justify in revolutionary resistance to the|government|of|the|union have purposely confine remark to revolutionary resistance because have be claim within the|last|few|year that any state whenever this shall be sovereign will and pleasure may secede from the union in accordance with the constitution and without any violation of the constitutional right of the other member of the confederacy that as each become party to the union by the vote of own people assemble in convention so any of may retire from the union in a similar manner by the vote of such a convention in order to justify secession as a constitutional remedy must be on the principle that be a mere voluntary association of states to be dissolve at pleasure by any of the contracting party if this be so the confederacy be a rope of sand to be penetrate and dissolve by the first adverse wave of public opinion in any of the|state in this manner state may resolve into as many petty jar and hostile republic each one retire from the union without responsibility whenever any sudden excitement may impel to such a course by this process a union may be entirely break into fragment in a|few|week which cost forefather many|year of toil privation and blood to establish such a principle be wholly inconsistent with the history as well as the character of the|federal|constitution after be frame with the great deliberation and care be submit to convention of the people of the several states for ratification provision be discuss at length in these body compose of the first man of the country opponent contend that confer power upon the|federal|government dangerous to the right of the states whilst advocate maintain that under a fair construction of the instrument there be no foundation for such apprehension in that mighty struggle between the first intellect of this or any other country never occur to any individual either among opponent or advocate to assert or even to intimate that effort be all vain labor because the moment that any state feel aggrieve may secede from the union what a crush argument would this have prove against those who dread that the right of the states would be endanger by the constitution the truth be that be not until many|year after the origin of that such a proposition be first advanced be then meet and refute by the conclusive argument of general jackson who in message of the|16th|of|january,|1833 transmit the nullifying ordinance of south|carolina to congress employ the follow language the right of the people of a single state to absolve at will and without the consent of the other states from most solemn obligation and hazard the liberty and happiness of the million compose this union can not be acknowledge such authority be believe to be utterly repugnant both to the principle upon which the|general|government be constitute and to the object which be expressly form to attain be not pretend that any clause in the constitution give countenance to such a theory be altogether round upon inference not from any language contain in the instrument but from the sovereign character of the several states by which be ratified but be beyond the power of a state like an individual to yield a portion of sovereign right to secure the remainder in the language of mr. madison who have be call the father of the constitution-- be form by the states that is by the people in each of the states act in high sovereign capacity and form consequently by the same authority which form the state constitution nor be the government of the|united|state create by the constitution less a government in the strict sense of the term within the sphere of power than the government create by the constitution of the states be within several sphere be like organize into legislative executive and judiciary department operate like directly on person and thing and like have at command a physical force for execute the power commit to be intend to be perpetual and not to be annul at the pleasure of any of the contracting party the old articles|of|confederation be entitle articles|of|confederation|and|perpetual|union between the states and by the thirteenth article be expressly declare that the article of this confederation shall be inviolably observe by every state and the union shall be perpetual the preamble to the|united|state have express reference to the|articles|of|confederation recite that be establish in order to form a more perfect union and yet be contend that this more perfect union do not include the essential attribute of perpetuity but that the union be design to be perpetual appear conclusively from the nature and extent of the power confer by these power embrace the very high attribute of national sovereignty place both the sword and the purse under control congress have power to make war and to make peace to raise and support army and navy and to conclude treaty with foreign government be invest with the power to coin money and to regulate the value thereof and to regulate commerce with foreign nation and among the several states be not necessary to enumerate the other high power which have be confer upon in order to carry the enumerate power into effect congress possess the exclusive right to lay and collect duty on import and in common with the states to lay and collect all other taxis but the constitution have not only confer these high power upon congress but have adopt effectual mean to restrain the states from interfere with exercise for that purpose have in strong prohibitory language expressly declare no state shall enter into any treaty alliance or confederation grant letter of marque and reprisal coin money emit bill of credit make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debt pass any bill of attainder law or law impair the obligation of contract no state shall without the consent of the congress lie any impost or duty on import or export except what may be absolutely necessary for execute inspection law and if exceed this amount the excess shall belong to the|united|state and-- no state shall without the consent of congress lie any duty of tonnage keep troop or ship of war in time of peace enter into any agreement or compact with another state or with a foreign power or engage in war unless actually invade or in such imminent danger as will not admit of delay in order still further to secure the uninterrupted exercise of these high power against state interposition be provide this constitution and the law of the|united|state which shall be make in pursuance thereof and all treaty make or which shall be make under the authority of the|united|state shall be the supreme law of the land and the judge in every state shall be bind thereby anything in the constitution or law of any state to the contrary notwithstanding the solemn sanction of religion have be superadde to the obligation of official duty and all senators and representatives of the|united|state all member of state legislature and all executive and judicial officer both of the|united|state and of the several states shall be bind by oath or affirmation to support this constitution in order to carry into effect these power the constitution have establish a perfect government in all form legislative executive and judicial and this government to the extent of power act directly upon the individual citizen of every state and execute own decree by the agency of own officer in this respect differ entirely from the government under the old confederation which be confine to make requisition on the states in sovereign character this leave in the discretion of each whether to obey or to refuse and often decline to comply with such requisition thus become necessary for the purpose of remove this barrier and in order to form a more perfect union to establish a government which could act directly upon the people and execute own law without the intermediate agency of the states this have be accomplish by the|united|state in short the government create by the constitution and derive authority from the sovereign people of each of the several states have precisely the same right to exercise power over the people of all these states in in the enumerate case that each of possess over subject not delegate to the|united|state but reserve to the states respectively or to the people to the extent of the delegate power the|united|state be as much a part of the constitution of each state and be as bind upon people as though have be textually insert therein this government therefore be a great and powerful government invest with all the attribute of sovereignty over the special subject to which authority extend framer never intend to implant in bosom the seed of own destruction nor be at creation guilty of the absurdity of provide for own dissolution be not intend by framer to be the baseless fabric of a vision which at the touch of the enchanter would vanish into thin air but a substantial and mighty fabric capable of resist the slow decay of time and of defy the storm of age indeed well may the jealous patriot of that|day have indulge fear that a government of such high power may violate the reserve right of the states and wisely do adopt the rule of a strict construction of these power to prevent the danger but do not fear nor have any reason to imagine that the constitution would ever be so interpret as to enable any state by own act and without the consent of sister states to discharge people from all or any of federal obligation may be ask then be the people of the states without redress against the tyranny and oppression of the|federal|government by no mean the right of resistance on the part of the govern against the oppression of government can not be deny exist independently of all constitution and have be exercise at all period of the world 's history under old government have be destroy and new one have take place be embody in strong and express language in own declaration|of|independence but the distinction must ever be observe that this be revolution against an establish government and not a voluntary secession from by virtue of an inherent constitutional right in short let look the danger fairly in the face secession be neither more nor less than revolution may or may not be a justifiable revolution but still be revolution what in the meantime be the responsibility and true position of the executive be bind by solemn oath before god and the country to take care that the law be faithfully execute and from this obligation can not be absolve by any human power but what if the performance of this duty in whole or in part have be render impracticable by event over which could have exercise no control such at the present moment be the case throughout the|state|of|south|carolina so far as the law of the|united|state to secure the administration of justice by mean of the federal judiciary be concern all the federal officer within limit through whose agency alone these law can be carry into execution have already resign no longer have a district judge a district attorney or a marshal in south|carolina in fact the whole machinery of the federal|government necessary for the distribution of remedial justice among the people have be demolish and would be difficult if not impossible to replace the only act of congress on the statute book bear upon this subject be those of february|28,|1795,|and|march|3,|1807 these authorize the president after shall have ascertain that the marshal with posse comitatus be unable to execute civil or criminal process in any particular case to call forth the militia and employ the army and navy to aid in perform this service have first by proclamation command the insurgent to disperse and retire peaceably to respective abode within a limited time this duty can not by possibility be perform in a state where no judicial authority exist to issue process and where there be no marshal to execute and where even if there be such an officer the entire population would constitute solid combination to resist the bare enumeration of these provision prove how inadequate be without further legislation to overcome a united opposition in a single state not to speak of other states who may place in a similar attitude congress alone have power to decide whether the present law can or can not be amend so as to carry out more effectually the object of the constitution the same insuperable obstacle do not lie in the way of execute the law for the collection of the custom the revenue still continue to be collect as heretofore at the custom house in charleston and should the collector unfortunately resign a successor may be appoint to perform this duty then in regard to the property of the|united|state in south|carolina this have be purchase for a fair equivalent by the consent of the legislature of the state for the erection of fort magazine arsenal and over these the authority to exercise exclusive legislation have be expressly grant by the constitution to congress be not believe that any attempt will be make to expel the|united|state from this property by force but if in this should prove to be mistake the officer in command of the fort have receive order to act strictly on the defensive in such a contingency the responsibility for consequence would rightfully rest upon the head of the assailant apart from the execution of the law so far as this may be practicable the executive have no authority to decide what shall be the relation between the|federal|government and south|carolina have be invest with no such discretion possess no power to change the relation heretofore exist between much less to acknowledge the independence of that state this would be to invest a mere executive officer with the power of recognize the dissolution of the confederacy among sovereign states bear no resemblance to the recognition of a foreign government involve no such responsibility any attempt to do this would on part be a naked act of usurpation be therefore duty to submit to congress the whole question in all beating the course of event be so rapidly hasten forward that the emergency may soon arise when may be call upon to decide the momentous question whether possess the power by force of arm to compel a state to remain in the union should feel recreant to duty be not to express an opinion on this important subject the question fairly state be have the constitution delegate to congress the power to coerce a state into submission which be attempt to withdraw or have actually withdraw from the confederacy if answer in the affirmative must be on the principle that the power have be confer upon congress to declare and to make war against a state after much serious reflection have arrive at the conclusion that no such power have be delegate to congress or to any other department of the|federal|government be manifest upon an inspection of the constitution that this be not among the specific and enumerate power grant to congress and be equally apparent that exercise be not necessary and proper for carry into execution any of these power so far from this power have be delegate to congress be expressly refuse by the convention which frame the constitution appear from the proceeding of that body that on the|31st|may,|1787 the clause authorize an exertion of the force of the whole against a delinquent state come up for consideration mr. madison oppose in a brief but powerful speech from which shall extract but a single sentence observe the use of force against a state would look more like a declaration of war than an infliction of punishment and would probably be consider by the party attack as a dissolution of all previous compact by which may be bind upon motion the clause be unanimously postpone and be never believe again present soon afterwards on when incidentally advert to the subject say any government for the|united|state form on the suppose practicability of use force against the unconstitutional proceeding of the states would prove as visionary and fallacious as the government of congress evidently mean the then exist congress of the old confederation without descend to particular may be safely assert that the power to make war against a state be at variance with the whole spirit and intent of the constitution suppose such a war should result in the conquest of a state how be to govern afterwards shall hold as a province and govern by despotic power in the nature of thing could not by physical force control the will of the people and compel to elect senators|and|representative to congress and to perform all the other duty depend upon own volition and require from the free citizen of a free state as a constituent member of the confederacy but if possess this power would be wise to exercise under exist circumstance the object would doubtless be to preserve the union war would not only present the most effectual mean of destroy but would vanish all hope of peaceable reconstruction besides in the fraternal conflict a vast amount of blood and treasure would be expend render future reconciliation between the states impossible in the meantime who can foretell what would be the suffering and privation of the people during existence the fact be that union rest upon public opinion and can never be cement by the blood of citizen shed in civil war if can not live in the affection of the people must one|day perish congress possess many mean of preserve by conciliation but the sword be not place in hand to preserve by force but may be permit solemnly to invoke countryman to pause and deliberate before determine to destroy this the grandest temple which have ever be dedicate to human freedom since the world begin have be consecrate by the blood of father by the glory of the past and by the hope of the future the union have already make the most prosperous and ere long will if preserve render the most powerful nation on the face of the earth in every foreign region of the globe the title of american citizen be hold in the high respect and when pronounce in a foreign land cause the heart of countryman to swell with honest pride surely when reach the brink of the yawning abyss shall recoil with horror from the last fatal plunge by such a dread catastrophe the hope of the friend of freedom throughout the world would be destroy and of leaden despotism would enshroud the nation example for more|than|eighty|year would not only be lose but would be quote as a conclusive proof that man be unfit for self government be not every wrong nay be not every grievous wrong which can justify a resort to such a fearful alternative this ought to be the last desperate remedy of a despair people after every other constitutional mean of conciliation have be exhaust should reflect that under this free government there be an incessant ebb and flow in public opinion the slavery question like everything human will have firmly believe that have reach and pass the culminating point but if in the midst of the exist excitement the union shall perish the evil may then become irreparable congress can contribute much to avert by propose and recommend to the legislature of the several states the remedy for exist evil which the constitution have provide for own preservation this have be try at different critical period of history and always with eminent success be to be find in the fifth article provide for own amendment under this article amendment have be propose by third of both houses|of|congress and have be ratify by the legislature of fourth of the several state and have consequently become part of the constitution to this process the country be indebte for the clause prohibit congress from pass any law respect an establishment of religion or abridge the freedom of speech or of the press or of the right of petition to this be also indebte for the bill of right which secure the people against any abuse of power by the|federal|government such be the apprehension justly entertain by the friend of state right at that period as to have render extremely doubtful whether the constitution could have long survive without those amendment again the constitution be amend by the same process after the election of president jefferson by the|house|of|representatives in february,|1803 this amendment be render necessary to prevent a recurrence of the danger which have seriously threaten the existence of the government during the pendency of that election the article for own amendment be intend to secure the amicable adjustment of conflict constitutional question like the present which may arise between the government of the states and that of this appear from contemporaneous history in this connection shall merely call attention to a few sentence in mr. madison 's justly celebrate report in to the legislature of virginia in this ably and conclusively defend the resolution of the precede legislature against the stricture of several other state legislature these be mainly round upon the protest of the virginia legislature against the alien and sedition act as palpable and alarming infraction of the constitution in point out the peaceful and constitutional remedy and refer to none other to which the states be authorize to resort on such occasion conclude by say the legislature of the states may have make a direct representation to congress with a view to obtain a rescinding of the offensive act or may have represent to respective senators in congress wish that third thereof would propose an explanatory amendment to the constitution or third of if such have be option may by an application to congress have obtain a convention for the same object this be the very course which earnestly recommend in order to obtain an explanatory amendment of the constitution on the subject of slavery this may originate with congress or the state legislature as may be deem most advisable to attain the object the explanatory amendment may be confine to the final settlement of the true construction of the constitution on special point an express recognition of the right of property in slave in the states where now exist or may hereafter exist the duty of protect this right in all the common territories throughout territorial existence and until shall be admit as states into the union with or without slavery as constitution may prescribe a like recognition of the right of the master to have slave who have escape from state to another restore and deliver up to and of the validity of the fugitive slave law enact for this purpose together with a declaration that all state law impair or defeat this right be violation of the constitution and be consequently null and void may be object that this construction of the constitution have already be settle by the|supreme|court of the|united|state and what more ought to be require the answer be that a very large proportion of the people of the|united|state still contest the correctness of this decision and never will cease from agitation and admit binding force until clearly establish by the people of the several states in sovereign character such an explanatory amendment would be believe forever terminate the exist dissension and restore peace and harmony among the states ought not to be doubt that such an appeal to the arbitrament establish by the constitution would be receive with favor by all the states of the confederacy in any event ought to be try in a spirit of conciliation before any of these state shall separate from the union when enter upon the duty of the presidential office the aspect neither of foreign nor domestic affair be at all satisfactory be involve in dangerous complication with several nation and of territories be in a state of revolution against the government a restoration of the african slave trade have numerous and powerful advocate unlawful military expedition be countenance by many of citizen and be suffer in defiance of the effort of the government to escape from shore for the purpose of make war upon the offend people of neighboring republic with whom be at peace in addition to these and other difficulty experience a revulsion in monetary affair soon after advent to power of unexampled severity and of ruinous consequence to all the great interest of the country when take a retrospect of what be then condition and contrast this with material prosperity at the time of the late presidential election have abundant reason to return grateful thank to that merciful providence which have never forsake as a nation in all past trial relation with great|britain be of the most friendly character since the commencement of administration the dangerous question arise from the clayton and bulwer treaty and from the right of search claim by the|british|government have be amicably and honorably adjust the discordant construction of the clayton and bulwer treaty between the government which at different period of the discussion bear a threatening aspect have result in a final settlement entirely satisfactory to this government in last annual message inform congress that have not then complete treaty arrangement with the republics of honduras and nicaragua in pursuance of the understanding between the government be nevertheless confidently expect that this good work will ere long be accomplish this confident expectation have since be fulfil britannic|majesty conclude a treaty with honduras on the|28th|november,|1859 and with nicaragua on the|28th|august,|1860 relinquish the mosquito protectorate besides by the former the|bay|island be recognize as a part of the|republic|of|honduras may be observe that the stipulation of these treaty conform in every important particular to the amendment adopt by the senate of the|united|state to the treaty conclude at london on the|17th|october,|1856 between the government will be recollect that this treaty be reject by the|british|government because of objection to the just and important amendment of the senate to the article relate to ruatan and the other island in the|bay|of|honduras must be a source of sincere satisfaction to all class of fellow citizen and especially to those engage in foreign commerce that the claim on the part of great|britain forcibly to visit and search american merchant vessel on the high sea in time of peace have be abandon this be by far the most dangerous question to the peace of the country which have exist since the|war|of|1812 whilst remain open may at any moment have be precipitate into a war this be render manifest by the exasperate state of public feeling throughout entire country produce by the forcible search of american merchant vessel by british cruiser on the coast of cuba in the|spring|of|1858 the american people hail with general acclaim the order of the secretary of the navy to naval force in the|gulf|of|mexico to protect all vessel of the|united|state on the high sea from search or detention by the vessel of war of any other nation these order may have produce an immediate collision between the naval force of the country this be most fortunately prevent by an appeal to the justice of great|britain and to the law of nation as expound by own most eminent jurist the only question of any importance which still remain open be the disputed title between the government to the island of san|juan in the vicinity of washington|territory as this question be still under negotiation be not deem advisable at the present moment to make any other allusion to the subject the recent visit of the prince of wales in a private character to the people of this country have prove to be a most auspicious event in consequence can not fail to increase the kindred and kindly feeling which trust may ever actuate the government and people of both country in political and social intercourse with each other with france ancient and powerful ally relation continue to be of the most friendly character a decision have recently be make by a french judicial tribunal with the approbation of the|imperial|government which can not fail to foster the sentiment of mutual regard that have so long exist between the country under the french law no person can serve in the army of france unless be a french citizen the law of france recognize the natural right of expatriation follow as a necessary consequence that a frenchman by the fact of have become a citizen of the|united|state have change allegiance and have lose native character can not therefore be compel to serve in the french army in case should return to native country these principle be announce in by the french minister of war and in late case have be confirm by the french judiciary in these native of france have be discharge from the french army because have become american citizen to employ the language of present minister to france who have render good service on this occasion do not think french naturalize fellow citizen will hereafter experience much annoyance on this subject venture to predict that the time be not far distant when the other continental power will adopt the same wise and just policy which have do so much honor to the enlighten government|of|the|emperor in any event government be bind to protect the right of naturalize citizen everywhere to the same extent as though have draw first breath in this country can recognize no distinction between native and naturalized citizen between the great empire of russia and the|united|stat the mutual friendship and regard which have so long exist still continue to prevail and if possible to increase indeed relation with that empire be all that could desire relation with spain be now of a more complicated though less dangerous character than have be for many|years citizen have long hold and continue to hold numerous claim against the|spanish|government these have be ably urge for a|series|of|year by successive diplomatic representative at madrid but without obtain redress the|spanish|government finally agree to institute a joint commission for the adjustment of these claim and on the|5th|day|of|march,|1860 conclude a convention for this purpose with present minister at madrid under this convention what have be denominate the cuban claim amount to in which more|than|100 of fellow citizen be interested be recognize and the|spanish|government agree to pay of this amount within three|months follow the exchange of ratification the payment of the remain be to await the decision of the commissioner for or against the amistad claim but in any event the balance be to be pay to the claimant either by spain or the|united|state these term have every reason to know be highly satisfactory to the holder of the cuban claim indeed have make a formal offer authorize the|state|department to settle these claim and to deduct the amount of the amistad claim from the sum which be entitle to receive from spain this offer of course can not be accept all other claim of citizen of the|united|state against spain or the subject of the|queen|of|spain against the|united|state include the amistad claim be by this convention refer to a board of commissioner in the usual form neither the validity of the amistad claim nor of any other claim against either party with the single exception of the cuban claim be recognize by the convention indeed the|spanish|government do not insist that the validity of the amistad claim should be thus recognize notwithstanding payment have be recommend to congress by of predecessor as well as by and an appropriation for that purpose have pass the senate of the|united|state be content that should be submit to the board for examination and decision like the other claim both government be bind respectively to pay the amount award to the several claimant at such time and place as may be fix by and accord to the tenor of say award transmit this convention to the senate for constitutional action on the|3d|of|may,|1860,|and|on|the|27th|of|the|succeeding|june|they|determined that would not advise and consent to ratification these proceeding place relation with spain in an awkward and embarrassing position be more than probable that the final adjustment of these claim will devolve upon successor reiterate the recommendation contain in annual message of december,|1858 and repeat in that of december,|1859 in favor of the acquisition of cuba from spain by fair purchase firmly believe that such an acquisition would contribute essentially to the well being and prosperity of both country in all future time as well as prove the certain mean of immediately abolish the african slave trade throughout the world would not repeat this recommendation upon the present occasion if believe that the transfer of cuba to the|united|state upon condition highly favorable to spain could justly tarnish the national honor of the proud and ancient spanish monarchy surely no person ever attribute to the first napoleon a disregard of the national honor of france for transfer louisiana to the|united|states for a fair equivalent both in money and commercial advantage with the emperor of austria and the remain continental power of europe include that of the sultan relation continue to be of the most friendly character the friendly and peaceful policy pursue by toward the|empire|of|china have produce the most satisfactory result the treaty of tien tsin of the 18th june have be faithfully observe by the chinese authority the convention of the 8th november,|1858 supplementary to this treaty for the adjustment and satisfaction of the claim of citizen on china refer to in last|annual message have be already carry into effect so far as this be practicable under this convention the sum of tael equal to be stipulate to be pay in satisfaction of the claim of american citizen out of the fifth of the receipt for tonnage import and export duty on american vessel at the port of canton shanghai and fuchau and be agree that this amount shall be in full liquidation of all claim of american citizen at the various port to this date debenture for this amount to wit tael for canton for shanghai and for fuchau be deliver accord to the term of the convention by the respective chinese collector of the custom of these port to the agent select by minister to receive the same since that time the claim of citizen have be adjust by the board of commissioner appoint for that purpose under the act of march|3,|1859 and award which prove satisfactory to the claimant have be approve by minister in the aggregate amount to the sum of the claimant have already receive a large proportion of the sum award to out of the fund provide and be confidently expect that the remainder will ere long be entirely pay after the award shall have be satisfied there will remain a surplus of at the disposition of congress as this will in equity belong to would not justice require appropriation to some benevolent object in which the chinese may be specially interested minister to china in obedience to instruction have remain perfectly neutral in the war between great|britain and france and the|chinese|empire although in conjunction with the russian minister be ever ready and willing have the opportunity offer to employ good office in restore peace between the party be but an act of simple justice both to present minister and predecessor to state that have prove fully equal to the delicate try and responsible position in which have on different occasion be place the ratification of the treaty with japan conclude at yeddo on the|29th|july,|1858 be exchange at washington on the|22d may last and the treaty be proclaim on the succeed day there be good reason to expect that under protection and influence trade and intercourse with that distant and interesting people will rapidly increase the ratification of the treaty be exchange with unusual solemnity for this purpose the tycoon have accredit of most distinguished subject as envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary who be receive and treat with marked distinction and kindness both by the government and people of the|united|state there be every reason to believe that have return to native land entirely satisfied with visit and inspire by the most friendly feeling for country let ardently hope in the language of the treaty that there shall henceforward be perpetual peace and friendship between the|united|states|of|america and majesty the tycoon of japan and successor with the wise conservative and liberal government|of|the|empire|of|brazil relation continue to be of the most amicable character the exchange of the ratification of the convention with the|republic|of|new|granada sign at washington on the|10th|of|september,|1857 have be long delay from accidental cause for which neither party be censurable these ratification be duly exchange in this city on the 5th of november last thus have a controversy be amicably terminate which have become so serious at the period of inauguration as to require on the|17th|of|april,|1857 to direct minister to demand passport and return to the|united|state under this convention the government of new granada have specially acknowledge to be responsible to citizen for damage which be cause by the riot at panama on the|15th|april,|1856 these claim together with other claim of citizen which have be long urge in vain be refer for adjustment to a board of commissioner submit a copy of the convention to congress and recommend the legislation necessary to carry into effect persevere effort have be make for the adjustment of the claim of american citizen against the government|of|costa|rica and be happy to inform that these have finally prevail a convention be sign at the city of san|jose on the july last between the minister resident of the|united|state in costa|rica and the plenipotentiary of that republic refer these claim to a board of commissioner and provide for the payment of award this convention will be submit immediately to the senate for constitutional action the claim of citizen upon the|republic|of|nicaragua have not yet be provide for by treaty although diligent effort for this purpose have be make by minister resident to that republic these be still continue with a fair prospect of success relation with mexico remain in a most unsatisfactory condition in last annual message discuss extensively the subject of these relation and do not now propose to repeat at length the fact and argument then present prove conclusively that citizen reside in mexico and merchant trading thereto have suffer a series of wrong and outrage such as have never patiently bear from any other nation for these successive minister invoke the faith of treaty have in the name of country persistently demand redress and indemnification but without the slight effect indeed so confident have the mexican authority become of patient endurance that universally believe may commit these outrage upon american citizen with absolute impunity thus write minister in and express the opinion that nothing but a manifestation of the power of the government and of purpose to punish these wrong will avail afterwards in come the adoption of a new constitution for mexico the election of a president and congress under provision and the inauguration of the president within one|short|month however this president be expel from the capital by a rebellion in the army and the supreme power of the republic be assign to general zuloaga this usurper be in turn soon compel to retire and give place to general miramon under the constitution which have thus be adopt as chief justice of the supreme court become the lawful president of the republic and be for the maintenance of the constitution and authority derive from that the civil war commence and still continue to be prosecute throughout the|year|1858 the constitutional party grow strong and strong in the previous history of mexico a successful military revolution at the capital have almost universally be the signal for submission throughout the republic not so on the present occasion a majority of the citizen persistently sustain the constitutional government when this be recognize in april,|1859 by authority extend over a large majority of the|mexican|state and people include vera|cruz and all the other important seaport of the republic from that period commerce with mexico begin to revive and the constitutional government have afford all the protection in power meanwhile the government of miramon still hold sway at the capital and over the surround country and continue outrage against the few american citizen who still have the courage to remain within power to cap the climax after the battle of tacubaya in april,|1859 general|marquez order citizen of the|united|state of physician to be seize in the hospital at that place take out and shoot without crime and without trial this be do notwithstanding unfortunate countryman be at the moment engage in the holy cause of afford relief to the soldier of both party who have be wound in the battle without make any distinction between the time have arrive in opinion when this government be bind to exert power to avenge and redress the wrong of citizen and to afford protection in mexico the interposing obstacle be that the portion of the country under the sway of miramon could not be reach without pass over territory under the jurisdiction of the constitutional government under these circumstance deem duty to recommend to congress in last annual message the employment of a sufficient military force to penetrate into the interior where the|government|of|miramon be to be find with or if nee be without the consent of the|juarez|government though be not doubt that this consent could be obtain never have have a clear conviction on any subject than of the justice as well as wisdom of such a policy no other alternative be leave except the entire abandonment of fellow citizen who have go to mexico under the faith of treaty to the systematic injustice cruelty and oppression of miramon's|government besides be almost certain that the simple authority to employ this force would of have accomplish all object without strike a single blow the constitutional government would then ere this have be establish at the|city|of|mexico and would have be ready and willing to the extent of ability to do justice in addition and deem this a most important consideration european|government would have be deprive of all pretext to interfere in the territorial and domestic concern of mexico should thus have be relieve from the obligation of resisting even by force should this become necessary any attempt by these government to deprive neighboring republic of portion of territory a duty from which could not shrink without abandon the traditional and establish policy of the american people be happy to observe that firmly rely upon the justice and good faith of these government there be no present danger that such a contingency will happen have discover that recommendation would not be sustain by congress the next alternative be to accomplish in some degree if possible the same object by treaty stipulation with the constitutional government such treaty be accordingly conclude by late able and excellent minister to mexico and on the|4th|of|january|last be submit to the senate for ratification as these have not yet receive the final action of that body would be improper for to present a detailed statement of provision still may be permit to express the opinion in advance that be calculate to promote the agricultural manufacturing and commercial interest of the country and to secure just influence with an adjoin republic as to whose fortune and fate can never feel indifferent whilst at the same time provide for the payment of a considerable amount toward the satisfaction of the claim of injure fellow citizen at the period of inauguration be confront in kansas by a revolutionary government exist under what be call the topeka constitution avowed object be to subdue the territorial government by force and to inaugurate what be call the topeka government in stead to accomplish this object an extensive military organization be form and command intrust to the most violent revolutionary leader under these circumstance become imperative duty to exert the whole constitutional power of the executive to prevent the flame of civil war from again rage in kansas which in the excited state of the public mind both north|and|south may have extend into the neighboring states the hostile party in kansas have be inflame against each other by emissary both from the north and the south to a degree of malignity without parallel in history to prevent actual collision and to assist the civil magistrate in enforce the law a strong detachment of the army be station in the territory ready to aid the marshal and deputy when lawfully call upon as a posse comitatus in the execution of civil and criminal process still the trouble in kansas could not have be permanently settle without an election by the people the ballot box be the sure arbiter of dispute among freeman under this conviction every proper effort be employ to induce the hostile party to vote at the election of delegate to frame a state constitution and afterwards at the election to decide whether kansas should be a slave or free state the insurgent party refuse to vote at either lest this may be consider a recognition on part of the territorial government establish by congress a well spirit however seem soon after to prevail and the party meet face to face at the third election hold on the|first|monday|of|january,|1858 for member of the legislature and state officer under the lecompton constitution the result be the triumph of the antislavery party at the poll this decision of the ballot box prove clearly that this party be in the majority and remove the danger of civil war from that time have hear little or nothing of the topeka government and all serious danger of revolutionary trouble in kansas be then at an end the lecompton constitution which have be thus recognize at this state election by the vote of both political party in kansas be transmit to with the request that should present to congress this could not have refuse to do without violate clear and strong conviction of duty the constitution and all the proceeding which precede and follow formation be fair and regular on face then believe and experience have prove that the interest of the people of kansas would have be best consult by admission as a state into the union especially as the majority within a brief period could have amend the constitution accord to will and pleasure if fraud exist in all or any of these proceeding be not for the president but for congress to investigate and determine the question of fraud and what ought to be consequence if at the first election the majority refuse to vote can not be pretend that this refusal to exercise the elective franchise could invalidate an election fairly hold under lawful authority even if have not subsequently vote at the third election be true that the whole constitution have not be submit to the people as always desire but the precedent be numerous of the admission of states into the union without such submission would not comport with present purpose to review the proceeding of congress upon the lecompton constitution be sufficient to observe that final action have remove the last vestige of serious revolutionary trouble the desperate hand recently assemble under a notorious outlaw in the southern portion of the territory to resist the execution of the law and to plunder peaceful citizen will doubt not be speedily subdue and bring to justice have treat the lecompton constitution as a nullity and refuse to transmit to congress be not difficult to imagine whilst recall the position of the country at that moment what would have be the disastrous consequence both in and out of the territory from such a dereliction of duty on the part of the executive peace have also be restore within the|territory|of|utah which at the commencement of administration be in a state of open rebellion this be the more dangerous as the people animate by a fanatical spirit and intrench within distant mountain fastness may have make a long and formidable resistance cost what may be necessary to bring into subjection to the constitution and the law sound policy therefore as well as humanity require that this object should if possible be accomplish without the effusion of blood this could only be effect by send a military force into the territory sufficiently strong to convince the people that resistance would be hopeless and at the same time to offer a pardon for past offense on condition of immediate submission to the government this policy be pursue with eminent success and the only cause for regret be the heavy expenditure require to march a large detachment of the army to that remote region and to furnish subsistence utah be now comparatively peaceful and quiet and the military force have be withdraw except that portion of necessary to keep the indians in check and to protect the emigrant train on way to pacific possession in first annual message promise to employ good exertion in cooperation with congress to reduce the expenditure of the government within the limit of a wise and judicious economy an overflow treasury have produce habit of prodigality and extravagance which could only be gradually correct the work require both time and patience apply diligently to this task from the beginning and be aid by the able and energetic effort of the head of the different executive|department the result of labor in this good cause do not appear in the sum total of expenditure for the|first|two|year mainly in consequence of the extraordinary expenditure necessarily incur in the utah expedition and the very large amount of the contingent expense of congress during this period these greatly exceed the pay and mileage of the member for the|year|ending|june|30,|1858 whilst the pay and mileage amount to the contingent expense rise to and for the|year|ending|june|30,|1859 whilst the pay and mileage amount to the contingent expense amount to be happy however to be able to inform that during the|last|fiscal|year end june|30,|1860 the total expenditure of the government in all branch legislative executive and judicial exclusive of the public debt be reduce to the sum of this conclusively appear from the book of the treasury in the|year|ending|june|30,|1858 the total expenditure exclusive of the public debt amount to and that for the|year|ending|june|30,|1859 to whilst the book of the treasury show an actual expenditure of for the|year|ending|june|30,|1860 include for the contingent expense of congress there must be deduct from this amount the sum of with the interest upon of appropriate by for the purpose of supply the deficiency in the revenue and defray the expense of the|post office|department for the|year|ending|june|30,|1859 this sum therefore justly chargeable to the|year|1859 must be deduct from the sum of in order to ascertain the expenditure for the|year|ending|june|30,|1860 which leave a balance for the expenditure of that|year of the interest on the public debt include treasury note for the|same|fiscal|year end june|30,|1860 amount to which add to the above sum of make the aggregate of ought in justice to be observe that several of the estimate from the departments for the|year|ending|june|30,|1860 be reduce by congress below what be and still be deem compatible with the public interest allow a liberal margin of for this reduction and for other cause may be safely assert that the sum of or at the most be amply sufficient to administer the government and to pay the interest on the public debt unless contingent event should hereafter render extraordinary expenditure necessary this result have be attain in a considerable degree by the care exercise by the appropriate departments in enter into public contract have never interfere with the award of any such contract except in a single case with the|colonization|society deem advisable to cast the whole responsibility in each case on the proper head of the department with the general instruction that these contract should always be give to the low and good bidder have ever be opinion that public contract be not a legitimate source of patronage to be confer upon personal or political favorite but that in all such case a public officer be bind to act for the government as a prudent individual would act for be with great satisfaction communicate the fact that since the date of last annual message not a single slave have be import into the|united|state in violation of the law prohibit the african slave trade this statement be round upon a thorough examination and investigation of the subject indeed the spirit which prevail some time since among a portion of fellow citizen in favor of this trade seem to have entirely subside also congratulate upon the public sentiment which now exist against the crime of set on foot military expedition within the limit of the|united|state to proceed from thence and make war upon the people of unoffende states with whom be at peace in this respect a happy change have be effect since the commencement of administration surely ought to be the prayer of every christian and patriot that such expedition may never again receive countenance in country or depart from shore would be a useless repetition to do more than refer with earnest commendation to former recommendation in favor of the pacific railroad of the grant of power to the president to employ the naval force in the vicinity for the protection of the life and property of fellow citizen pass in transit over the different central|american route against sudden and lawless outbreak and depredation and also to protect american merchant vessel crew and cargo against violent and unlawful seizure and confiscation in the port of mexico and the|south|american republics when these may be in a disturbed and revolutionary condition be settled conviction that without such a power do not afford that protection to those engage in the commerce of the country which have a right to demand again recommend to congress the passage of a law in pursuance of the provision of the constitution appoint a day certain previous to the 4th march in each|year of an odd number for the election of representatives throughout all the states a similar power have already be exercise with general approbation in the appointment of the same day throughout the union for hold the election of elector for president and vice president of the|united|state attention be earnestly direct to this subject from the fact that the fifth congress terminate on the 3d march,|1859 without make the necessary appropriation for the service of the|post office|department be then force to consider the good remedy for this omission and an immediate call of the present congress be the natural resort upon inquiry however ascertain that out of the|thirty three|states|composing|the confederacy be without representatives and that consequently these states would be disfranchise by such a call these states will be in the same condition on the 4th march next of can not elect representatives accord to exist state law until different period extend from the|beginning|of|august next until the|months|of|october and november in last message give warn that in a time of sudden and alarming danger the salvation of institution may depend upon the power of the president immediately to assemble a full congress to meet the emergency be now quite evident that the financial necessity of the government will require a modification of the tariff during present session for the purpose of increase the revenue in this aspect desire to reiterate the recommendation contain in last annual message in favor of impose specific instead of ad valorem duty on all import article to which these can be properly apply from long observation and experience be convinced that specific duty be necessary both to protect the revenue and to secure to manufacturing interest that amount of incidental encouragement which unavoidably result from a revenue tariff as an abstract proposition may be admit that ad valorem duty would in theory be the most just and equal but if the experience of this and of all other commercial nation have demonstrate that such duty can not be assess and collect without great fraud upon the revenue then be the part of wisdom to resort to specific duty indeed from the very nature of an ad valorem duty this must be the result under the inevitable consequence be that foreign good will be enter at less than true value the treasury will therefore lose the duty on the difference between real and fictitious value and to this extent be defraud the temptation which ad valorem duty present to a dishonest importer be irresistible object be to pass good through the custom house at the very low valuation necessary to save from confiscation in this too often succeed in spite of the vigilance of the revenue officer hence the resort to false invoice for the purchaser and another for the custom house and to other expedient to defraud the government the honest importer produce invoice to the collector state the actual price at which purchase the article abroad not so the dishonest importer and the agent of the foreign manufacturer and here may be observe that a very large proportion of the manufacture import from abroad be consign for sale to commission merchant who be mere agent employ by the manufacturer in such case no actual sale have be make to fix value the foreign manufacturer if be dishonest prepare an invoice of the good not at actual value but at the very low rate necessary to escape detection in this manner the dishonest importer and the foreign manufacturer enjoy a decided advantage over the honest merchant be thus enable to undersell the fair trader and drive from the market in fact the operation of this system have already drive from the pursuit of honorable commerce many of that class of regular and conscientious merchant whose character throughout the world be the pride of country the remedy for these evil be to be find in specific duty so far as this may be practicable dispense with any inquiry at the custom house into the actual cost or value of the article and pay the precise amount of duty previously fix by law present no temptation to the appraiser of foreign good who receive but small salary and may by undervaluation in a few case render independent besides specific duty best conform to the requisition in the constitution that no preference shall be give by any regulation of commerce or revenue to the port of state over those of another under ad valorem system such preference be to some extent inevitable and complaint have often be make that the spirit of this provision have be violate by a low appraisement of the same article at port than at another an impression strangely enough prevail to some extent that specific duty be necessarily protective duty nothing can be more fallacious glory in free trade and yet whole revenue from import be at the present moment collect under a system of specific duty be a striking fact in this connection that in the commercial treaty of january|23,|1860 between france and england of the article provide that the ad valorem duty which impose shall be convert into specific duty within six|month from date and these be to be ascertain by make an average of the price for six|month previous to that time the reverse of the proposition would be near to the truth because a much large amount of revenue would be collect by merely convert the ad valorem duty of a tariff into equivalent specific duty to this extent the revenue would be increase and in the same proportion the specific duty may be diminish specific duty would secure to the american manufacturer the incidental protection to which be fairly entitle under a revenue tariff and to this surely no person would object the framer of the exist tariff have go further and in a liberal spirit have discriminate in favor of large and useful branch of manufacture not by raise the rate of duty upon the importation of similar article from abroad but what be the same in effect by admit article free of duty which enter into the composition of fabric under the present system have be often truly remark that this incidental protection decrease when the manufacturer need most and increase when need least and constitute a slide scale which always operate against the revenue of the country be subject to similar fluctuation instead of approach a steady standard as would be the case under a system of specific duty sink and rise with the sinking and rise price of article in foreign country would not be difficult for congress to arrange a system of specific duty which would afford additional stability both to revenue and manufacture and without injury or injustice to any interest of the country this may be accomplish by ascertain the average value of any give article for a|series|of|year at the place of exportation and by simply convert the rate of ad valorem duty upon which may be deem necessary for revenue purpose into the form of a specific duty such an arrangement could not injure the consumer if should pay a great amount of duty one|year this would be counterbalance by a less amount the next and in the end the aggregate would be the same desire to call immediate attention to the present condition of the treasury so ably and clearly present by the secretary in report to congress and to recommend that measure be promptly adopt to enable to discharge press obligation the other recommendation of the report be well worthy of favorable consideration herewith transmit to congress the report of of the navy of the interior and of the|postmaster general the recommendation and suggestion which contain be highly valuable and deserve careful attention the report of the postmaster general detail the circumstance under which cornelius|vanderbilt on request agree in the|month|of|july|last to carry the ocean mail between atlantic and pacific coast have not thus act this important intercommunication must have be suspend at least for a season general have no power to make any other compensation than the postage on the mail matter which may carry be know at the time that these postage would fall far short of an adequate compensation as well as of the sum which the same service have previously cost the government mr. vanderbilt in a commendable spirit be willing to rely upon the justice of congress to make up the deficiency and therefore recommend that an appropriation may be grant for this purpose should do great injustice to the attorney general be to omit the mention of distinguished service in the measure adopt and prosecute by for the defense of the government against numerous and unfounded claim to land in california purport to have be make by the|mexican|government previous to the treaty of cession the successful opposition to these claim have save the united|states public property worth many millions|of|dollar and to individual hold title under to at least an equal amount have be represent to from source which deem reliable that the inhabitant in several portion of kansas have be reduce nearly to a state of starvation on account of the almost total failure of crop whilst the harvest in every other portion of the country have be abundant the prospect before for the approach winter be well calculated to enlist the sympathy of every heart the destitution appear to be so general that can not be relieve by private contribution and be in such indigent circumstance as to be unable to purchase the necessary of life for refer the subject to congress if any constitutional measure for relief can be devise would recommend adoption cordially commend to favorable regard the interest of the people of this district be eminently entitle to consideration especially since unlike the people of the states can appeal to no government except that of the union transcript in message to the|house|of|representatives of the 28th march last solemnly protest against the creation of a committee at the head of which be place accuser for the purpose of investigate whether the president have by money patronage or other improper mean seek to influence the action of congress or any committee thereof for or against the passage of any law appertain to the right of any state or territory protest against this because be destitute of any specification because refer to no particular act to enable the president to prepare for defense because deprive of the constitutional guard which in common with every citizen of the|united|state possess for protection and because assail constitutional independence as a coordinate branch of the government there be an enlightened justice as well as a beautiful symmetry in every part of the constitution this be conspicuously manifest in regard to impeachment the|house|of|representative possesse the sole power of impeachment the senate the sole power to try all impeachment and the impeachable offense be treason bribery or other high crime or misdemeanor the practice of the house from the early time have be in accordance with own dignity the right of the accuse and the demand of justice at the commencement of each judicial investigation which may lead to an impeachment specific charge be always prefer the accuse have an opportunity of cross - examine the witness and be place in full possession of the precise nature of the offense which have to meet an impartial and elevated stand committee be charge with this investigation upon which no member inspire with the ancient sense of honor and justice would have serve have ever express an opinion against the accuse until the present occasion be never deem proper to transform the accuser into the judge and to confer upon the selection of own committee the charge make against in vague and general term be of such a false and atrocious character that do not entertain a moment 's apprehension for the result be abhorrent to every principle instill into from youth and every practice of life and do not believe possible that the man exist who would so basely perjure as to swear to the truth of any such accusation in this conviction be inform have not be mistake in former protest therefore truly and emphatically declare that be make for no reason personal to but because the proceeding of the house be in violation of the right of the coordinate executive branch of the government subversive of constitutional independence and if unresisted would establish a precedent dangerous and embarrassing to all successor notwithstanding all this if the committee have not transcend the authority confer upon by the resolution of the|house|of|representatives broad and general as this be should have remain silent upon the subject what now charge be that have act as though possess unlimited power and without any warrant whatever in the resolution under which be appoint have pursue a course not merely at war with the constitutional right of the executive but tend to degrade the presidential office to such a degree as to render unworthy of the acceptance of any man of honor or principle the resolution of the house so far as be accusatory of the president be confine to an inquiry whether have use corrupt or improper mean to influence the action of congress or any of committee on legislative measure pende before nothing more nothing less have not learn through the newspaper or in any other mode that the committee have touch the other accusatory branch of the resolution charge the president with a violation of duty in fail to execute some law or law this branch of the resolution be therefore out of the question by what authority then have the committee undertake to investigate the course of the president in regard to the convention which frame the lecompton constitution by what authority have undertake to pry into foreign relation for the purpose of assail on account of the instruction give by the secretary of state to minister in mexico relative to the tehuantepec route by what authority have inquire into the cause of removal from office and this from the party remove with a view to prejudice character notwithstanding this power of removal belong exclusively to the president under the constitution be so decide by the|first|congress in the|year|1789 and have accordingly ever since be exercise there be in the resolution no pretext of authority for the committee to investigate the question of the printing of the post - office blank nor be to be suppose that the house if ask would have grant such an authority because this question have be previously commit to other committee in the senate and the other in the house notwithstanding this absolute want of power the committee rush into this investigation in advance of all other subject the committee proceed for month from march|22,|1860 to examine parte and without any notice to into every subject which could possibly affect character interested and vindictive witness be summon and examine before and the first and only information of testimony which in almost every instance receive be obtain from the publication of such portion of as could injuriously affect in the new|york journal matter not that these statement be so far as have learn disprove by the most respectable witness who happen to be on the spot the telegraph be silent respect these contradiction be a secret committee in regard to the testimony in defense but be public in regard to all the testimony which could by possibility reflect on character the poison be leave to produce effect upon the public mind whilst the antidote be carefully withhold in examination the committee violate the most sacred and honorable confidence exist among man private correspondence which a truly honorable man would never even entertain a distant thought of divulging be drag to light different person in official and confidential relation with and with whom be suppose may have hold conversation the revelation of which would do injury be examine even member of the senate and member of own cabinet both constitutional adviser be call upon to testify for the purpose of discover something if possible to discredit the distribution of the patronage of the government be by far the most disagreeable duty of the president applicant be so numerous and application be press with such eagerness by friend both in and out of congress that the selection of for any desirable office give offense to many disappointed applicant remove officer and those who for any cause real or imaginary have become hostile to the administration present or be invite by a summon to appear before the committee these be the most dangerous witness even with the good intention be so influence by prejudice and disappointment that almost inevitably discolor truth swear to own version of private conversation with the president without the possibility of contradiction lip be seal and be leave at mercy can not as a coordinate branch of the government appear before a committee of investigation to contradict the oath of such witness every coward know that can employ insult language against the president with impunity and every false or prejudiced witness can attempt to swear away character before such a committee without the fear of contradiction thus for month whilst do good at end of the avenue to perform high and responsible duty to the country have there be a committee of the|house|of|representatives in session at the other end of the avenue spread a drag net without the shadow of authority from the house over the whole union to catch any disappointed man willing to malign character and all this in secret conclave the lion 's mouth at venice into which secret denunciation be drop be an apt illustration of the covode committee the star chamber tyrannical and odious as be never proceed in such a manner for century there have be nothing like in any civilized country except the revolutionary tribunal of france in the|day of robespierre now undertake to state and to prove that should the proceeding of the committee be sanction by the house and become a precedent for future time the balance of the constitution will be entirely upset and there will no longer remain the coordinate and independent branch of the government legislative executive and judicial the bad fear of the patriot and statesman who frame the constitution in regard to the usurpation of the legislative on the executive and judicial branch will then be realize in the language of mr. madison speak on this very subject in the eighth number of the federalist in a representative republic where the executive magistracy be carefully limited both in the extent and duration of power and where the legislative power be exercise by an assembly which be inspire by a suppose influence over the people with an intrepid confidence in own strength which be sufficiently numerous to feel all the passion which actuate a multitude yet not so numerous as to be incapable of pursue the object of passion by mean which reason prescribe be against the enterprise ambition of this department that the people ought to indulge all jealousy and exhaust all precaution and in the expressive and pointed language of mr. jefferson when speak of the tendency of the legislative branch of government to usurp the right of the weak branch the concentrating these in the same hand be precisely the definition of despotic government will be no alleviation that these power will be exercise by a plurality of hand and not by a single despot would surely be as oppressive as let those who doubt turn eye on as little will avail that be choose by an elective despotism be not the government fight for but one which should not only be round on free principle but in which the power of government should be so divided and balance among several body of magistracy as that no one could transcend legal limit without be effectually check and control by the other should the proceeding of the covode committee become a precedent both the letter and spirit of the constitution will be violate of the massive column on which the whole superstructure rest will be break down instead of the executive be a coordinate will become a subordinate branch of the government the presidential office will be drag into the dust the|house|of|representative will then have render the executive almost necessarily subservient to wish instead of be independent how be possible that power in the state can be coordinate and independent of each other if the one claim and exercise the power to reprove and to censure all the official act and all the private conversation of the other and this upon parte testimony before a secret inquisitorial committee in short to assume a general censorship over the other the idea be as absurd in public as would be in private life should the president attempt to assert and maintain own independence future covode committee may dragoon into submission by collect the host of disappointed office hunter remove officer and those who desire to live upon the public treasury which must follow in the wake of every administration and in secret conclave will swear away reputation under such circumstance must be a very bold man should not surrender at discretion and consent to exercise authority accord to the will of those invest with this terrific power the sovereign people of the several states have elect to the high and most honorable office in the world be only direct representative in the government by constitution have make commander in chief of army and navy represent in intercourse with foreign nation clothe with dignity and authority occupy a proud position before all nation civilized and savage with the consent of the senate appoint all the important officer of the government exercise the veto power and to that extent control the legislation of congress for the performance of these high duty be responsible to the people of the several states and not in any degree to the|house|of|representatives shall surrender these high power confer upon as the representative of the american people for benefit to the house to be exercise under overshadow influence and control shall alone of all the citizen of the|united|state be deny a fair trial shall alone not be inform of the nature and cause of the accusation against shall alone not be confront with the witness against shall the|house|of|representatives usurp the power of the senate proceed to try the president through the agency of a secret committee of the body where be impossible can make any defense and then without afford an opportunity of be hear pronounce a judgment of censure against the very same rule may be apply for the very same reason to every judge of every court of the|united|state from what part of the constitution be this terrible secret inquisitorial power derive no such express power exist from which of the enumerate power can be infer be true the house can not pronounce the formal judgment against of removal from office but can by judgment of censure asperse reputation and thus to the extent of influence render the office contemptible an example be at hand of the reckless manner in which this power of censure can be employ in high party time the house on a recent occasion have attempt to degrade the president by adopt the resolution of mr. john|sherman declare that in conjunction with the secretary of the navy by receive and consider the party relation of bidder for contract and the effect of award contract upon pende election have set an example dangerous to the public safety and deserve the reproof of this house will scarcely be credit that the sole pretext for this vote of censure be the simple fact that in dispose of the numerous letter of every imaginable character which daily receive have in the usual course of business refer a letter from colonel patterson of philadelphia in relation to a contract to the attention of the secretary of the navy the head of the appropriate department without express or intimate any opinion whatever on the subject and to make the matter if possible still plainer the secretary have inform the committee that the president do not in any manner interfere in this case nor have in any other case of contract since have be in the department the absence of all proof to sustain this attempt to degrade the president whilst manifest the venom of the shaft aim at have destroy the vigor of the bow to return after this digression should the house by the institution of covode committee vote of censure and other device to harass the president reduce to subservience to will and render creature then the well balance government which father frame will be annihilate this conflict have already be commence in earnest by the house against the executive a bad precedent rarely if ever die will fear be pursue in the time of successor no matter what may be political character should secret committee be appoint with unlimited authority to range over all the word and action and if possible the very thought of the president with a view to discover something in past life prejudicial to character from parasite and informer this would be an ordeal which scarcely any mere man since the fall could endure would be to subject to a reign of terror from which the stout and purest heart may shrink have pass triumphantly through this ordeal vindication be complete the committee have report no resolution look to an impeachment against no resolution of censure not even a resolution point out any abuse in any of the|executive|departments|of|the|government to be correct by legislation this be the high commendation which could be bestow on the head of these departments the sovereign people of the states will however trust save successor whoever may be from any such ordeal be frank bold and honest det delator and informer therefore in the name and as the representative of this great people and stand upon the rampart of the constitution which have ordain and establish do solemnly protest against these unprecedented and unconstitutional proceeding there be still another committee raise by the house on the|6th|march|last on motion of mr. hoard to which have not the slight objection the resolution create be confine to specific charge which have ever since be ready and willing to meet have at all time invite and defy fair investigation upon constitutional principle have receive no notice that this committee have ever proceed to the investigation why should the|house|of|representatives desire to encroach on the other department of the government rightful power be ample for every legitimate purpose be the impeaching body in legislative capacity be most wise and wholesome prerogative to institute rigid examination into the manner in which all department of the government be conduct with a view to reform abuse to promote economy and to improve every branch of administration should find reason to believe in the course of examination that any grave offense have be commit by the president or any officer of the government render proper in judgment to resort to impeachment course would be plain would then transfer the question from legislative to accusatory jurisdiction and take care that in all the preliminary judicial proceeding preparatory to the vote of article of impeachment the accuse should enjoy the benefit of cross - examine the witness and all the other safeguard with which the constitution surround every american citizen if in a legislative investigation should appear that the public interest require the removal of any officer of the government no president have ever exist who after give a fair hearing would hesitate to apply the remedy this take to be the ancient and well establish practice an adherence to will best promote the harmony and the dignity of the intercourse between the coordinate branch of the government and render all more respectable both in the eye of own countryman and of foreign nation transcript on the|26th|day|of|april last lieutenant craven of the|united|state steamer mohawk capture the slaver wildfire on the coast of cuba with african negro on board the prize be bring into key|west on the|31st|april and the negro be deliver into the custody of fernando|j.|moreno marshal of the southern district of florida the question which now demand immediate decision be what disposition shall be make of these africans in the annual message to congress of december|6,|1858 express opinion in regard to the construction of the act of the march,|1819 in addition to the act prohibit the slave trade so far as the same be applicable to the present case from this make the following extract under the second section of this act the president be authorize to make such regulation and arrangement as may deem expedient for the safe keeping support and removal beyond the limit of the|united|state of all such negro mulatto or person of color capture by vessel of the|united|state as may be deliver to the marshal of the district into which be bring and to appoint a proper person or person reside upon the coast of africa as agent or agent for receive the negro mulatto or person of color deliver from on board vessel seize in the prosecution of the slave trade by commander of united|states armed vessel a doubt immediately arise as to the true construction of this act be quite clear from term that the president be authorize to provide for the safe keeping support and removal of these negro up till the time of delivery to the agent on the coast of africa but no express provision be make for protection and support after have reach the place of destination still an agent be to be appoint to receive in africa and could not have be suppose that congress intend should desert at the moment be receive and turn loose on that inhospitable coast to perish for want of food or to become again the victim of the slave trade have this be the intention of congress the employment of an agent to receive who be require to reside on the coast be unnecessary and may have be land by vessel anywhere in africa and leave expose to the suffering and the fate which would certainly await mr. monroe in special message of december|17,|1819 at the first session after the act be pass announce to congress what in opinion be true construction believe to be duty under to follow these unfortunate into africa and make provision for there until should be able to provide for in communicate this interpretation of the act to congress state that some doubt have be entertain as to true intent and meaning and submit the question to so that may should be deem advisable amend the same before further proceeding be have under nothing be do by congress to explain the act and mr. monroe proceed to carry into execution accord to own interpretation this then become the practical construction adopt this construction of president monroe enter into an agreement with the|colonization|society date 7th september to receive the africans which have be capture on the slaver echo from the agent of the|united|state in liberia to furnish during the period of one|year thereafter with comfortable shelter clothing and provision and to cause to be instruct in the art of civilized life suitable to condition at the rate of for each individual be believe that within that period would be prepared to become citizen of liberia and to take care of as congress be not then in session and as there be no outstanding appropriation applicable to this purpose the society be oblige to depend for payment on the future action of that body recommend this appropriation and be grant by the act of march,|1859 the consular and diplomatic bill to enable the president of the|united|state to carry into effect the act of congress of march,|1819 and any subsequent act now in force for the suppression of the slave trade of this appropriation there remain unexpende the sum of after deduct from an advance make by the secretary of the interior out of the judiciary fund of regret to say that under the mode adopt in regard to the africans capture on board the echo the expense will be large but this seem to a great extent to be inevitable without a violation of the law of humanity the expenditure upon this scale for those capture on board the wildfire will not be and may considerably exceed that sum still ought to be observe that during the period when the government through own agent undertake the task of provide for capture negro in africa the cost per head be much great than that which agree to pay the|colonization|society but will not be sufficient for congress to limit the amount appropriate to the case of the wildfire be probable judge from the increase activity of the slave trade and the vigilance of cruiser that several similar capture may be make before the|end|of|the|year an appropriation ought therefore to be grant large enough to cover such contingency the period have arrive when be indispensable to provide some specific legislation for the guidance of the executive on this subject with this view would suggest that congress may authorize the president to enter into a general agreement with the|colonization|society bind to receive on the coast of africa from an agent there all the capture africans which may be deliver to and to maintain for a limited period upon such term and condition as may combine humanity toward these unfortunate with a just economy this would obviate the necessity of make a new bargain with every new capture and would prevent delay and avoid expense in the disposition of the capture the law may then provide that in all case where this may be practicable the captor should carry the negro directly to africa and deliver to the american agent there afterwards bring the capture vessel to the|united|states for adjudication the capture officer in case should bring prize directly to the|united|state ought to be require to land the negro in some or more port to be designate by congress where the prevail health throughout the|year be good at these port cheap but permanent accommodation may be provide for the negro until could be send away without incur the expense of erect such accommodation at every port where the capture officer may think proper to enter on the present occasion these negro have be bring to key|west and accord to the estimate present by the marshal of the southern district of florida to the secretary of the interior the cost of provide temporary quarter for will be and the aggregate expense for the|single|month|of|may will amount to but this be far from be the bad evil within a|few|week the yellow fever will most probably prevail at key|west and hence the marshal urge removal from their|present|quarters at an|early|day which must be do in any event as soon as practicable for these reason earnestly commend this subject to the immediate attention of congress transmit herewith a copy of the letter and estimate of fernando|j.|moreno marshal of the southern district of florida to the secretary of the interior date together with a copy of the letter of the secretary of the interior to date 16th may be truly lamentable that great|britain and the|united|states should be oblige to expend such a vast amount of blood and treasure for the suppression of the african slave trade and this when the only portion of the civilized world where be tolerate and encourage be the spanish island of cuba and porto|rico transcript after a delay which have afford ample time for reflection and after much and careful deliberation find constrain by an imperious sense of duty as a coordinate branch of the|federal|government to protest against the first clause of the first resolution adopt by the|house|of|representatives on the 5th instant and publish in the|congressional|globe on the succeed day these clause be in the following word resolve that a committee of member be appoint by the speaker for the purpose first of investigate whether the president of the|united|state or any other officer of the government have by money patronage or other improper mean seek to influence the action of congress or any committee thereof for or against the passage of any law appertain to the right of any state or territory and second also to inquire into and investigate whether any officer or officer of the government have by combination or otherwise prevent or defeat or attempt to prevent or defeat the execution of any law or law now upon the statute book and whether the president have fail or refuse to compel the execution of any law thereof confine exclusively to these branch of the resolution because the portion of which follow relate to allege abuse in post - office navy yard public building and other public work of the|united|state in such case inquiry be highly proper in and belong equally to the senate and the house as incident to legislative duty and be necessary to enable to discover and to provide the appropriate legislative remedy for any abuse which may be ascertain although the term of the latter portion of the resolution be extremely vague and general yet sole purpose in advert to at present be to mark the broad line of distinction between the accusatory and the remedial clause of this resolution the|house|of|representative possess no power under the constitution over the first or accusatory portion of the resolution except as an impeaching body whilst over the last in common with the senate authority as a legislative body be fully and cheerfully admit be solely in reference to the first or impeaching power that propose to make a few observation except in this single case the constitution have invest the|house|of|representatives with no power no jurisdiction no supremacy whatever over the president in all other respect be quite as independent of as be of as a coordinate branch of the government be equal indeed be the only direct representative on earth of the people of all and each of the sovereign states to and to alone be responsible whilst act within the sphere of constitutional duty and not in any manner to the people have think proper to invest with the most honorable responsible and dignified office in the world and the individual however unworthy now hold this exalt position will take care so far as in lie that right and prerogative shall never be violate in person but shall pass to successor unimpaire by the adoption of a dangerous precedent will defend to the last extremity against any unconstitutional attempt come from what|quarter may to abridge the constitutional right of the executive and render subservient to any human power except the people have not confine the president to the exercise of executive duty have also confer upon a large measure of legislative discretion no bill can become a law without approval as represent the people of the|united|state unless shall pass after veto by a majority of third of both houses in legislative capacity may in common with the senate and the house institute an inquiry to ascertain any fact which ought to influence judgment in approve or veto any bill this participation in the performance of legislative duty between the coordinate branch of the government ought to inspire the conduct of all of in relation toward each other with mutual forbearance and respect at least each have a right to demand justice from the other the cause of complaint be that the constitutional right and immunity of the executive have be violate in the person of the president the trial of an impeachment of the president before the senate on charge prefer and prosecute against by the|house|of|representatives would be an imposing spectacle for the world in the result not only removal from the presidential office would be involve but what be of infinitely great importance to character both in the eye of the present and of future generation may possibly be tarnish the disgrace cast upon would in some degree be reflect upon the character of the american people who elect hence the precaution adopt by the constitution to secure a fair trial on such a trial declare that the chief justice shall preside this be doubtless because the framer of the constitution believe to be possible that the vice president may be bias by the fact that in case of the removal of the president from office the same shall devolve on the vice president the preliminary proceeding in the house in the case of charge which may involve impeachment have be well and wisely settle by long practice upon principle of equal justice both to the accuse and to the people the precedent establish in the case of judge peck of missouri in after a careful review of all former precedent will venture to predict stand the test of time in that case luke|edward|lawless the accuser present a petition to the house in which set forth minutely and specifically cause of complaint pray that the conduct and proceeding in this behalf of say judge peck may be inquire into by honorable body and such decision make thereon as to wisdom and justice shall seem proper this petition be refer to the|judiciary|committee such have ever be deem the appropriate committee to make similar investigation be a stand committee suppose to be appoint without reference to any special case and at all time be presume to be compose of the most eminent lawyer in the house from different portion of the union whose acquaintance with judicial proceeding and whose habit of investigation qualify peculiarly for the task no tribunal from position and character could in the nature of thing be more impartial in the case of judge peck the witness be select by the committee with a view to ascertain the truth of the charge be cross - examine by and everything be conduct in such a manner as to afford no reasonable cause of complaint in view of this precedent and what be of far great importance in view of the constitution and the principle of eternal justice in what manner have the president of the|united|state be treat by the|house|of|representatives mr. john|covode a representative from pennsylvania be the accuser of the president instead of follow the wise precedent of former time and especially that in the case of judge peck and refer the accusation to the|committee|on|the|judiciary the house have make accuser of judge to make the accuser the judge be a violation of the principle of universal justice and be condemn by the practice of all civilized nation every freeman must revolt at such a spectacle be to appear before mr. covode either personally or by a substitute to cross - examine the witness which may produce before to sustain own accusation against and perhaps even this poor boon may be deny to the president and what be the nature of the investigation which resolution propose to institute be as vague and general as the english language afford word in which to make the committee be to inquire not into any specific charge or charge but whether the president have by money patronage or other improper mean seek to influence not the action of any individual member or member of congress but the action of the entire body of congress or any committee thereof the president may have have some glimmering of the nature of the offense to be investigate have accuser point to the act or act of congress which seek to pass or to defeat by the employment of money patronage or other improper mean but the accusation be bound by no such limit extend to the whole circle of legislation to interference for or against the passage of any law appertain to the right of any state or territory and what law do not appertain to the right of some state or territory and what law or law have the president fail to execute these may easily have be point out have any such exist have mr. lawless ask an inquiry to be make by the house whether judge peck in general term have not violate judicial duty without the specification of any particular act do not believe there would have be a single vote in that body in favor of the inquiry since the time of the star chamber and of general warrant there have be no such proceeding in england the|house|of|representatif the high impeaching power of the country without consent to hear a word of explanation have indorse this accusation against the president and make own act even refuse to permit a member to inquire of the president 's accuser what be the specific charge against thus in this preliminary accusation of high crime and misdemeanor against a coordinate branch of the government under the impeaching power the house refuse to hear a single suggestion even in regard to the correct mode of proceeding but without a moment 's delay pass the accusatory resolution under the pressure of the previous question in the institution of a prosecution for any offense against the most humble citizen and claim for no great right than enjoy the constitution of the|united|state and of the several states require that shall be inform in the very beginning of the nature and cause of the accusation against in order to enable to prepare for defense there be other principle which may enumerate not less sacred present an impenetrable shield to protect every citizen falsely charge with a criminal offense these have be violate in the prosecution institute by the|house|of|representatives against the executive branch of the government shall the president alone be deprive of the protection of these great principle which prevail in every land where a ray of liberty penetrate the gloom of despotism shall the executive alone be deprive of right which all fellow citizen enjoy the whole proceeding against justify the fear of those wise and great man who before the constitution be adopt by the states apprehend that the tendency of the government be to the aggrandizement of the legislative at the expense of the executive and judicial department again declare emphatically that make this protest for no reason personal to and do with perfect respect for the|house|of|representatives in which have the honor of serve as a member for successive term have live long in this goodly land and have enjoy all the office and honor which country could bestow amid all the political storm through which have pass the present be the first attempt which have ever be make to knowledge to assail personal or official integrity and this as the time be approach when shall voluntarily retire from the service of country feel proudly conscious that there be no public act of life which will not bear the strict scrutiny defy all investigation nothing but the base perjury can sully good name do not fear even this because cherish an humble confidence that the gracious being who have hitherto defend and protect against the shaft of falsehood and malice will not desert now when have become old and gray head can declare before god and country that no human being with an exception scarcely worthy of notice have at any period of life dare to approach with a corrupt or dishonorable proposition and until recent development have never enter into imagination that any person even in the storm of exasperate political excitement would charge in the most remote degree with have make such a proposition to any human being may now however exclaim in the language of complaint employ by first and great predecessor that have be abuse in such exaggerated and indecent term as could scarcely be apply to a nero to a notorious defaulter or even to a common pickpocket do therefore for the reason state and in the name of the people of the several states solemnly protest against these proceeding of the|house|of|representatives because be in violation of the right of the coordinate executive branch of the government and subversive of constitutional independence because be calculate to foster a band of interested parasite and informer ever ready for own advantage to swear before parte committee to pretend private conversation between the president and incapable from nature of be disprove thus furnish material for harass degrade in the eye of the country and eventually should be a weak or a timid man render subservient to improper influence in order to avoid such persecution and annoyance because tend to destroy that harmonious action for the common good which ought to be maintain and which sincerely desire to cherish between coordinate branch of the government and finally because if unresisted would establish a precedent dangerous and embarrassing to all successor to whatever political party may be attach transcript mr president and fellow citizens|of|new york the fact with which shall deal this|evening be mainly old and familiar nor be there anything new in the general use shall make of if there shall be any novelty will be in the mode of present the fact and the inference and observation follow that presentation in speech last|autumn at columbus ohio as report in the|new|york|times senator douglas say transcript fellow citizens of the senate and house|of|representatif deep and heartfelt gratitude be due to that almighty|power which have bestow upon such varied and numerous blessing throughout the|past|year the general health of the country have be excellent harvest have be unusually plentiful and prosperity smile throughout the land indeed notwithstanding demerit have much reason to believe from the past event in history that have enjoy the special protection of divine|providence ever since origin as a nation have be expose to many threatening and alarming difficulty in progress but on each successive occasion the impending cloud have be dissipate at the moment appear ready to burst upon head and the danger to institution have pass away may ever be under the divine guidance and protection whilst be the duty of the president from time to time to give to congress information of the state of the union shall not refer in detail to the recent sad and bloody occurrence at harpers|ferry still be proper to observe that these event however bad and cruel in derive chief importance from the apprehension that be but symptom of an incurable disease in the public mind which may break out in still more dangerous outrage and terminate at last in an open war by the north to abolish slavery in the south whilst for entertain no such apprehension ought to afford a solemn warning to all to beware of the approach of danger our|union be a stake of such inestimable value as to demand constant and watchful vigilance for preservation in this view let implore countryman north|and|south to cultivate the ancient feeling of mutual forbearance and good will toward each other and strive to allay the demon spirit of sectional hatred and strife now alive in the land this advice proceed from the heart of an old public functionary whose service commence in the last generation among the wise and conservative statesman of that|day now nearly all pass away and whose first and dear earthly wish be to leave country tranquil prosperous united and powerful ought to reflect that in this|age and especially in this country there be an incessant flux and reflux of public opinion question which in their|day assume a most threatening aspect have now nearly go from the memory of man be volcano burn out and on the lava and ashe and squalid scoria of old eruption grow the peaceful olive the cheer vine and the sustain corn such in opinion will prove to be the fate of the present sectional excitement should those who wisely seek to apply the remedy continue always to confine effort within the pale of the constitution if this course be pursue the exist agitation on the subject of domestic slavery like everything human will have and give place to other and less threatening controversy public opinion in this country be all powerful and when reach a dangerous excess upon any question the good sense of the people will furnish the corrective and bring back within safe limit still to hasten this auspicious result at the present crisis ought to remember that every rational creature must be presume to intend the natural consequence of own teaching those who announce abstract doctrine subversive of the constitution and the union must not be surprised should heated partisan advance step further and attempt by violence to carry these doctrine into practical effect in this view of the subject ought never to be forget that however great may have be the political advantage result from the union to every portion of common country these would all prove to be as nothing should the time ever arrive when can not be enjoy without serious danger to the personal safety of the people of member of the confederacy if the peace of the domestic fireside throughout these state should ever be invade if the mother of family within this extensive region should not be able to retire to rest at night without suffer dreadful apprehension of what may be own fate and that of child before the|morn would be vain to recount to such a people the political benefit which result to from the union self preservation be the first instinct of nature and therefore any state of society in which the sword be all the time suspend over the head of the people must at last become intolerable but indulge in no such gloomy foreboding on the contrary firmly believe that the event at harpers|ferry by cause the people to pause and reflect upon the possible peril to cherish institution will be the mean under providence of allay the exist excitement and prevent further outbreak of a similar character will resolve that the constitution and the union shall not be endanger by rash counsel know that should the silver cord be loose or the golden bowl be break at the fountain human power could never reunite the scatter and hostile fragment cordially congratulate upon the final settlement by the|supreme|court of the|united|state of the question of slavery in the territories which have present an aspect so truly formidable at the commencement of administration the right have be establish of every citizen to take property of any kind include slave into the common territories belong equally to all the states of the confederacy and to have protect there under the|federal|constitution neither congress nor a territorial legislature nor any human power have any authority to annul or impair this vested right the supreme judicial tribunal of the country which be a coordinate branch of the government have sanction and affirm these principle of constitutional law so manifestly just in and so well calculated to promote peace and harmony among the states be a striking proof of the sense of justice which be inherent in people that the property in slave have never be disturb to knowledge in any of the territories even throughout the late trouble in kansas there have not be any attempt as be credibly inform to interfere in a single instance with the right of the master have any such attempt be make the judiciary would doubtless have afford an adequate remedy should fail to do this hereafter will then be time enough to strengthen hand by further legislation have be decide that either congress or the territorial legislature possess the power to annul or impair the right to property in slave the evil would be intolerable in the latter event there would be a struggle for a majority of the member of the legislature at each successive election and the sacred right of property hold under the|federal|constitution would depend for the time be on the result the agitation would thus be render incessant whilst the territorial condition remain and baneful influence would keep alive a dangerous excitement among the people of the several states thus have the status of a territory during the intermediate period from first settlement until shall become a state be irrevocably fix by the final decision of the|supreme|court fortunate have this be for the prosperity of the territories as well as the tranquillity of the states now emigrant from the north and the south the east and the west will meet in the territories on a common platform have bring with that specie of property best adapt in own opinion to promote welfare from natural cause the slavery question will in each case soon virtually settle and before the territory be prepare for admission as a state into the union this decision way or the other will have be a foregone conclusion meanwhile the settlement of the new territory will proceed without serious interruption and progress and prosperity will not be endanger or retard by violent political struggle when in the progress of event the inhabitant of any territory shall have reach the number require to form a state will then proceed in a regular manner and in the exercise of the right of popular sovereignty to form a constitution preparatory to admission into the union after this have be do to employ the language of the kansas and nebraska act shall be receive into the union with or without slavery as constitution may prescribe at the time of admission this sound principle have happily be recognize in some form or other by an almost unanimous vote of both house of the last congress all lawful mean at command have be employ and shall continue to be employ to execute the law against the african slave trade after a most careful and rigorous examination of coast and a thorough investigation of the subject have not be able to discover that any slave have be import into the|united|state except the cargo by the wanderer number between three|and|four|hundred those engage in this unlawful enterprise have be rigorously prosecute but not with as much success as crime have deserve a number of be still under prosecution history prove that the father of the republic in advance of all other nation condemn the african slave trade be notwithstanding deem expedient by the framer of the constitution to deprive congress of the power to prohibit the migration or importation of such person as any of the states now exist shall think proper to admit prior to the|year|1808 will be see that this restriction on the power of congress be confine to such states only as may think proper to admit the importation of slave do not extend to other states or to the trade carry on abroad accordingly find that so early as the|22d|march,|1794 congress pass an act impose severe penalty and punishment upon citizen and resident of the|united|state who should engage in this trade between foreign nation the provision of this act be extend and enforce by the act of 10th may again the states have a clear right to waive the constitutional privilege intend for benefit and to prohibit by own law this trade at any time think proper previous to several of exercise this right before that period and among some contain the great number of slave this give to congress the immediate power to act in regard to all such states because have remove the constitutional barrier congress accordingly pass an act on to prevent the importation of certain person into certain states where by the law thereof admission be prohibit in this manner the importation of african slave into the|united|state be to a great extent prohibit some|years in advance of as the|year|1808 approach congress determine not to suffer this trade to exist even for a|single|day after have the power to abolish on the|2d of march,|1807 pass an act to take effect from and after the|1st|day|of|january,|1808 prohibit the importation of african slave into the|united|state this be follow by subsequent act of a similar character to which need not specially refer such be the principle and such the practice of ancestor more|than|fifty|years|ago in regard to the african slave trade do not occur to the revere patriot who have be delegate to the convention and afterwards become member of congress that in pass these law have violate the constitution which have frame with so much care and deliberation suppose that to prohibit congress in express term from exercise a specify power before an appoint day necessarily involve the right to exercise this power after that|day have arrive if this be not the case the framer of the constitution have expend much labor in vain have imagine that congress would possess no power to prohibit the trade either before or after would not have take so much care to protect the states against the exercise of this power before that period nay more would not have attach such vast importance to this provision as to have exclude from the possibility of future repeal or amendment to which other portion of the constitution be expose would then have be wholly unnecessary to ingraft on the fifth article of the constitution prescribe the mode of own future amendment the proviso that no amendment which may be make prior to the year shall in any manner affect the provision in the constitution secure to the states the right to admit the importation of african slave previous to that period accord to the adverse construction the clause on which so much care and discussion have be employ by the member of the convention be an absolute nullity from the beginning and all that have since be do under a mere usurpation be well and wise to confer this power on congress because have be leave to the states efficient exercise would have be impossible in that event any state could have effectually continue the trade not only for but for all the other slave states though never so much against will and why because african slave when once bring within the limit of any state in accordance with law can not practically be exclude from any state where slavery exist and even if all the states have separately pass law prohibit the importation of slave these law would have fail of effect for want of a naval force to capture the slaver and to guard the coast such a force no state can employ in time of peace without the consent of congress these act of congress be believe have with very rare and insignificant exception accomplish purpose for a period of more|than|half|a|century there have be no perceptible addition to the number of domestic slave during this period advancement in civilization have far surpass that of any other portion of the african race the light and the blessing of christianity have be extend to and both moral and physical condition have be greatly improve reopen the trade and would be difficult to determine whether the effect would be more deleterious on the interest of the master or on those of the native bear slave of the evil to the master the one most to be dread would be the introduction of wild heathen and ignorant barbarian among the sober orderly and quiet slave whose ancestor have be on the soil for several generation this may tend to barbarize demoralize and exasperate the whole mass and produce most deplorable consequence the effect upon the exist slave would if possible be still more deplorable at present be treat with kindness and humanity be well fed well clothe and not overwork condition be incomparably well than that of the cooly which modern nation of high civilization have employ as a substitute for african slave both the philanthropy and the self interest of the master have combine to produce this humane result but let this trade be reopen and what will be the effect the same to a considerable extent as on a neighboring island the only spot now on earth where the african slave trade be openly tolerate and this in defiance of solemn treaty with a power abundantly able at any moment to enforce execution there the master intent upon present gain extort from the slave as much labor as physical power be capable of endure know that when death come to relief place can be supply at a price reduce to the low point by the competition of rival african slave trader should this ever be the case in country which do not deem possible the present useful character of the domestic institution wherein those too old and too young to work be provide for with care and humanity and those capable of labor be not overtasked would undergo an unfortunate change the feeling of reciprocal dependence and attachment which now exist between master and slave would be convert into mutual distrust and hostility but be oblige as a christian and moral nation to consider what would be the effect upon unhappy africa if should reopen the slave trade this would give the trade an impulse and extension which have never have even in its|palmiest|days the numerous victim require to supply would convert the whole slave coast into a perfect pandemonium for which this country would be hold responsible in the eye both of god and man petty tribe would then be constantly engage in predatory war against each other for the purpose of seize slave to supply the american market all hope of african civilization would thus be end on the other hand when a market for african slave shall no longer be furnish in cuba and thus all the world be close against this trade may then indulge a reasonable hope for the gradual improvement of africa the chief motive of war among the tribe will cease whenever there be no longer any demand for slave the resource of that fertile but miserable country may then be develop by the hand of industry and afford subject for legitimate foreign and domestic commerce in this manner christianity and civilization may gradually penetrate the exist gloom the wisdom of the course pursue by this government toward china have be vindicate by the event whilst sustain a neutral position in the war wag by great|britain and france against the|chinese|empire late minister in obedience to instruction judiciously cooperate with the minister of these power in all peaceful measure to secure by treaty the just concession demand by the interest of foreign commerce the result be that satisfactory treaty have be conclude with china by the respective minister of the|united|state great|britain france and russia treaty or general convention of peace amity and commerce with that empire be conclude at tien tsin on the 18th june and be ratify by the president by and with the advice and consent of the senate on the|21st|december follow on the|15th|december,|1858 john|e.|ward a distinguished citizen of georgia be duly commission as envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to china leave the|united|state for the place of destination on the 5th of february bear with the ratified copy of this treaty and arrive at shanghai on the|28th may from thence proceed to peking on but do not arrive in that city until accord to the term of the treaty the ratification be to be exchange on or before the|18th|june,|1859 this be render impossible by reason and event beyond control not necessary to detail but still be due to the chinese authority at shanghai to state that always assure no advantage should be take of the delay and this pledge have be faithfully redeem on the arrival of mr. ward at peking request an audience of the emperor to present letter of credence this do not obtain in consequence of very proper refusal to submit to the humiliating ceremony require by the etiquette of this strange people in approach sovereign nevertheless the interview on this question be conduct in the most friendly spirit and with all due regard to personal feeling and the honor of country when a presentation to majesty be find to be impossible the letter of credence from the president be receive with peculiar honor by kweiliang the emperor 's prime minister and the second man in the empire to the emperor the ratification of the treaty be afterwards on the|16th|of|august exchange in proper form at peit sang as the exchange do not take place until after the day prescribe by the treaty be deem proper before publication again to submit to the senate be but simple justice to the chinese authority to observe that throughout the whole transaction appear to have act in good faith and in a friendly spirit toward the|united|state be true this have be do after own peculiar fashion but ought to regard with a lenient eye the ancient custom of an empire date back for thousands|of|year so far as this may be consistent with own national honor the conduct of minister on the occasion have receive entire approbation in order to carry out the spirit of this treaty and to give full effect become necessary to conclude supplemental convention the for the adjustment and satisfaction of the claim of citizen and the other to fix the tariff on import and export and to regulate the transit duty and trade of merchant with china this duty be satisfactorily perform by late minister these convention bear date at shanghai on the|8th|november,|1858 have be consider in the light of bind agreement subsidiary to the principal treaty and to be carry into execution without delay do not provide for any formal ratification or exchange of ratification by the contracting party this be not deem necessary by the chinese who be already proceed in good faith to satisfy the claim of citizen and be hope to carry out the other provision of the convention still think be proper to submit to the senate by which be ratified on the of march the ratified copy however do not reach shanghai until after the departure of minister to peking and these convention could not therefore be exchange at the same time with the principal treaty no doubt be entertain that will be ratified and exchange by should this be think advisable but under the circumstance present shall consider bind engagement from date on both party and cause to be publish as such for the information and guidance of merchant trade with the|chinese|empire afford much satisfaction to inform that all difficulty with the|republic|of|paraguay have be satisfactorily adjust happily do not become necessary to employ the force for this purpose which congress have place at command under the joint resolution of june,|1858 on the contrary the president of that republic in a friendly spirit accede promptly to the just and reasonable demand of the|government|of|the|united|state commissioner arrive at assumption the capital of the republic on the|25th|of|january,|1859 and leave on the|17th|of|february have in three|weeks ably and successfully accomplish all the object of mission the treaty which have conclude will be immediately submit to the senate in the view that the employment of other than peaceful mean may become necessary to obtain just satisfaction from paraguay a strong naval force be concentrate in the water of the|la|plata to await contingency whilst commissioner ascend the river to assumption be entitle to great credit for the promptness efficiency and economy with which this expedition be fit out and conduct consist of armed vessel great and small carry gun and man all under the command of the veteran and gallant shubrick the entire expense of the expedition have be defray out of the ordinary appropriation for the naval service except the sum of apply to the purchase of of the steamer constitute a part of under the authority of the naval appropriation act of the 3d march last be believe that these steamer be worth more than cost and be all now usefully and actively employ in the naval service the appearance of so large a force fit out in such a prompt manner in the far distant water of the la plata and the admirable conduct of the officer and man employ in have have a happy effect in favor of country throughout all that remote portion of the world relation with the great empire of france and russia as well as with all other government on the continent of europe unless may except that of spain happily continue to be of the most friendly character in last annual message present a statement of the unsatisfactory condition of relation with spain and regret to say that this have not materially improve without special reference to other claim even the cuban claim the payment of which have be ably urge by minister and in which of citizen be directly interested remain unsatisfied notwithstanding both justice and amount have be recognize and ascertain by the|spanish|government again recommend that an appropriation be make to be pay to the|spanish|government for the purpose of distribution among the claimant in the amistad case in common with of predecessor entertain no doubt that this be require by treaty with spain of the|27th|october,|1795 the failure to discharge this obligation have be employ by the cabinet of madrid as a reason against the settlement of claim need not repeat the argument which urge in last annual message in favor of the acquisition of cuba by fair purchase opinion on that measure remain unchanged therefore again invite the serious attention of congress to this important subject without a recognition of this policy on part will be almost impossible to institute negotiation with any reasonable prospect of success until a recent period there be good reason to believe that should be able to announce to on the present occasion that difficulty with arise out of the clayton and bulwer treaty have be finally adjust in a manner alike honorable and satisfactory to both party from cause however which have not anticipate have not yet complete treaty arrangement with the republics of honduras and nicaragua in pursuance of the understanding between the government be nevertheless confidently expect that this good work will ere long be accomplish whilst indulge the hope that no other subject remain which could disturb the good understanding between the country the question arise out of the adverse claim of the party to the island of san|juan under the oregon treaty of the|15th|june,|1846 suddenly assume a threatening prominence in order to prevent unfortunate collision on that remote frontier the late secretary of state on the|17th|july,|1855 address a note to mr. crampton then british minister at washington communicate to a copy of the instruction which mr. marcy have give on to governor stevens of washington|territory have a special reference to an apprehend conflict between citizen and the british subject on the island of san|juan to prevent this the governor be instruct that the officer of the territory should abstain from all act on the dispute ground which be calculate to provoke any conflict so far as can be do without imply the concession to the authority of of an exclusive right over the premise the title ought to be settle before either party should attempt to exclude the other by force or exercise complete and exclusive sovereign right within the fairly dispute limit in acknowledge the receipt on the|next|day of mr. marcy 's note the british minister express entire concurrence in the propriety of the course recommend to the governor of washington|territory by mr. marcy 's instruction to that officer and state that have lose no time in transmit a copy of that document to the governor general of british north|america and have earnestly recommend to excellency to take such measure as to may appear best calculate to secure on the part of the british local authority and the inhabitant of the neighborhood of the line in question the exercise of the same spirit of forbearance which be inculcate by mr. marcy on the authority and citizen of the|united|state thus matter remain upon the faith of this arrangement until the|9th|july|last when general harney pay a visit to the island find upon american resident with family and also an establishment of the|hudsons|bay|company for the purpose of raise sheep a short time before arrival of these resident have shoot an animal belong to the company whilst trespass upon premise for which however offer to pay twice value but that be refuse soon after the chief factor of the company at victoria mr. dalles son in law of governor douglas come to the island in the british sloop of war satellite and threaten to take this american mr. cutler by force to victoria to answer for the trespass have commit the american seize rifle and tell mr. dalles if any such attempt be make would kill upon the spot the affair then end under these circumstance the american settler present a petition to the general through the united|states inspector of custom mr. hubbs to place a force upon the island to protect from the indians as well as the oppressive interference of the authority of the|hudsons|bay|company at victoria with right as american citizen the general immediately respond to this petition and order captain george|e.|pickett ninth|infantry to establish company on bellevue or on some suitable position near the harbor at the southeastern extremity this order be promptly obey and a military post be establish at the place designate the force be afterwards increase so that by the last return the whole number of troop then on the island amount in the aggregate to man whilst do not deem proper on the present occasion to go further into the subject and discuss the weight which ought to be attach to the statement of the british colonial authority contest the accuracy of the information on which the gallant general act be due to that should thus present own reason for issue the order to captain pickett from these be quite clear object be to prevent the british authority on from exercise jurisdiction over american resident on the island of san|juan as well as to protect against the incursion of the indians much excitement prevail for some time throughout that region and serious danger of collision between the party be apprehend the british have a large naval force in the vicinity and be but an act of simple justice to the admiral on that station to state that wisely and discreetly forbore to commit any hostile act but determine to refer the whole affair to government and await instruction this aspect of the matter in opinion demand serious attention would have be a great calamity for both nation have be precipitate into act of hostility not on the question of title to the island but merely concern what should be condition during the intervene period whilst the government may be employ in settle the question to which of belong for this reason lieutenant general|scott be dispatch on the|17th|of|september|last to washington|territory to take immediate command of the|united|states force on should deem this necessary the main object of mission be to carry out the spirit of the precautionary arrangement between the late secretary of state and the british minister and thus to preserve the peace and prevent collision between the british and american authority pende the negotiation between the government entertain no doubt of the validity of title need scarcely add that in any event american citizen be to be place on a footing at least as favorable as that of british subject be understand that captain|pickett 's company should remain on the island be proper to observe that consider the distance from the scene of action and in ignorance of what may have transpire on the spot before the general 's arrival be necessary to leave much to discretion and be happy to state the event have prove that this discretion could not have be intrust to more competent hand general scott have recently return from mission have successfully accomplish object and there be no longer any good reason to apprehend a collision between the force of the country during the pendency of the exist negotiation regret to inform that there have be no improvement in the affair of mexico since last annual message and be again oblige to ask the earnest attention of congress to the unhappy condition of that republic the constituent congress|of|mexico which adjourn on the|17th|february,|1857 adopt a constitution and provide for a popular election this take place in the follow july and general|comonfort be choose president almost without opposition at the same election a new congress be choose whose first session commence on the|16th|of|september by the constitution of the presidential term be to begin on the|1st|of|december and continue for four|years on that|day general comonfort appear before the assemble congress in the|city|of|mexico take the oath to support the new constitution and be duly inaugurate as president within a|month afterwards have be drive from the capital and a military rebellion have assign the supreme power of the republic to general zuloaga the constitution provide that in the absence of the president office should devolve upon the chief justice of the supreme court and general|comonfort have leave the country this functionary general juarez proceed to form at guanajuato a constitutional government before this be officially know however at the capital the government|of|zuloaga have be recognize by the entire diplomatic corp include the minister of the|united|state as the government of mexico the constitutional president nevertheless maintain position with firmness and be soon establish with cabinet at vera|cruz meanwhile the government|of|zuloaga be earnestly resist in many part of the republic and even in the capital a portion of the army have pronounce against function be declare terminate and an assembly of citizen be invite for the choice of a new president this assembly elect general miramort but that officer repudiate the plan under which be choose and zuloaga be thus restore to previous position assume however only to withdraw from and miramon have become by appointment president substitute continue with that title at the head of the insurgent party in last annual message communicate to congress the circumstance under which the late minister of the|united|state suspend official relation with the central government and withdraw from the country be impossible to maintain friendly intercourse with a government like that at the capital under whose usurped authority wrong be constantly commit but never redress have this be an establish government with power extend by the consent of the people over the whole of mexico a resort to hostility against would have be quite justifiable and indeed necessary but the country be a prey to civil war and be hope that the success of the constitutional president may lead to a condition of thing less injurious to the|united|state this success become so probable that in january last employ a reliable agent to visit mexico and report to the actual condition and prospect of the contend party in consequence of report and from information which reach from other source favorable to the prospect of the constitutional cause feel justified in appoint a new minister to mexico who may embrace the early suitable opportunity of restore diplomatic relation with that republic for this purpose a distinguished citizen of maryland be select who proceed on mission on the|8th|of|march|last with discretionary authority to recognize the government of president juarez if on arrival in mexico should find entitled to such recognition accord to the establish practice of the|united|state on the|7th|of|april follow mr. mclane present credential to president juarez have no hesitation in pronounce the|government|of|juarez to be the only exist government of the republic be cordially receive by the authority at vera|cruz and have ever since manifest the most friendly disposition toward the|united|state unhappily however the constitutional government have not be able to establish power over the whole republic be support by a large majority of the people and the states but there be important part of the country where can enforce no obedience general miramon maintain at the capital and in some of the distant provinces there be military governor who pay little respect to the decree of either government in the meantime the excess which always attend upon civil war especially in mexico be constantly recur outrage of the bad description be commit both upon person and property there be scarcely any form of injury which have not be suffer by citizen in mexico during the|last|few|year have be nominally at peace with that republic but so far as the interest of commerce or of citizen who have visit the country as merchant shipmaster or in other capacity be concern may as well have be at war life have be insecure property unprotected and trade impossible except at a risk of loss which prudent man can not be expect to incur important contract involve large expenditure enter into by the central government have be set at defiance by the local government peaceful american resident occupy rightful possession have be suddenly expel the country in defiance of treaty and by the mere force of arbitrary power even the course of justice have not be safe from control and a recent decree of miramort permit the intervention of government in all suit where either party be a foreigner vessel of the|united|state have be seize without law and a consular officer who protest against such seizure have be fin and imprison for disrespect to the authority military contribution have be levy in violation of every principle of right and the american who resist the lawless demand have have property forcibly take away and have be banish from a conflict of authority in different part of the country tariff duty which have be pay in place have be exact over again in another place large number of citizen have be arrest and imprison without any form of examination or any opportunity for a hearing and even when release have only obtain liberty after much suffering and injury and without any hope of redress the wholesale massacre of crabbe and associate without trial in sonora as well as the seizure and murder of sick americans who have take shelter in the house of an american upon the soil of the|united|state be communicate to congress at last session murder of a still more atrocious character have be commit in the very heart of mexico under the authority of miramon's|government during the|present|year some of these be only worthy of a barbarous age and if have not be dearly prove would have seem impossible in a country which claim to be civilized of this description be the brutal massacre in april last by order of of american physician who be seize in the hospital at tacubaya while attend upon the sick and the dying of both party and without trial as without crime be hurry away to speedy execution little less shocking be the recent fate of ormond|chase who be shoot in tepic on the|7th|of|august by order of the same mexican general not only without a trial but without any conjecture by friend of the cause of arrest be represent as a young man of good character and intelligence who have make numerous friend in tepic by the courage and humanity which have display on several try occasion and death be as unexpected as be shocking to the whole community other outrage may be enumerate but these be sufficient to illustrate the wretched state of the country and the unprotected condition of the person and property of citizen in mexico in all these case minister have be constant and faithful in demand for redress but both and this government which have successively represent have be wholly powerless to make demand effective testimony in this respect and in reference to the only remedy which in judgment would meet the exigency have be both uniform and emphatic nothing but a manifestation of the power of write late minister in and of purpose to punish these wrong will avail assure that the universal belief here be that there be nothing to be apprehend from and that local mexican official can commit these outrage upon american citizen with absolute impunity hope the president write present minister in august last will feel authorized to ask from congress the power to enter mexico with the military force of the|united|state at the call of the constitutional authority in order to protect the citizen and the treaty right of the|united|state unless such a power be confer upon neither the one nor the other will be respect in the exist state of anarchy and disorder and the outrage already perpetrate will never be chastise and as assure in no . all these evil must increase until every vestige of order and government disappear from the country have be reluctantly lead to the same opinion and in justice to countryman who have suffer wrong from mexico and who may still suffer feel bind to announce this conclusion to congress the case present however be not merely a case of individual claim although just claim against mexico have reach a very large amount nor be merely the case of protection to the life and property of the few americans who may still remain in mexico although the life and property of every american citizen ought to be sacredly protect in every quarter of the world but be a question which relate to the future as well as to the present and the past and which involve indirectly at least the whole subject of duty to mexico as a neighboring state the exercise of the power of the|united|state in that country to redress the wrong and protect the right of own citizen be none the less to be desire because efficient and necessary aid may thus be render at the same time to restore peace and order to mexico in the accomplishment of this result the people of the|united|state must necessarily feel a deep and earnest interest mexico ought to be a rich and prosperous and powerful republic possess an extensive territory a fertile soil and an incalculable store of mineral wealth occupy an important position between the gulf and the ocean for transit route and for commerce be possible that such a country as this can be give up to anarchy and ruin without an effort from any|quarter for rescue and safety will the commercial nation of the world which have so many interest connect with remain wholly indifferent to such a result can especially which ought to share most largely in commercial intercourse allow immediate neighbor thus to destroy and injure yet without support from some|quarter be impossible to perceive how mexico can resume position among nation and enter upon a career which promise any good result the aid which require and which the interest of all commercial country require that should have belong to this government to render not only by virtue of neighborhood to mexico along whose territory have a continuous frontier of nearly|a|thousand|mile but by virtue also of establish policy which be inconsistent with the intervention of any european power in the domestic concern of that republic the wrong which have suffer from mexico be before the world and must deeply impress every american citizen a government which be either unable or unwilling to redress such wrong be derelict to high duty the difficulty consist in select and enforce the remedy may in vain apply to the constitutional government at vera|cruz although be well disposed to do justice for adequate redress whilst authority be acknowledge in all the important port and throughout the seacoast of the republic power do not extend to the|city|of|mexico and the states in vicinity where nearly all the recent outrage have be commit on american citizen must penetrate into the interior before can reach the offender and this can only be do by pass through the territory in the occupation of the constitutional government the most acceptable and least difficult mode of accomplish the object will be to act in concert with that government consent and aid may believe be obtain but if not obligation to protect own citizen in just right secure by treaty would not be the less imperative for these reason recommend to congress to pass a law authorize the president under such condition as may deem expedient to employ a sufficient military force to enter mexico for the purpose of obtain indemnity for the past and security for the future purposely refrain from any suggestion as to whether this force shall consist of regular troop or volunteer or both this question may be most appropriately leave to the decision of congress would merely observe that should volunteer be select such a force could be easily raise in this country among those who sympathize with the suffering of unfortunate fellow citizen in mexico and with the unhappy condition of that republic such an accession to the force of the constitutional government would enable soon to reach the|city|of|mexico and extend power over the whole republic in that event there be no reason to doubt that the just claim of citizen would be satisfied and adequate redress obtain for the injury inflict upon the constitutional government have ever evince a strong desire to do justice and this may be secure in advance by a preliminary treaty may be say that these measure will at least indirectly be inconsistent with wise and settled policy not to interfere in the domestic concern of foreign nation but do not the present case fairly constitute an exception an adjoin republic be in a state of anarchy and confusion from which have prove wholly unable to extricate be entirely destitute of the power to maintain peace upon border or to prevent the incursion of banditti into territory in fate and in fortune in power to establish and maintain a settle government have a far deep interest socially commercially and politically than any other nation be now a wreck upon the ocean drift about as be impel by different faction as a good neighbor shall not extend to a help hand to save if do not would not be surprising should some other nation undertake the task and thus force to interfere at last under circumstance of increase difficulty for the maintenance of establish policy repeat the recommendation contain in last annual message that authority may be give to the president to establish or more temporary military post across the mexican line in sonora|and|chihuahua where these may be necessary to protect the life and property of american and mexican citizen against the incursion and depredation of the indians as well as of lawless rover on that remote region the establishment of such post at a point call arispe in sonora in a country now almost depopulate by the hostile inroad of the indians from side of the line would be believe have prevent much injury and many cruelty during the|past|season a state of lawlessness and violence prevail on that distant frontier life and property be there wholly insecure the population of arizona now number more|than|10,000 soul be practically destitute of government of law or of any regular administration of justice murder rapine and other crime be commit with impunity therefore again call the attention of congress to the necessity for establish a territorial government over arizona the treaty with nicaragua of the|16th|of|february,|1857 to which refer in last annual message fail to receive the ratification of the government of that republic for reason which need not enumerate a similar treaty have be since conclude between the party bear date on the|16th|march,|1859 which have already be ratify by the|nicaraguan|congress this will be immediately submit to the senate for ratification provision can not think fail to be acceptable to the people of both country claim against the government of costa|rica and nicaragua remain unredressed though be press in an earnest manner and not without hope of success deem to be duty once more earnestly to recommend to congress the passage of a law authorize the president to employ the naval force at command for the purpose of protect the life and property of american citizen pass in transit across the panama nicaragua and tehuantepec route against sudden and lawless outbreak and depredation shall not repeat the argument employ in former message in support of this measure suffice to say that the life of many of people and the security of vast amount of treasure pass and repasse over or more of these route between the atlantic and pacific may be deeply involved in the action of congress on this subject would also again recommend to congress that authority be give to the president to employ the naval force to protect american merchant vessel crew and cargo against violent and lawless seizure and confiscation in the port of mexico and the spanish|american state when these country may be in a disturbed and revolutionary condition the mere knowledge that such an authority have be confer as have already state would of in a great degree prevent the evil neither would this require any additional appropriation for the naval service the chief objection urge against the grant of this authority be that congress by confer would violate the constitution that would be a transfer of the war making or strictly speak the war declare power to the executive if this be well round would of course be conclusive a very brief examination however will place this objection at rest congress possess the sole and exclusive power under the constitution to declare war alone can"raise and support army and provide and maintain a navy but after congress shall have declare war and provide the force necessary to carry on the president as commander in chief of the army and navy can alone employ this force in make war against the enemy this be the plain language and history prove that be the well know intention of the framer of the constitution will not be deny that the general power to declare war be without limitation and embrace within not only what writer on the law of nation term a public or perfect war but also an imperfect war and in short every specie of hostility however confine or limited without the authority of congress the president can not fire a hostile gun in any case except to repel the attack of an enemy will not be doubt that under this power congress could if think proper authorize the president to employ the force at command to seize a vessel belong to an american citizen which have be illegally and unjustly capture in a foreign port and restore to owner but can congress only act after the fact after the mischief have be do have no power to confer upon the president the authority in advance to furnish instant redress should such a case afterwards occur must wait until the mischief have be do and can apply the remedy only when be too late to confer this authority to meet future case under circumstance strictly specify be as clearly within the war declare power as such an authority confer upon the president by act of congress after the deed have be do in the progress of a great nation many exigency must arise imperatively require that congress should authorize the president to act promptly on certain condition which may or may not afterwards arise history have already present a number of such case shall refer only to the late under the resolution of june|2,|1858 for the adjustment of difficulty with the|republic|of|paraguay the president be authorize to adopt such measure and use such force as in judgment may be necessary and advisable in the event of a refusal of just satisfaction by the government|of|paraguay just satisfaction for what for the attack on steamer water|witch and other matter refer to in the annual message of the president here the power be expressly grant upon the condition that the government|of|paraguay shall refuse to render this just satisfaction in this and other similar case congress have confer upon the president power in advance to employ the army and navy upon the happening of contingent future event and this most certainly be embrace within the power to declare war now if this conditional and contingent power could be constitutionally confer upon the president in the case of paraguay why may not be confer for the purpose of protect the life and property of american citizen in the event that may be violently and unlawfully attack in pass over the transit route to and from california or assail by the seizure of vessel in a foreign port to deny this power be to render the navy in a great degree useless for the protection of the life and property of american citizen in country where neither protection nor redress can be otherwise obtain the fifth congress terminate on the of march without have pass the act make appropriation for the service of the|post office|department during the|fiscal|year|ending|the|30th|of|june,|1860 this act also contain an appropriation to supply deficiency in the revenue of the|post office|department for the|year|ending|30th|june,|1859 believe this be the first instance since the origin of the|federal|government now more|than|seventy|years|ago when any congress go out of existence without have pass all the general appropriation bill necessary to carry on the government until the regular period for the meeting of a new congress this event impose on the executive a grave responsibility present a choice of evil have this omission of duty occur at the first session of the last congress the remedy would have be plain may then have instantly recall to complete work and this without expense to the government but on the|4th|of|march last there be of the states which have not elect any representatives to the present congress have congress be call together immediately these state would have be virtually disfranchise if an intermediate period have be select several of the states would have be compel to hold extra session of legislature at great inconvenience and expense to provide for election at an early day than that previously fix by law in the regular course of these states would not elect until after the|beginning|of|august and of these not until october and november on the other hand when come to examine carefully the condition of the|post office|department do not meet as many or as great difficulty as have apprehend have the bill which fail be confine to appropriation for the|fiscal|year|ending|on|the|30th|june|next there would have be no reason of press importance for the call of an extra session nothing would become due on contract those with railroad company only except for carry the mail for the|first|quarter|of|the|present|fiscal|year commence on the|1st|of|july until the|1st|of|december less|than|one|week before the meeting of the present congress the reason be that the mail contractor for this and the|current|year do not complete their|first|quarter 's service until the|30th|september|last and by the term of contract sixty|day more be allow for the settlement of account before the department could be call upon for payment the great difficulty and the great hardship consist in the failure to provide for the payment of the deficiency in the department have enter into contract in obedience to exist law for the service of that|fiscal|year and the contractor be fairly entitle to compensation as become due the deficiency as state in the bill amount to but after a careful settlement of all these account have be ascertain that amount to with the scanty mean at command the|postmaster general have manage to pay that portion of this deficiency which occur in the|first|two|quarters|of|the|past|fiscal|year end on the|31st|december|last in the meantime the contractor under these try circumstance have behave in a manner worthy of all commendation have resource in the midst of embarrassment after the amount due to each of have be ascertain and finally settle accord to law this become a specific debt of record against the|united|state which enable to borrow money on this unquestionable security still be oblige to pay interest in consequence of the default of congress and on every principle of justice ought to receive interest from the government this interest should commence from the date when a warrant would have issue for the payment of the principal have an appropriation be make for this purpose calculated up|to|the|1st|december will not exceed sum not to be take into account when contrast with the great difficulty and embarrassment of a public and private character both to the people and the states which would have result from convene and hold a special session of congress for these reason recommend the passage of a bill at as|early|a|day as may be practicable to provide for the payment of the amount with interest due to these last mention contractor as well as to make the necessary appropriation for the service of the|post office|department for the failure to pass the|post office bill necessarily give birth to serious reflection congress by refuse to pass the general appropriation bill necessary to carry on the government may not only arrest action but may even destroy existence the army the navy the judiciary in short every department of the government can no longer perform function if congress refuse the money necessary for support if this failure should teach the country the necessity of elect a full congress in sufficient time to enable the president to convene in any emergency even immediately after the old congress have expire will have be productive of great good in a time of sudden and alarming danger foreign or domestic which all nation must expect to encounter in progress the very salvation of institution may be stake upon the assembling of congress without delay if under such circumstance the president should find in the condition in which be place at the close of the last congress with nearly half the|state of the union destitute of representative the consequence may disastrous therefore recommend to congress to carry into effect the provision of the constitution on this subject and to pass a law appointing some|day previous to the 4th march in each|year of odd number for the election of representatives throughout all the states have already appoint a|day for the election of elector for president and vice president and this measure have be approve by the country would again express a most decided opinion in favor of the construction of a pacific railroad for the reason state in last annual message when reflect upon what would be the defenseless condition of states and territories west of the|rocky|mountain in case of a war with a naval power sufficiently strong to interrupt all intercourse with by the route across the isthmus be still more convinced than ever of the vast importance of this railroad have never doubt the constitutional competency of congress to provide for construction but this exclusively under the war make power besides the constitution expressly require as an imperative duty that the|united|state shall protect each of the states against invasion be at a loss to conceive how this protection can be afford to california and oregon against such a naval power by any other mean repeat the opinion contain in last annual message that would be inexpedient for the government to undertake this great work by agent of own appointment and under direct and exclusive control this would increase the patronage of the executive to a dangerous extent and would foster a system of jobbing and corruption which no vigilance on the part of federal official could prevent the construction of this road ought therefore to be intrust to incorporate company or other agency who would exercise that active and vigilant supervision over which can be inspire alone by a sense of corporate and individual interest venture to assert that the additional cost of transport troop munition of war and necessary supply for the army across the vast intervene plain to possession on the|pacific|coast would be great in such a war than the whole amount require to construct the road and yet this resort would after all be inadequate for defense and protection have yet scarcely recover from the habit of extravagant expenditure produce by overflowing treasury during several|year prior to the commencement of administration the financial revers which have since experience ought to teach all to scrutinize expenditure with the great vigilance and to reduce to the low possible point the|executive|departments|of|the|government have devote to the accomplishment of this object with considerable success as will appear from different report and estimate to these invite the scrutiny of congress for the purpose of reduce still lower if this be practicable consistent with the great public interest of the country in aid of the policy of retrenchment pledge to examine closely the bill appropriate land or money so that if any of these should inadvertently pass both houses as must sometimes be the case may afford an opportunity for reconsideration at the same time ought never to forget that true public economy consist not in withhold the mean necessary to accomplish important national object confide to by the constitution but in take care that the money appropriate for these purpose shall be faithfully and frugally expended will appear from the report of the secretary of the treasury that be extremely doubtful to say the least whether shall be able to pass through the present and the|next|fiscal|year without provide additional revenue this can only be accomplish by strictly confine the appropriation within the estimate of the different departments without make an allowance for any additional expenditure which congress may think proper in discretion to authorize and without provide for the redemption of any portion of the of treasury note which have be already issue in the event of a deficiency which consider probable this ought never to be supply by a resort to additional loan would be a ruinous practice in the|day of peace and prosperity to go on increase the national debt to meet the ordinary expense of the government this policy would cripple resource and impair credit in case the existence of war should render necessary to borrow money should such a

and of the postmaster general each contain valuable information and important recommendation well worthy of the serious consideration of congress will appear from the report of the secretary of war that the army expenditure have be materially reduce by a system of rigid economy which in opinion offer every guaranty that the reduction will be permanent the estimate of the department for the next have be reduce nearly|$2,000,000 below the estimate for the|present|fiscal|year and below the amount grant for this|year at the last session of congress the expenditure of the|post office|department during end on the|30th|june,|1859 exclusive of payment for mail service specially provide for by congress out of the general treasury amount to and receipt to show a deficiency to be supply from the

the deficiency for the|current|fiscal|year will be but that for will not exceed should congress adopt the measure of reform propose and urge by the|postmaster general since the|month|of|march retrenchment have be make in the expenditure amount to annually which however do not take effect until after the commencement of the period seem to have arrive for determine the question whether this department shall become a permanent and ever increase charge upon the treasury or shall be permit to resume the self sustain policy which have so long control administration the course of legislation recommend by the|postmaster general for the relief of the department from present embarrassment and for restore to original independence be deserve of early and earnest consideration in conclusion would again commend to the just liberality of congress the local interest of surely the city bear the name of washington and destine trust for age to be the capital of united free and prosperous confederacy have strong claim on favorable regard transcript to the|house|of|representatives of the|united|state return with objection to the|house|of|representatives in which originate the bill entitle an act donate public land to the several states and territories which may provide college for the benefit of agriculture and the mechanic art present to on the 18th instant this bill make a donation to the several states of of the public land for each senator and representative in the present congress and also an additional donation of for each additional representative to which any state may be entitle under the census of accord to a report from the|interior|department base upon the present number of senators|and|representative the land give to the states amount to 6,060,000|acre and value at the minimum government price of per acre to the object of this gift as state by the bill be the endowment support and maintenance of at|least|one college in each state where the lead object shall be without exclude other scientific or classical study to teach such branch of learn as be relate to agriculture and the mechanic art as the legislature of the states may respectively prescribe in order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial class in the several pursuit and profession in life as there do not appear from the bill to be any beneficiary in existence to which this endowment can be apply each state be require to provide within five|year at least not less than college or the grant to say state shall cease in that event the say state shall be bind to pay the|united|state the amount receive of any land previously sell and that the title to purchaser under the state shall be valid the grant in land be confine to such states as have public land within limit worth per acre in the opinion of the governor for the remain states the secretary of the interior be direct to issue land scrip to the amount of distributive share in acre under the provision of this act say scrip to be sell by say states and the proceed thereof apply to the us and purpose prescribe in this act and for no other use or purpose whatsoever the land be grant and the scrip be to be issue in section or subdivision of section of not less than quarter of a section accord to an estimate from the|interior|department the number of acre which will probably be accept by state have public land within own limit will not exceed and may be much less leave a balance of 5,480,000|acre to be provide for by scrip these grant of land and land scrip to each of the state be make upon certain condition the principal of which be that if the fund shall be lose or diminish on account of unfortunate investment or otherwise the deficiency shall be replace and make good by the respective states shall now proceed to state objection to this bill deem to be both inexpedient and unconstitutional this bill have be pass at a period when can with great difficulty raise sufficient revenue to sustain the expense of the government should become a law the treasury will be deprive of the whole or nearly the whole of income from the sale of public land which for the|next|fiscal|year have be estimate at a bare statement of the case will make this evident the minimum price at which dispose of land be per acre at the present moment however the price have be reduce to those who purchase the bounty land warrant of the old soldier to per acre and of these warrant there be still outstanding and unlocated as appear by a report february|12,|1859 from the|general|land|office the amount of this have already greatly reduce the current sale by the government and diminish the revenue from this source if in addition state shall enter the market with land scrip the price must be greatly reduce below even per acre as much to the prejudice of the old soldier who have not already part with land warrant as to government be easy to perceive that with this glut of the market government can sell little or no land at per acre when the price of bounty land warrant and scrip shall be reduce to half this sum this source of revenue will be almost entirely dry up under the bill the states may sell land scrip at any price may bring there be no limitation whatever in this respect indeed must sell for what the scrip will bring for without this fund can not proceed to establish college within the|five|years to which be limit be manifest therefore that to the extent to which this bill will prevent the sale of public land at per acre to that amount will have precisely the same effect upon the treasury as if should impose a tax to create a loan to endow these state college surely the present be the most unpropitious moment which could have be select for the passage of this bill waive for the present the question of constitutional power what effect will this bill have on the relation establish between the|federal|and|state|government the constitution be a grant to congress of a few enumerate but most important power relate chiefly to war peace foreign and domestic commerce negotiation and other subject which can be good or alone exercise beneficially by the common government all other power be reserve to the states and to the people for the efficient and harmonious working of both be necessary that several sphere of action should be keep distinct from each other this alone can prevent conflict and mutual injury should the time ever arrive when the state government shall look to the|federal|treasury for the mean of support and maintain system of education and internal policy the character of both government will be greatly deteriorate the representative of the states and of the people feel a more immediate interest in obtain money to lighten the burden of constituent than for the promotion of the more distant object intrust to the|federal|government will naturally incline to obtain mean from the|federal|government for state purpose if a question shall arise between an appropriation of land or money to carry into effect the object of the|federal|government and those of the states feeling will be enlist in favor of the latter this be human nature and hence the necessity of keep the government entirely distinct the preponderance of this home feeling have be manifest by the passage of the present bill the establishment of these college have prevail over the press want of the common treasury no nation ever have such an inheritance as possess in the public land these ought to be manage with the utmost care but at the same time with a liberal spirit toward actual settler in the|first|year of a war with a powerful naval nation the revenue from custom must in a great degree cease a resort to loan will then become necessary and these can always be obtain as father obtain on advantageous term by pledge the public land as security in this view of the subject would be wise to grant money to the states for domestic purpose than to squander away the public land and transfer in large body into the hand of speculator a successful struggle on the part of the state government with the|general|government for the public land would deprive the latter of the mean of perform high duty especially at critical and dangerous period besides would operate with equal detriment to the good interest of the states would remove the most wholesome of all restraint on legislative body that of be oblige to raise money by taxation from constituent and would lead to extravagance if not to corruption what be obtain easily and without responsibility will be lavishly expended this bill should become a law will operate greatly to the injury of the new states the progress of settlement and the increase of an industrious population own an interest in the soil cultivate be the cause which will build up into great and flourishing commonwealth nothing could be more prejudicial to interest than for wealthy individual to acquire large tract of the public land and hold for speculative purpose the low price to which this land scrip will probably be reduce will tempt speculator to buy in large amount and locate on the good land belong to the government the eventual consequence must be that the man who desire to cultivate the soil will be compel to purchase these very land at rate much high than the price at which could be obtain from the government be extremely doubtful to say the least whether this bill would contribute to the advancement of agriculture and the mechanic art object the dignity and value of which can not be too highly appreciate the|federal|government which make the donation have confessedly no constitutional power to follow into the states and enforce the application of the fund to the intend object as donor shall possess no control over own gift after shall have pass from hand be true that the state legislature be require to stipulate that will faithfully execute the trust in the manner prescribe by the bill but should fail to do this what would be the consequence the|federal|government have no power and ought to have no power to compel the execution of the trust would be in as helpless a condition as if even in this the time of great need be to demand any portion of the|many|millions of surplus revenue deposit with the states for safekeepe under the act of this bill will injuriously interfere with exist college in the different states in many of which agriculture be teach as a science and in all of which ought to be so teach these institution of learning have grow up with the growth of the country under the fostering care of the states and the munificence of individual to meet the advance demand for education have prove great blessing to the people many indeed most of be poor and sustain with difficulty what the effect will be on these institution of create an indefinite number of rival college sustain by the endowment of the|federal|government be not difficult to determine under this bill be provide that scientific and classical study shall not be exclude from indeed would be almost impossible to sustain without such a provision for no father would incur the expense of send a son to of these institution for the sole purpose of make a scientific farmer or mechanic the bill negative this idea and declare that object be to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial class in the several pursuit and profession of life this certainly ought to be the case in this view of the subject would be far well if such an appropriation of land must be make to institution of learn in the several states to apply directly to the establishment of professorship of agriculture and the mechanic art in exist college without the intervention of the state legislature would be difficult to foresee how these legislature will manage this fund each representative in congress for whose district the proportion of have be grant will probably insist that the proceed shall be expend within limit there will undoubtedly be a struggle between different locality in each state concern the division of the gift which may end in disappoint the hope of the true friend of agriculture for this state of thing be without remedy not so in regard to state college may grant land to these corporation to establish agricultural and mechanical professorship and should fail to comply with the condition on which accept the grant may enforce specific performance of these before the ordinary court of justice but do congress possess the power under the constitution to make a donation of public land to the different states of the union to provide college for the purpose of educate own people presume the general proposition be undeniable that congress do not possess the power to appropriate money in the treasury raise by taxis on the people of the|united|state for the purpose of educate the people of the respective states will not be pretend that any such power be to be find among the specific power grant to congress nor that be necessary and proper for carry into execution any of these power should congress exercise such a power this would be to break down the barrier which have be so carefully construct in the constitution to separate federal from state authority should then not only lay and collect taxis duty impost and excise for federal purpose but for every state purpose which congress may deem expedient or useful this would be an actual consolidation of the|federal|and|state|government so far as the great taxing and money power be concern and constitute a sort of partnership between the in the treasury of the|united|state equally ruinous to both but be contend that the public land be place upon a different footing from money raise by taxation and that the proceed arise from sale be not subject to the limitation of the constitution but may be appropriate or give away by congress at own discretion to states corporation or individual for any purpose may deem expedient the advocate of this bill attempt to sustain position upon the language of the second clause of the third section of the fourth article of the constitution which declare that the congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rule and regulation respect the territory or other property belong to the|united|state contend that by a fair interpretation of the word dispose of in this clause congress possess the power to make this gift of public land to the states for purpose of education would require clear and strong evidence to induce the belief that the framer of the constitution after have limit the power of congress to certain precise and specific object intend by employ the word dispose of to give that body unlimited power over the vast public domain would be a strange anomaly indeed to have create fund the by taxation confine to the execution of the enumerate power delegate to congress and the other from the public land applicable to all subject foreign and domestic which congress may designate that this fund should be dispose of not to pay the debt of the|united|state nor to raise and support army nor to provide and maintain a navy nor to accomplish any of the other great object enumerate in the constitution but be divert from to pay the debt of the states to educate people and to carry into effect any other measure of domestic policy this would be to confer upon congress a vast and irresponsible authority utterly at war with the well know jealousy of federal power which prevail at the formation of the constitution the natural intendment would be that as the constitution confine congress to well define specific power the fund place at command whether in land or money should be appropriate to the performance of the duty correspond with these power if not a government have be create with all other power carefully limited but without any limitation in respect to the public land but can not so read the word dispose of as to make embrace the idea of give away the true meaning of word be always to be ascertain by the subject to which be apply and the know general intent of the lawgiver congress be a trustee under the constitution for the people of the|united|state to dispose of public land and think may venture to assert with confidence that no case can be find in which a trustee in the position of congress have be authorize to dispose of property by owner where have be hold that these word authorize such trustee to give away the fund intrust to care no trustee when call upon to account for the disposition of the property place under management before any judicial tribunal would venture to present such a plea in defense the true meaning of these word be clearly state by chief justice taney in deliver the opinion of the court howard p. say in reference to this clause of the constitution begin enumeration of power by that of dispose in other word make sale of the land or raise money from which as have already say be the main object of the cession from the states and which be the first thing provide for in the article be unnecessary to refer to the history of the time to establish the know fact that this statement of the chief justice be perfectly well rounded that never be intend by the framer of the constitution that these land should be give away by congress be manifest from the conclude portion of the same clause by congress have power not only to dispose of the territory but of the other property of the|united|state in the language of the chief justice p. and the same power of make needful rule respect the territory be in precisely the same language apply to the other property of the|united|state associate the power over the territory in this respect with the power over movable or personal property that is the ship arm or munition of war which then belong in common to the state sovereignty the question be still clear in regard to the public land in the states and territories within the louisiana and florida purchase these land be pay for out of the public treasury from money raise by taxation now if congress have no power to appropriate the money with which these land be purchase be not clear that the power over the land be equally limited the mere conversion of this money into land could not confer upon congress new power over the disposition of land which have not possess over money if could then a trustee by change the character of the fund intrust to care for special object from money into land may give the land away or devote to any purpose think proper however foreign from the trust the inference be irresistible that this land partake of the very same character with the money pay for and can be devote to no object different from those to which the money could have be devote if this be not the case then by the purchase of a new territory from a foreign government out of the public treasury congress could enlarge own power and appropriate the proceed of the sale of the land thus purchase at own discretion to other and far different object from what could have apply the purchase money which have be raise by taxation have be assert truly that congress in numerous instance have grant land for the purpose of education these grant have be chiefly if not exclusively make to the new states as successively enter the union and consist at the first of section and afterwards of section of the public land in each township for the use of school as well as of additional section for a state university such grant be not in opinion a violation of the constitution the|united|state be a great landed proprietor and from the very nature of this relation be both the right and the duty of congress as trustee to manage these land as any other prudent proprietor would manage for own good advantage now no consideration could be present of a strong character to induce the american people to brave the difficulty and hardship of frontier life and to settle upon these land and to purchase at a fair price than to give to and to child an assurance of the mean of education if any prudent individual have hold these land could not have adopt a wise course to bring into market and enhance value than to give a portion of for purpose of education as a mere speculation would pursue this course no person will contend that donation of land to all the states of the union for the erection of college within the limit of each can be embrace by this principle can not be pretend that an agricultural college in new|york or virginia would aid the settlement or facilitate the sale of public land in minnesota or california this can not possibly be embrace within the authority which a prudent proprietor of land would exercise over own possession purposely avoid any attempt to define what portion of land may be grant and for what purpose to improve the value and promote the settlement and sale of the remainder without violate the constitution in this case adopt the rule that sufficient unto the|day be the evil thereof transcript to the senate and house|of|representatif the brief period which remain of present session and the great urgency and importance of legislative action before termination for the protection of american citizen and property whilst in transit across the isthmus route between atlantic and pacific possession render duty again to recall this subject to notice have heretofore present in annual message both in december and to which beg leave to refer in the latter state that-- the executive government of this country in intercourse with foreign nation be limit to the employment of diplomacy alone when this fail can proceed no further can not legitimately resort to force without the direct authority of congress except in resist and repel hostile attack would have no authority to enter the territory of nicaragua even to prevent the destruction of the transit and protect the life and property of own citizen on passage be true that on a sudden emergency of this character the president would direct any armed force in the vicinity to march to relief but in do this would act upon own responsibility under these circumstance earnestly recommend to congress the passage of an act authorize the president under such restriction as may deem proper to employ the land and naval force of the|united|state in prevent the transit from be obstruct or close by lawless violence and in protect the life and property of american citizen travel thereupon require at the same time that these force shall be withdraw the moment the danger shall have pass away without such a provision citizen will be constantly expose to interruption in progress and to lawless violence a similar necessity exist for the passage of such an act for the protection of the panama and tehuantepec route another subject equally important command the attention of the senate at the last session of congress the republics south of the|united|state on this continent have unfortunately be frequently in a state of revolution and civil war ever since achieve independence as or the other party have prevail and obtain possession of the port open to foreign commerce have seize and confiscate american vessel and cargo in an arbitrary and lawless manner and exacted money from american citizen by force loan and other violent proceeding to enable to carry on hostility the executive government of great|britain france and other country possess the war make power can promptly employ the necessary mean to enforce immediate redress for similar outrage upon subject not so the executive government of the|united|state if the president order a vessel of war to any of these port to demand prompt redress for outrage commit the offend party be well aware that in case of refusal the commander can do no more than remonstrate can resort to no hostile act the question must then be refer to diplomacy and in many case adequate redress can never be obtain thus american citizen be deprive of the same protection under the flag of country which the subject of other nation enjoy the remedy for this state of thing can only be supply by congress since the constitution have confide to that body alone the power to make war without the authority of congress the executive can not lawfully direct any force however near may be to the scene of difficulty to enter the territory of mexico nicaragua or new|granada for the purpose of defend the person and property of american citizen even though may be violently assail whilst pass in peaceful transit over the tehuantepec nicaragua or panama route can not without transcend constitutional power direct a gun to be fire into a port or land a seaman or marine to protect the life of countryman on shore or to obtain redress for a recent outrage on property the banditti which infest neighboring republic|of|mexico always claim to belong to or other of the hostile party may make a sudden descent on vera|cruz or on the tehuantepec route and would have no power to employ the force on shipboard in the vicinity for relief either to prevent the plunder of merchant or the destruction of the transit in reference to country where the local authority be strong enough to enforce the law the difficulty here indicate can seldom happen but where this be not the case and the local authority do not possess the physical power even if possess the will to protect citizen within limit recent experience have show that the|american|executive should be authorize to render this protection such a grant of authority thus limit in extent could in no just sense be regard as a transfer of the war make power to the executive but only as an appropriate exercise of that power by the body to whom exclusively belong the riot at panama in in which a great number of citizen lose life furnish a pointed illustration of the necessity which may arise for the exertion of this authority therefore earnestly recommend to congress on whom the responsibility exclusively rest to pass a law before adjournment confer on the president the power to protect the life and property of american citizen in the case which have indicate under such restriction and condition as may deem advisable the knowledge that such a law exist would of go far to prevent the outrage which be intend to redress and to render the employment of force unnecessary without this the president may be place in a painful position before the meeting of the next congress in the present disturbed condition of mexico and or more of the other republics south of no person can foresee what occurrence may take place before that period in case of emergency citizen see that do not enjoy the same protection with subject of european|government will have just cause to complain on the other hand should the executive interpose and especially should the result prove disastrous and valuable life be lose may subject to severe censure for have assume a power not confide to by the constitution be to guard against this contingency that now appeal to congress have thus recommend to congress a measure which deem necessary and expedient for the interest and honor of the country leave the whole subject to wisdom and discretion transcript fellow citizens of the senate and house|of|representatif when compare the condition of the country at the|present|day with what be one|year|ago at the meeting of congress have much reason for gratitude to that almighty providence which have never fail to interpose for relief at the most critical period of history one|year|ago the sectional strife between the north and the south on the dangerous subject of slavery have again become so intense as to threaten the peace and perpetuity of the confederacy the application for the admission of kansas as a state into the union foster this unhappy agitation and bring the whole subject once more before congress be the desire of every patriot that such measure of legislation may be adopt as would remove the excitement from the states and confine to the territory where legitimately belong much have be do be happy to say toward the accomplishment of this object during the last session of congress the|supreme|court of the|united|state have previously decide that all american citizen have an equal right to take into the territories whatever be hold as property under the law of any of the states and to hold such property there under the guardianship of the|federal|constitution so long as the territorial condition shall remain this be now a well establish position and the proceeding of the last session be alone want to give practical effect the principle have be recognize in some form or other by an almost unanimous vote of both houses|of|congress that a territory have a right to come into the union either as a free or a slave state accord to the will of a majority of people the just equality of all the states have thus be vindicate and a fruitful source of dangerous dissension among have be remove whilst such have be the beneficial tendency of legislative proceeding outside of kansas influence have nowhere be so happy as within that territory leave to manage and control own affair in own way without the pressure of external influence the revolutionary topeka organization and all resistance to the territorial government establish by congress have be finally abandon as a natural consequence that fine territory now appear to be tranquil and prosperous and be attract increase thousand of immigrant to make happy home the past unfortunate experience of kansas have enforce the lesson so often already teach that resistance to lawful authority under form of government can not fail in the end to prove disastrous to author have the people of the territory yield obedience to the law enact by legislature would at the present moment have contain a large additional population of industrious and enterprising citizen who have be deter from enter border by the existence of civil strife and organized rebellion be the resistance to rightful authority and the persevere attempt to establish a revolutionary government under the topeka constitution which cause the people of kansas to commit the grave error of refuse to vote for delegate to the convention to frame a constitution under a law not deny to be fair and just in provision this refusal to vote have be the prolific source of all the evil which have follow in hostility to the territorial government disregard the principle absolutely essential to the working of form of government that a majority of those who vote not the majority who may remain at home from whatever cause must decide the result of an election for this reason seek to take advantage of own error deny the authority of the convention thus elect to frame a constitution the convention notwithstanding proceed to adopt a constitution unexceptionable in general feature and provide for the submission of the slavery question to a vote of the people which in opinion be bind to do under the kansas and nebraska act this be the all important question which have alone convulse the territory and yet the opponent of the lawful government persist in first error refrain from exercise right to vote and prefer that slavery should continue rather than surrender revolutionary topeka organization a wiser and well spirit seem to prevail before the|first|monday|of|january|last when an election be hold under the constitution a majority of the people then vote for a governor and other state officer for a member of congress and member of the state legislature this election be warmly contest by the political party in kansas and a great vote be poll than at any previous election a large majority of the member of the legislature elect belong to that party which have previously refuse to vote the antislavery party be thus place in the ascendant and the political power of the state be in own hand have congress admit kansas into the union under the lecompton constitution the legislature may at very first session have submit the question to a vote of the people whether would or would not have a convention to amend constitution either on the slavery or any other question and have adopt all necessary mean for give speedy effect to the will of the majority thus the kansas question would have be immediately and finally settle under these circumstance submit to congress the constitution thus frame with all the officer already elect necessary to put the state government into operation accompany by a strong recommendation in favor of the admission of kansas as a state in the course of long public life have never perform any official act which in the retrospect have afford more heartfelt satisfaction admission could have inflict no possible injury on any human being whilst would within a brief period have restore peace to kansas and harmony to the union in that event the slavery question would ere this have be finally settle accord to the legally express will of a majority of the voter and popular sovereignty would thus have be vindicate in a constitutional manner with deep conviction of duty could have pursue no other course be true that as an individual have express an opinion both before and during the session of the convention in favor of submit the remain clause of the constitution as well as that concern slavery to the people but act in an official character neither nor any human authority have the power to rejudge the proceeding of the convention and declare the constitution which have frame to be a nullity to have do this would have be a violation of the kansas and nebraska act which leave the people of the territory perfectly free to form and regulate domestic institution in own way subject only to the|united|state would equally have violate the great principle of popular sovereignty at the foundation of institution to deprive the people of the power if think proper to exercise of confide to delegate elect by the trust of frame a constitution without require to subject constituent to the trouble expense and delay of a second election would have be in opposition to many precedent in history commence in the very good age of the republic of the admission of territories as states into the union without a previous vote of the people approve constitution be to be lament that a question so insignificant when view in practical effect on the people of kansas whether decide way or the other should have kindle such a flame of excitement throughout the country this reflection may prove to be a lesson of wisdom and of warn for future guidance practically consider the question be simply whether the people of that territory should first come into the union and then change any provision in constitution not agreeable to or accomplish the very same object by remain out of the union and frame another constitution in accordance with will in either case the result would be precisely the same the only difference in point of fact be that the object would have be much sooner attain and the pacification of kansas more speedily effect have be admit as a state during the last session of congress recommendation however for the immediate admission of kansas fail to meet the approbation of congress deem wise to adopt a different measure for the settlement of the question for own part should have be willing to yield assent to almost any constitutional measure to accomplish this object therefore cordially acquiesce in what have be call the english compromise and approve the act for the admission of the|state|of|kansas into the union upon the term therein prescribe under the ordinance which accompany the lecompton constitution the people of kansas have claim double the quantity of public land for the support of common school which have ever be previously grant to any state upon enter the union and also the alternate section of land for on each side of railroad propose to be construct from the northern to the southern boundary and from the eastern to the western boundary of the state congress deem these claim unreasonable provide by the act of may|4,|1858 to which have just refer for the admission of the state on an equal footing with the original states but upon the fundamental condition precedent that a majority of the people thereof at an election to be hold for that purpose should in place of the very large grant of public land which have demand under the ordinance accept such grant as have be make to minnesota and other new states under this act should a majority reject the proposition offer shall be deem and hold that the people of kansas do not desire admission into the union with say constitution under the condition set forth in say proposition in that event the act authorize the people of the territory to elect delegate to form a constitution and state government for whenever and not before be ascertain by a census duly and legally take that the population of say territory equal or exceed the ratio of representation require for a member of the|house|of|representatives of the congress of the|united|state the delegate thus assemble shall first determine by a vote whether be the wish of the people of the propose state to be admit into the union at that time and if so shall proceed to form a constitution and take all necessary step for the establishment of a state government in conformity with the|federal|constitution after this constitution shall have be form congress carry out the principle of popular sovereignty and nonintervention have leave the mode and manner of approval or ratification by the people of the propose state to be prescribe by law and shall then be admit into the union as a state under such constitution thus fairly and legally make with or without slavery as say constitution may prescribe an election be hold throughout kansas in pursuance of the provision of this act on the|2d|day|of|august|last and result in the rejection by a large majority of the proposition submit to the people by congress this be the case be now authorize to form another constitution preparatory to admission into the union but not until number as ascertain by a census shall equal or exceed the ratio require to elect a member to the|house|of|representatives be not probable in the present state of the case that a third constitution can be lawfully frame and present to congress by kansas before population shall have reach the designate number nor be to be presume that after sad experience in resist the territorial law will attempt to adopt a constitution in express violation of the provision of an act of congress during the session of much of the time of congress be occupy on the question of admit kansas under the topeka constitution again nearly the whole of the last session be devoted to the question of admission under the lecompton constitution surely be not unreasonable to require the people of kansas to wait before make a third attempt until the number of inhabitant shall amount to during this brief period the harmony of the states as well as the great business interest of the country demand that the people of the union shall not for a third time be convulse by another agitation on the kansas question by wait for a short time and act in obedience to law kansas will glide into the union without the slight impediment this excellent provision which congress have apply to kansas ought to be extend and render applicable to all territories which may hereafter seek admission into the union whilst|congress possess the undoubted power of admit a new state into the union however small may be the number of inhabitant yet this power ought not in opinion to be exercise before the population shall amount to the ratio require by the act for the admission of kansas have this be previously the rule the country would have escape all the evil and misfortune to which have be expose by the kansas question of course would be unjust to give this rule a retrospective application and exclude a state which act upon the past practice of the government have already form constitution elect legislature and other officer and be now prepared to enter the union the rule ought to be adopt whether consider bearing on the people of the territories or upon the people of the exist states many of the serious dissention which have prevail in congress and throughout the country would have be avoid have this rule be establish at an early period of the government immediately upon the formation of a new territory people from different states and from foreign country rush into for the laudable purpose of improve condition first duty to be to open and cultivate farm to construct road to establish school to erect place of religious worship and to devote energy generally to reclaim the wilderness and to lay the foundation of a flourishing and prosperous commonwealth if in this incipient condition with a population of a|few|thousand should prematurely enter the union be oppress by the burden of state taxation and the mean necessary for the improvement of the territory and the advancement of own interest be thus divert to very different purpose the|federal|government have ever be a liberal parent to the territories and a generous contributor to the useful enterprise of the early settler have pay the expense of government and legislative assembly out of the common treasury and thus relieve from a heavy charge under these circumstance nothing can be better calculate to retard material progress than to divert from useful employment by prematurely exciting angry political contest among for the benefit of aspire leader be surely no hardship for embryo governor senator and members of congress to wait until the number of inhabitant shall equal those of a single congressional district surely ought not to be permit to rush into the union with a population less than half of several of the large county in the interior of some of the states this be the condition of kansas when make application to be admit under the topeka constitution besides require some time to render the mass of a population collect in a new territory at all homogeneous and to unite on anything like a fix policy establish the rule and all will look forward to and govern accordingly but justice to the people of the several states require that this rule should be establish by congress each state be entitle to senator and at least representative in congress should the people of the states fail to elect a vice president the power devolve upon the senate to select this officer from the high candidate on the list in case of the death of the president the vice president thus elect by the senate become president of the|united|state on all question of legislation the senators from the small states of the union have an equal vote with those from the large the same may be say in regard to the ratification of treaty and of executive appointment all this have work admirably in practice whilst conform in principle with the character of a government institute by sovereign states presume no american citizen would desire the slight change in the arrangement still be not unjust and unequal to the exist states to invest some|40,000 or people collect in a territory with the attribute of sovereignty and place on an equal footing with virginia and new|york in the senate of for these reason earnestly recommend the passage of a general act which shall provide that upon the application of a territorial legislature declare belief that the territory contain a number of inhabitant which if in a state would entitle to elect a member of congress shall be the duty of the president to cause a census of the inhabitant to be take and if find sufficient then by the term of this act to authorize to proceed in own way to frame a state constitution preparatory to admission into the union also recommend that an appropriation may be make to enable the president to take a census of the people of kansas the present condition of the|territory|of|utah when contrast with what be one|year|ago be a subject for congratulation be then in a state of open rebellion and cost what may the character of the government require that this rebellion should be suppress and the mormons compel to yield obedience to the constitution and the law in order to accomplish this object as inform in last|annual message appoint a new governor instead of brigham|young and other federal officer to take the place of those who consult personal safety have find necessary to withdraw from the territory to protect these civil officer and to aid as a posse comitatus in the execution of the law in case of need order a detachment of the army to accompany to utah the necessity for adopt these measure be now demonstrate on the|15th|of|september,|1857 governor young issue proclamation in the style of an independent sovereign announce purpose to resist by force of arm the entry of troop into own territory|of|utah by this require all the force in the territory to hold in readiness to march at a moment 's notice to repel any and all such invasion and establish martial law from date throughout the territory these prove to be no idle threat forts bridger and supply be vacate and burn down by the mormons to deprive troop of a shelter after long and fatigue march order be issue by daniel|h.|well style lieutenant general nauvoo|legion to stampede the animal of the|united|states troop on march to set fire to train to burn the grass and the whole country before and on flank to keep from sleep by night surprise and to blockade the road by fell tree and destroy the ford of river these order be promptly and effectually obey on the 4th of october the mormons capture and burn on of supply train consist of wagon load with provision and tent for the army and carry away several|hundred animal this diminish the supply of provision so materially that general johnston be oblige to reduce the ration and even with this precaution there be only sufficient leave to subsist the troop until the|1st|of|june little army behave admirably in encampment at fort|bridger under these try privation in the midst of the mountain in a dreary unsettled and inhospitable region from home pass the severe and inclement winter without a murmur look forward with confidence for relief from country in due season and in this be not disappointed the secretary of war employ all energy to forward the necessary supply and to muster and send such a military force to utah as would render resistance on the part of the mormons hopeless and thus terminate the war without the effusion of blood in effort be efficiently sustain by congress grant appropriation sufficient to cover the deficiency thus necessarily create and also provide for raise regiment of volunteer for the purpose of quell disturbance in the|territory|of|utah for the protection of supply and emigrant train and the suppression of indian hostility on the frontier happily there be no occasion to call these regiment into service if there have be should have feel serious embarrassment in select so great be the number of brave and patriotic citizen anxious to serve country in this distant and apparently dangerous expedition thus have ever be and thus may ever be the wisdom and economy of send sufficient reenforcement to utah be establish not only by the event but in the opinion of those who from position and opportunity be the most capable of form a correct judgment general johnston the commander of the force in address the secretary of war from fort|bridger under date of october|18,|1857 express the opinion that unless a large force be send here from the nature of the country a protract war on the mormons 's part be inevitable this consider necessary to terminate the war speedily and more economically than if attempt by insufficient mean in the meantime be anxious desire that the mormons should yield obedience to the constitution and the law without render necessary to resort to military force to aid in accomplish this object deem advisable in april last to dispatch distinguished citizen of the|united|state messrs. powell and mcculloch to utah bear with a proclamation address by to the inhabitant of utah date on warn of true condition and how hopeless be on part to persist in rebellion against the|united|state and offer all those who should submit to the law a full pardon for past sedition and treason at the same time assure those who should persist in rebellion against the|united|state that must expect no further lenity but look to be rigorously deal with accord to desert the instruction to these agent as well as a copy of the proclamation and report be herewith submit will be see by report of the of july last that have fully confirm the opinion express by general johnston in the|previous|october as to the necessity of send reenforcement to utah in this state that be firmly impressed with the belief that the presence of the army here and the large additional force that have be order to this territory be the chief inducement that cause the mormons to abandon the idea of resist the authority of the|united|state a less decisive policy would probably have result in a long bloody and expensive war these gentleman conduct to entire satisfaction and render useful service in execute the humane intention of the government also afford great satisfaction to state that governor cumming have perform duty in an able and conciliatory manner and with the happy effect can not in this connection refrain from mention the valuable service of colonel thomas|l.|kane who from motif of pure benevolence and without any official character or pecuniary compensation visit utah during the last inclement winter for the purpose of contribute to the pacification of the territory be happy to inform that the governor and other civil officer of utah be now perform appropriate function without resistance the authority of the constitution and the law have be fully restore and peace prevail throughout the territory a portion of the troop send to utah be now encamp in cedar|valley southwest of and the remainder have be order to oregon to suppress indian hostility the march of the army to salt|lake|city through the indianterritory have have a powerful effect in restrain the hostile feeling against the|united|state which exist among the indians in that region and in secure emigrant to the far west against depredation this will also be the mean of establish military post and promote settlement along the route recommend that the benefit of land law and preemption system be extend to the people of utah by the establishment of a land office in that territory have occasion also to congratulate on the result of negotiation with china be inform by last annual message that minister have be instruct to occupy a neutral position in the hostility conduct by great|britain and france against canton be however at the same time direct to cooperate cordially with the british and french minister in all peaceful measure to secure by treaty those just concession to foreign commerce which the nation of the world have a right to demand be impossible for to proceed further than this on own authority without usurp the war make power which under the constitution belong exclusively to congress besides after a careful examination of the nature and extent of grievance do not believe be of such a pressing and aggravated character as would have justify congress in declare war against the chinese empire without first make another earnest attempt to adjust by peaceful negotiation be the more inclined to this opinion because of the severe chastisement which have then but recently be inflict upon the chinese by squadron in the capture and destruction of the barrier fort to avenge an alleged insult to flag the event have prove the wisdom of neutrality minister have execute instruction with eminent skill and ability in conjunction with the russian plenipotentiary have peacefully but effectually cooperate with the english and french plenipotentiary and each of the power have conclude a separate treaty with china of a highly satisfactory character the treaty conclude by own plenipotentiary will immediately be submit to the senate be happy to announce that through the energetic yet conciliatory effort of consul general in japan a new treaty have be conclude with that empire which may be expect materially to augment trade and intercourse in that|quarter and remove from countryman the disability which have heretofore be impose upon the exercise of religion the treaty shall be submit to the senate for approval without delay be earnest desire that every misunderstanding with the|government|of|great|britain should be amicably and speedily adjust have be the misfortune of both country almost ever since the period of the revolution to have be annoy by a succession of irritate and dangerous question threaten friendly relation this have partially prevent the full development of those feeling of mutual friendship between the people of the country so natural in and so conducive to common interest any serious interruption of the commerce between the|united|state and great|britain would be equally injurious to both in fact no nation have ever exist on the face of the earth which could do each other so much good or so much harm entertain these sentiment be gratify to inform that the long pende controversy between the government in relation to the question of visitation and search have be amicably adjust the claim on the part of great|britain forcibly to visit american vessel on the high sea in time of peace could not be sustain under the law of nation and have be overrule by own most eminent jurist this question be recently bring to an issue by the repeat act of british cruiser in board and search merchant vessel in the|gulf|of|mexico and the adjacent sea these act be the more injurious and annoying as these water be traverse by a large portion of the commerce and navigation of the|united|state and free and unrestricted use be essential to the security of the coastwise trade between the different states of the union such vexatious interruption could not fail to excite the feeling of the country and to require the interposition of the government remonstrance be address to the|british|government against these violation of right of sovereignty and a naval force be at the same time order to the cuban water with direction to protect all vessel of the|united|state on the high sea from search or detention by the vessel of war of any other nation these measure receive the unqualified and even enthusiastic approbation of the american people most fortunately however no collision take place and the|british|government promptly avow recognition of the principle of international law upon this subject as lay down by in the note of the secretary of state to the british minister at washington of april|10,|1858 which secure the vessel of the|united|state upon the high sea from visitation or search in time of peace under any circumstance whatever the claim have be abandon in a manner reflect honor on the|british|government and evince a just regard for the law of nation and can not fail to strengthen the amicable relation between the country at the same time propose to the|united|state that some mode should be adopt by mutual arrangement between the country of a character which may be find effective without be offensive for verify the nationality of vessel suspect on good ground of carry false color have also invite the|united|state to take the initiative and propose measure for this purpose whilst decline to assume so grave a responsibility the secretary of state have inform the|british|government that be ready to receive any proposal which may feel disposed to offer have this object in view and to consider in an amicable spirit a strong opinion be however express that the occasional abuse of the flag of any nation be an evil far less to be deprecate than would be the establishment of any regulation which may be incompatible with the freedom of the sea this government have yet receive no communication specify the manner in which the|british|government would propose to carry out suggestion and be inclined to believe that no plan which can be devise will be free from grave embarrassment still shall form no decided opinion on the subject until shall have carefully and in the good spirit examine any proposal which may think proper to make be truly sorry can not also inform that the complication between great|britain and the|united|state arise out of the clayton and bulwer treaty of april,|1850 have be finally adjust at the commencement of last session have reason to hope that emancipate from further unavaile discussion the government would proceed to settle the central|american question in a practical manner alike honorable and satisfactory to both and this hope have not yet abandon in last|annual message state that overture have be make by the|british|government for this purpose in a friendly spirit which cordially reciprocate proposal be to withdraw these question from direct negotiation between the government but to accomplish the same object by a negotiation between the|british|government and each of the|central|american|republic whose territorial interest be immediately involve the settlement be to be make in accordance with the general tenor of the interpretation place upon the clayton and bulwer treaty by the|united|state with certain modification as negotiation be still pende upon this basis would not be proper for now to communicate present condition a final settlement of these question be greatly to be desire as this would wipe out the last remain subject of dispute between the country relation with the great empire of france and russia as well as with all other government on the continent of europe except that of spain continue to be of the most friendly character with spain relation remain in an unsatisfactory condition in message of december last inform that envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to madrid have ask for recall and be purpose to send out a new minister to that court with special instruction on all question pende between the government and with a determination to have speedily and amicably adjust if that be possible this purpose have be hitherto defeat by cause which need not enumerate the mission to spain have be intrust to a distinguished citizen of kentucky who will proceed to madrid without delay and make another and a final attempt to obtain justice from that government spanish official under the direct control of the captain general of cuba have insult national flag and in repeat instance have from time to time inflict injury on the person and property of citizen these have give birth to numerous claim against the|spanish|government the merit of which have be ably discuss for a|series|of|year by successive diplomatic representative notwithstanding this have not arrive at a practical result in any single instance unless may except the case of under the late administration and that present an outrage of such a character as would have justify an immediate resort to war all attempt to obtain redress have be baffle and defeat the frequent and oft recur change in the spanish ministry have be employ as reason for delay have be compel to wait again and again until the new minister shall have have time to investigate the justice of demand even what have be denominate the cuban claim in which more|than|100 of citizen be directly interested have furnish no exception these claim be for the refunding of duty unjustly exact from american vessel at different custom house in cuba so long ago as the|year|1844 the principle upon which rest be so manifestly equitable and just that after a period of nearly|ten|year in be recognize by the|spanish|government proceeding be afterwards institute to ascertain amount and this be finally fix accord to own statement with which be satisfied at the sum of just at the moment after a delay of fourteen|years when have reason to expect that this sum would be repay with interest have receive a proposal offer to refund third of that amount but without interest if would accept this in full satisfaction the offer be also accompany by a declaration that this indemnification be not found on any reason of strict justice but be make as a special favor allege cause for procrastination in the examination and adjustment of claim arise from an obstacle which be the duty of the|spanish|government to remove whilst the captain general of cuba be invest with general despotic authority in the government of that island the power be withhold from to examine and redress wrong commit by official under control on citizen of the|united|state instead of make complaint directly to at havana be oblige to present through minister at madrid these be then refer back to the captain general for information and much time be thus consume in preliminary investigation and correspondence between madrid and cuba before the|spanish|government will consent to proceed to negotiation many of the difficulty between the government would be obviate and a long train of negotiation avoid if the captain general be invest with authority to settle question of easy solution on the spot where all the fact be fresh and could be promptly and satisfactorily ascertain have hitherto in vain urge upon the|spanish|government to confer this power upon the captain general and minister to spain will again be instruct to urge this subject on notice in this respect occupy a different position from the power of europe cuba be almost within sight of shore commerce with be far great than that of any other nation include spain and citizen be in habit of daily and extend personal intercourse with every part of the island be therefore a great grievance that when any difficulty occur no matter how unimportant which may be readily settle at the moment should be oblige to resort to madrid especially when the very first step to be take there be to refer back to cuba the truth be that cuba in existing colonial condition be a constant source of injury and annoyance to the american people be the only spot in the civilized world where the african slave trade be tolerate and be bind by treaty with great|britain to maintain a naval force on the coast of africa at much expense both of life and treasure solely for the purpose of arrest slaver bind to that island the late serious difficulty between the|united|state and great|britain respect the right of search now so happily terminate could never have arise if cuba have not afford a market for slave as long as this market shall remain open there can be no hope for the civilization of benighted africa whilst the demand for slave continue in cuba war will be wag among the petty and barbarous chief in africa for the purpose of seize subject to supply this trade in such a condition of affair be impossible that the light of civilization and religion can ever penetrate these dark abode have be make known to the world by predecessor that the|united|states have on several occasion endeavor to acquire cuba from spain by honorable negotiation if this be accomplish the last relic of the african slave trade would instantly disappear would not if could acquire cuba in any other manner this be due to national character all the territory which have acquire since the origin of the government have be by fair purchase from france spain and mexico or by the free and voluntary act of the independent state of texas in blend destiny with own this course shall ever pursue unless circumstance should occur which do not now anticipate render a departure from clearly justifiable under the imperative and overrule law of self preservation the island of cuba from geographical position command the mouth of the mississippi and the immense and annually increase trade foreign and coastwise from the valley of that noble river now embrace half the sovereign states of the union with that island under the dominion of a distant foreign power this trade of vital importance to these states be expose to the danger of be destroy in time of war and have hitherto be subject to perpetual injury and annoyance in time of peace relation with spain which ought to be of the most friendly character must always be place in jeopardy whilst the exist colonial government over the island shall remain in present condition whilst the possession of the island would be of vast importance to the|united|state value to spain be comparatively unimportant such be the relative situation of the party when the great napoleon transfer louisiana to the|united|state jealous as ever be of the national honor and interest of france no person throughout the world have impute blame to for accept a pecuniary equivalent for this cession the publicity which have be give to former negotiation upon this subject and the large appropriation which may be require to effect the purpose render expedient before make another attempt to renew the negotiation that should lay the whole subject before congress this be especially necessary as may become indispensable to success that should be intrust with the mean of make an advance to the|spanish|government immediately after the signing of the treaty without await the ratification of by the senate be encourage to make this suggestion by the example of mr. jefferson previous to the purchase of louisiana from france and by that of mr. polk in view of the acquisition of territory from mexico refer the whole subject to congress and commend to careful consideration repeat the recommendation make in message of december last in favor of an appropriation to be pay to the|spanish|government for the purpose of distribution among the claimant in the amistad case president polk first make a similar recommendation in december,|1847 and be repeat by immediate predecessor in december entertain no doubt that indemnity be fairly due to these claimant under treaty with spain of october|27,|1795 and whilst demand justice ought to do justice an appropriation promptly make for this purpose could not fail to exert a favorable influence on negotiation with spain position in relation to the independent states south of on this continent and especially those within the limit of north|america be of a peculiar character the northern boundary of mexico be coincident with own southern boundary from ocean to ocean and must necessarily feel a deep interest in all that concern the well being and the fate of so near a neighbor have always cherish the kind wish for the success of that republic and have indulge the hope that may at last after all trial enjoy peace and prosperity under a free and stable government have never hitherto interfere directly or indirectly with internal affair and be a duty which owe to to protect the integrity of territory against the hostile interference of any other power geographical position direct interest in all that concern mexico and well settle policy in regard to the north|american continent render this an indispensable duty mexico have be in a state of constant revolution almost ever since achieve independence military leader after another have usurp the government in rapid succession and the various constitution from time to time adopt have be set at naught almost as soon as be proclaim the successive government have afford no adequate protection either to mexican citizen or foreign resident against lawless violence heretofore a seizure of the capital by a military chieftain have be generally follow by at least the nominal submission of the country to rule for a brief period but not so at the present crisis of mexican affair a civil war have be rage for some time throughout the republic between the central government at the|city|of|mexico which have endeavor to subvert the constitution last frame by military power and those who maintain the authority of that constitution the antagonist party each hold possession of different states of the republic and the fortune of the war be constantly change meanwhile the most reprehensible mean have be employ by both party to extort money from foreigner as well as native to carry on this ruinous contest the truth be that this fine country bless with a productive soil and a benign climate have be reduce by civil dissension to a condition of almost hopeless anarchy and imbecility would be vain for this government to attempt to enforce payment in money of the claim of american citizen now amount to more|than|$10,000,000 against mexico because be destitute of all pecuniary mean to satisfy these demand late minister be furnish with ample power and instruction for the adjustment of all pende question with the central government|of|mexico and perform duty with zeal and ability the claim of citizen some of arise out of the violation of an express provision of the treaty of guadalupe|hidalgo and other from gross injury to person as well as property have remain unredressed and even unnoticed remonstrance against these grievance have be address without effect to that government meantime in various part of the republic instance have be numerous of the murder imprisonment and plunder of citizen by different party claim and exercise a local jurisdiction but the central government although repeatedly urge thereto have make no effort either to punish the author of these outrage or to prevent recurrence no american citizen can now visit mexico on lawful business without imminent danger to person and property there be no adequate protection to either and in this respect treaty with that republic be almost a dead letter this state of affair be bring to a crisis in may last by the promulgation of a decree levy a contribution pro rata upon all the capital in the republic between certain specified amount whether hold by mexicans or foreigner mr. forsyth regard this decree in the light of a forced loan formally protest against application to countryman and advise not to pay the contribution but to suffer to be forcibly exact act upon this advice an american citizen refuse to pay the contribution and property be seize by armed man to satisfy the amount not content with this the government proceed still further and issue a decree banish from the country minister immediately notify that if this decree should be carry into execution would feel to be duty to adopt the most decided measure that belong to the power and obligation of the representative office notwithstanding this warning the banishment be enforce and mr. forsyth promptly announce to the government the suspension of the political relation of legation with until the pleasure of own government should be ascertain this government do not regard the contribution impose by the decree of the 15th may last to be in strictness a forced loan and as such prohibit by the tenth article of between great|britain and mexico to the benefit of which american citizen be entitle by treaty yet the imposition of the contribution upon foreigner be consider an unjust and oppressive measure besides internal faction in other part of the republic be at the same time levy similar exaction upon the property of citizen and interrupt commerce there have be an entire failure on the part of minister to secure redress for the wrong which citizen have endure notwithstanding persevere effort and from the temper manifest by the|mexican|government have repeatedly assure that no favorable change could be expect until the|united|state should give strike evidence of will and power to protect citizen and that severe chastening be the only earthly remedy for grievance from this statement of fact would have be bad than idle to direct mr. forsyth to retrace step and resume diplomatic relation with that government and be therefore deem proper to sanction withdrawal of the legation from the|city|of|mexico abundant cause now undoubtedly exist for a resort to hostility against the government still hold possession of the capital should succeed in subdue the constitutional force all reasonable hope will then have expire of a peaceful settlement of difficulty on the other hand should the constitutional party prevail and authority be establish over the republic there be reason to hope that will be animate by a less unfriendly spirit and may grant that redress to american citizen which justice require so far as may possess the mean but for this expectation should at once have recommend to congress to grant the necessary power to the president to take possession of a sufficient portion of the remote and unsettled territory of mexico to be hold in pledge until injury shall be redress and just demand be satisfied have already exhaust every milder mean of obtain justice in such a case this remedy of reprisal be recognize by the law of nation not only as just in but as a means of prevent actual war but there be another view of relation with mexico arise from the unhappy condition of affair along southwestern frontier which demand immediate action in that remote region where there be but few white inhabitant large band of hostile and predatory indians roam promiscuously over and sonora and adjoin territories the local government of these states be perfectly helpless and be keep in a state of constant alarm by the indians have not the power if possess the will even to restrain lawless mexicans from pass the border and commit depredation on remote settler a state of anarchy and violence prevail throughout that distant frontier the law be a dead letter and life and property wholly insecure for this reason the settlement of arizona be arrest whilst be of great importance that a chain of inhabitant should extend all along southern border sufficient for own protection and that of mail pass to and from california well found apprehension be now entertain that the indians and wander mexicans equally lawless may break up the important stage and postal communication recently establish between atlantic and pacific possession this pass very near to the mexican boundary throughout the whole length of arizona can imagine no possible remedy for these evil and no mode of restore law and order on that remote and unsettled frontier but for the|government|of|the|united|state to assume a temporary protectorate over the northern portion of chihuahua and sonora and to establish military post within the same and this earnestly recommend to congress this protection may be withdraw as soon as local government shall be establish in these mexican states capable of perform duty to the|united|state restrain the lawless and preserve peace along the border do not doubt that this measure will be view in a friendly spirit by the government and people of chihuahua and sonora as will prove equally effectual for the protection of citizen on that remote and lawless frontier as for citizen of the|united|state and in this connection permit to recall attention to the condition of arizona the population of that territory numbering as be allege more|than|10,000 soul be practically without a government without law and without any regular administration of justice murder and other crime be commit with impunity this state of thing call loudly for redress and therefore repeat recommendation for the establishment of a territorial government over arizona the political condition of the narrow isthmus of central|america through which transit route pass between the atlantic and pacific ocean present a subject of deep interest to all commercial nation be over these transit that a large proportion of the trade and travel between the european and asiatic continent be destine to pass to the|united|stat these route be of incalculable importance as a means of communication between atlantic and pacific possession the latter now extend throughout seventeen|degree of latitude on the|pacific|coast embrace the important state of california and the flourish territory of oregon and washington all commercial nation therefore have a deep and direct interest that these communication shall be render secure from interruption if an arm of the sea connect the ocean penetrate through nicaragua and costa|rica could not be pretend that these states would have the right to arrest or retard navigation to the injury of other nation the transit by land over this narrow isthmus occupy nearly the same position be a highway in which have little interest when compare with the vast interest of the rest of the world whilst right of sovereignty ought to be respect be the duty of other nation to require that this important passage shall not be interrupt by the civil war and revolutionary outbreak which have so frequently occur in that region the stake be too important to be leave at the mercy of rival company claim to hold conflict contract with nicaragua the commerce of other nation be not to stand still and await the adjustment of such petty controversy the|government|of the|united|state expect no more than this and will not be satisfied with less would not if could derive any advantage from the nicaragua transit not common to the rest of the world neutrality and protection for the common use of all nation be only object have no objection that nicaragua shall demand and receive a fair compensation from the company and individual who may traverse the route but insist that shall never hereafter be close by an arbitrary decree of that government if dispute arise between and those with whom may have enter into contract these must be adjust by some fair tribunal provide for the purpose and the route must not be close pende the controversy this be whole policy and can not fail to be acceptable to other nation all these difficulty may be avoid if consistently with the good faith of nicaragua the use of this transit could be throw open to general competition provide at the same time for the payment of a reasonable rate to the|nicaraguan|government on passenger and freight in august,|1852 the|accessory|transit|company make first interoceanic trip over the nicaraguan route and continue in successful operation with great advantage to the public until when be close and the grant to this company as well as charter be summarily and arbitrarily revoke by the government of president rivas previous to this date however in serious dispute concern the settlement of account have arise between the company and the government threaten the interruption of the route at any moment these the|united|state in vain endeavor to compose would be useless to narrate the various proceeding which take place between the party up till the time when the transit be discontinue suffice to say that since february,|1856 have remain closed greatly to the prejudice of citizen of the|united|state since that time the competition have cease between the rival route of panama and nicaragua and in consequence thereof an unjust and unreasonable amount have be exact from citizen for passage to and from california a treaty be sign on the|16th|day|of|november,|1857 by the secretary of state and minister of nicaragua under the stipulation of which the use and protection of the transit route would have be secure not only to the|united|state but equally to all other nation how and on what pretext this treaty have fail to receive the ratification of the|nicaraguan|government will appear by the paper herewith communicate from the|state|department the principal objection seem to have be to the provision authorize the|united|state to employ force to keep the route open in case nicaragua should fail to perform duty in this respect from the feebleness of that republic frequent change of government and constant internal dissension this have become a most important stipulation and essentially necessary not only for the security of the route but for the safety of american citizen pass and repasse to and from pacific possession be such a stipulation embrace in a treaty between the|united|state and nicaragua the knowledge of this fact would of most probably prevent hostile party from commit aggression on the route and render actual interference for protection unnecessary the executive government of this country in intercourse with foreign nation be limit to the employment of diplomacy alone when this fail can proceed no further can not legitimately resort to force without the direct authority of congress except in resist and repel hostile attack would have no authority to enter the territory of nicaragua even to prevent the destruction of the transit and protect the life and property of own citizen on passage be true that on a sudden emergency of this character the president would direct any armed force in the vicinity to march to relief but in do this would act upon own responsibility under these circumstance earnestly recommend to congress the passage of an act authorize the president under such restriction as may deem proper to employ the land and naval force of the|united|state in prevent the transit from be obstruct or close by lawless violence and in protect the life and property of american citizen travel thereupon require at the same time that these force shall be withdraw the moment the danger shall have pass away without such a provision citizen will be constantly expose to interruption in progress and to lawless violence a similar necessity exist for the passage of such an act for the protection of the panama and tehuantepec route in reference to the panama route the|united|state by exist treaty with new|granada expressly guarantee the neutrality of the isthmus with the view that the free transit from the one to the other sea may not be interrupt or embarrass in any future time while this treaty exist in regard to the tehuantepec route which have be recently open under the most favorable auspex treaty with mexico of the|30th|december,|1853 secure to the citizen of the|united|state a right of transit over for person and merchandise and stipulate that neither government shall interpose any obstacle thereto also concede to the|united|state the right to transport across the isthmus in closed bag the mail of the|united|state not intend for distribution along the line of the communication also the effect of the|united|states|government and citizen which may be intend for transit and not for distribution on the isthmus free of custom house or other charge by the|mexican|government these treaty stipulation with new|granada and mexico in addition to the consideration applicable to the nicaragua route seem to require legislation for the purpose of carry into effect the injury which have be inflict upon citizen in costa|rica and nicaragua during the|last|two|or|three|year have receive the prompt attention of this government some of these injury be of the most aggravated character the transaction at virgin|bay in april,|1856 when a company of unarmed americans who be in no way connect with any belligerent conduct or party be fire upon by the troop of costa|rica and number of kill and wound be bring to the knowledge of congress by predecessor soon after occurrence and be also present to the government|of|costa|rica for that immediate investigation and redress which the nature of the case demand a similar course be pursue with reference to other outrage in these country some of which be hardly less aggravated in character than the transaction at virgin|bay at the time however when present minister to nicaragua be appoint in december,|1857 no redress have be obtain for any of these wrong and no reply even have be receive to the demand which have be make by this government upon that of costa|rica minister be instruct therefore to lose no time in express to those government the deep regret with which the president have witness this inattention to the just claim of the|united|state and in demand prompt and satisfactory adjustment unless this demand shall be comply with at an early day will only remain for this government to adopt such other measure as may be necessary in order to obtain for that justice which have in vain attempt to secure by peaceful mean from the government of nicaragua and costa|rica while have show and will continue to show the most sincere regard for the right and honor of these republics can not permit this regard to be meet by an utter neglect on part of what be due to the government and citizen of the|united|state against|new|granada have long stand cause of complaint arise out of the unsatisfied claim of citizen upon that republic and to these have be more recently add the outrage commit upon citizen at panama in april,|1856 a treaty for the adjustment of these difficulty be conclude by the secretary of state and the minister of new|granada in september,|1857 which contain just and acceptable provision for that purpose this treaty be transmit to bogota and be ratify by the|government|of|new|granada but with certain amendment be not however return to this city until after the close of the last session of the senate will be immediately transmit to that body for advice and consent and should this be obtain will remove all exist cause of complaint against new|granada on the subject of claim question have arise between the government as to the right of new|granada to levy a tonnage duty upon the vessel of the|united|state in port of the isthmus and to levy a passenger tax upon citizen arrive in that country whether with a design to remain there or to pass from ocean to ocean by the transit route and also a tax upon the mail of the|united|state transport over the|panama|railroad the government of new granada have be inform that the|united|states would consider the collection of either of these taxis as an act in violation of the treaty between the country and as such would be resist by the|united|state at the same time be prepared to discuss these question in a spirit of amity and justice and with a sincere desire to adjust in a satisfactory manner a negotiation for that purpose have already be commence no effort have recently be make to collect these taxis nor be any anticipate under present circumstance with the|empire|of|brazil relation be of the most friendly character the production of the country and especially those of an agricultural nature be such as to invite extensive mutual exchange a large quantity of american flour be consume in brazil whilst more than treble the amount in value of brazilian coffee be consume in the|united|state whilst this be the case a heavy duty have be levy until very recently upon the importation of american flour into brazil be gratify however to be able to inform that in september last this have be reduce from to about|49|cent per barrel and the duty on other article of production have be diminish in nearly the same proportion regret to state that the|government|of|brazil still continue to levy an export duty of about|11|per|cent on coffee notwithstanding this article be admit free from duty in the|united|state this be a heavy charge upon the consumer of coffee in country as purchase half of the entire surplus crop of that article raise in brazil minister under instruction will reiterate effort to have this export duty remove and be hope that the enlighten government|of|the|emperor will adopt this wise just and equal policy in that event there be good reason to believe that the commerce between the country will greatly increase much to the advantage of both the claim of citizen against the|government|of|brazil be not in the aggregate of very large amount but some of these rest upon plain principle of justice and settlement ought not to be longer delay a renewed and earnest and trust a successful effort will be make by minister to procure final adjustment on the of june last congress pass a joint resolution authorize the president to adopt such measure and use such force as in judgment may be necessary and advisable for the the purpose of the difference between the|united|state and the|republic|of|paraguay in connection with the attack on steamer water|witch and with other measure refer to in annual message and on follow make an appropriation to defray the expense and compensation of a commissioner to that republic should the president deem proper to make such all appointment in compliance with these enactment have appoint a commissioner who have proceed to paraguay with full power and instruction to settle these difference in an amicable and peaceful manner if this be practicable experience and discretion justify the hope that may prove successful in convince the|paraguayan|government that be due both to honor and justice that should voluntarily and promptly make atonement for the wrong which have commit against the|united|state and indemnify injure citizen whom have forcibly despoil of property should commissioner prove unsuccessful after a sincere and earnest effort to accomplish the object of mission then no alternative will remain but the employment of force to obtain just satisfaction from paraguay in view of this contingency the secretary of the navy under direction have fit out and dispatch a naval force to rendezvous near buenos|ayre which be believe will prove sufficient for the occasion be earnest desire however that may not be find necessary to resort to this last alternative when congress meet in december last the business of the country have just be crush by of those periodical revulsion which be the inevitable consequence of unsound and extravagant system of bank credit and inflated currency with all the element of national wealth in abundance manufacture be suspend useful public and private enterprise be arrest and thousand of laborer be deprive of employment and reduce to want universal distress prevail among the commercial manufacturing and mechanical class this revulsion be feel the more severely in the|united|state because similar cause have produce the like deplorable effect throughout the commercial nation of europe all be experience sad revers at the same moment manufacturer everywhere suffer severely not because of the recent reduction in the tariff of duty on import but because there be no demand at any price for production the people be oblige to restrict in purchase to article of prime necessity in the general prostration of business the iron manufacturer in different states probably suffer more than any other class and much destitution be the inevitable consequence among the great number of workman who have be employ in this useful branch of industry there could be no supply where there be no demand to present an example there could be no demand for railroad iron after magnificent system of railroad extend benefit to every portion of the union have be bring to a dead pause the same consequence have result from similar cause to many other branch of useful manufacture be self evident that where there be no ability to purchase manufacture article these can not be sell and consequently must cease to be produce no government and especially a government of such limited power as that of the|united|state could have prevent the late revulsion the whole commercial world seem for year to have be rush to this catastrophe the same ruinous consequence would have follow in the|united|state whether the duty upon foreign import have remain as be under the tariff of or have be raise to a much high standard the tariff of have no agency in the result the general cause exist throughout the world could not have be control by the legislation of any particular country the periodical revulsion which have exist in past history must continue to return at interval so long as present unbounded system of bank credit shall prevail will however probably be the less severe in future because be not to be expect at least for many|year to come that the commercial nation of europe with whose interest own be so materially involve will expose to similar calamity but this subject be treat so much at large in last|annual message that shall not now pursue further still respectfully renew the recommendation in favor of the passage of a uniform bankrupt law applicable to banking institution this be all the direct power over the subject which believe the|federal|government possess such a law would mitigate though may not prevent the evil the instinct of self preservation may produce a wholesome restraint upon banking business if know in advance that a suspension of specie payment would inevitably produce civil death but the effect of the revulsion be now slowly but surely pass away the energy and enterprise of citizen with unbounded resource will within the|period|of|another|year restore a state of wholesome industry and trade capital have again accumulate in large city the rate of interest be there very low confidence be gradually revive and so soon as be discover that this capital can be profitably employ in commercial and manufacturing enterprise and in the construction of railroad and other work of public and private improvement prosperity will again smile throughout the land be vain however to disguise the fact from that a speculative inflation of currency without a corresponding inflation in other country whose manufacture come into competition with own must ever produce disastrous result to domestic manufacture no tariff short of absolute prohibition can prevent these evil consequence in connection with this subject be proper to refer to financial condition the same cause which have produce pecuniary distress throughout the country have so reduce the amount of import from foreign country that the revenue have prove inadequate to meet the necessary expense of the government to supply the deficiency congress by the act of december|23,|1857 authorize the issue of of treasury note and this proving inadequate authorize by the act of june|14,|1858 a loan of to be apply to the payment of appropriation make by law no statesman would advise that should go on increase the national debt to meet the ordinary expense of the government this would be a most ruinous policy in case of war credit must be chief resource at least for the|first|year and this would be greatly impair by have contract a large debt in time of peace be true policy to increase revenue so as to equal expenditure would be ruinous to continue to borrow besides may be proper to observe that the incidental protection thus afford by a revenue tariff would at the present moment to some extent increase the confidence of the manufacturing interest and give a fresh impulse to revive business to this surely no person will object in regard to the mode of assess and collect duty under a strictly revenue tariff have long entertain and often express the opinion that sound policy require this should be do by specific duty in case to which these can be properly apply be well adapt to commodity which be usually sell by weight or by measure and which from nature be of equal or of nearly equal value such for example be the article of iron of different class raw sugar and foreign wine and spirit in deliberate judgment specific duty be the good if not the only mean of secure the revenue against false and fraudulent invoice and such have be the practice adopt for this purpose by other commercial nation besides specific duty would afford to the american manufacturer the incidental advantage to which be fairly entitle under a revenue tariff the present system be a slide scale to disadvantage under when price be high and business prosperous the duty rise in amount when least require aid on the contrary when price fall and be struggle against adversity the duty be diminish in the same proportion greatly to injury neither would there be danger that a high rate of duty than that intend by congress could be levy in the form of specific duty would be easy to ascertain the average value of any import article for a|series|of|years and instead of subject to an ad valorem duty at a certain rate per centum to substitute in place an equivalent specific duty by such an arrangement the consumer would not be injure be true may have to pay a little more duty on a give article in one|year but if so would pay a little less in another and in a|series|of|years these would counterbalance each other and amount to the same thing so far as interest be concern this inconvenience would be trifle when contrast with the additional security thus afford against fraud upon the revenue in which every consumer be directly interested have throw out these suggestion as the fruit of own observation to which congress in well judgment will give such weight as may justly deserve the report of the secretary of the treasury will explain in detail the operation of that department|of|the|government the receipt into the treasury from all source during include the treasury note authorize by the act of december|23,|1857 be which amount with the balance of remain in the treasury at the commencement of the|year make an aggregate for the service of the|year of the public expenditure during amount to of which be apply to the payment of the public debt and the redemption of treasury note with the interest thereon leave in the treasury on july|1,|1858 be the commencement of the receipt into the treasury during the|first|quarter of commence the|1st|of|july,|1858 include half of the loan of with the premium upon authorize by the act of june|14,|1858 be and the estimate receipt for the remain three|quarters|to|the|30th|of|june,|1859 from ordinary source be make with the balance before state an aggregate of the expenditure during the|first|quarter of be of which be apply to the payment of the public debt and the redemption of treasury note and the interest thereon the estimate expenditure during the remain three|quarters|to|june|30,|1859 be make an aggregate of be an excess of expenditure beyond the estimate receipt into the treasury from ordinary source during the|fiscal|year|to|the|30th|of|june,|1859 of extraordinary mean be place by law within the command of the secretary of the treasury by the reissue of treasury note redeem and by negotiate the balance of the loan authorize by the act of june|14,|1858 to the extent of which if realize during the|present|fiscal|year will leave a balance in the treasury on the|1st|day|of|july,|1859 of the estimate receipt during the|next|fiscal|year end june|30,|1860 be which with the above estimate balance of make an aggregate for the service of the|next|fiscal|year of the estimate expenditure during the|next|fiscal|year end june|30,|1860 be which leave a deficit of estimate mean compare with the estimate expenditure for that|year commence on july|1,|1859 of in addition to this sum the|postmaster general will require from the treasury for the service of the|post office|department as explain in the report of the secretary of the treasury which will increase the estimate deficit on june|30,|1860 to 7,914,576.89 to provide for the payment of this estimate deficiency which will be increase by such appropriation as may be make by congress not estimate for in the report of the|treasury|department as well as to provide for the gradual redemption from year|to|year of the outstanding treasury note the secretary of the treasury recommend such a revision of the present tariff as will raise the require amount after what have already say need scarcely add that concur in the opinion express in report that the public debt should not be increase by an additional loan and would therefore strongly urge upon congress the duty of make at present session the necessary provision for meet these liability the public debt on july|1,|1858 the commencement of the|present|fiscal|year be during the|first|quarter|of|the|present|year the sum of have be negotiate of the loan authorize by the act of june|14,|1858 make the present outstanding public debt exclusive of treasury note there be on the|1st|of|july,|1858 of treasury note issue by authority of the act of december|23,|1857 unredeemed the sum of make the amount of actual indebtedness at that date to this will be add during the|present|fiscal|year this be the remain half of the loan of not yet negotiate the rapid increase of the public debt and the necessity which exist for a modification of the tariff to meet even the ordinary expense of the government ought to admonish all in respective sphere of duty to the practice of rigid economy the object of expenditure should be limit in number as far as this may be practicable and the appropriation necessary to carry into effect ought to be disburse under the strict accountability enlighten economy do not consist in the refusal to appropriate money for constitutional purpose essential to the defense progress and prosperity of the republic but in take care that none of this money shall be waste by mismanagement in application to the object designate by law comparison between the annual expenditure at the present time and what be ten|or|twenty|years|ago be altogether fallacious the rapid increase of country in extent and population render a corresponding increase of expenditure to some extent unavoidable this be constantly create new object of expenditure and augment the amount require for the old the true question then be have these object be unnecessarily multiply or have the amount expend upon any or all of be large than comport with due economy in accordance with these principle the head of the different executive departments of the government have be instruct to reduce estimate for the|next|fiscal|year to the low standard consistent with the efficiency of the service and this duty have perform in a spirit of just economy the estimate of the treasury war navy and interior|department have each be in some degree reduce and unless a sudden and unforeseen emergency should arise be not anticipate that a deficiency will exist in either within the present or the|next|fiscal|year the|post office|department be place in a peculiar position different from the other departments and to this shall hereafter refer invite congress to institute a rigid scrutiny to ascertain whether the expense in all the departments can not be still further reduce and promise all the aid in power in pursue the investigation transmit herewith the report make to by the|secretaries|of|war of the navy of the interior and of the|postmaster general each contain valuable information and important recommendation to which invite the attention of congress in last annual message take occasion to recommend the immediate construction of small steamer of light draft for the purpose of increase the efficiency of the navy congress respond to the recommendation by authorize the construction of of the progress which have be make in execute this authority be state in the report of the secretary of the navy concur with in the opinion that a great number of this class of vessel be necessary for the purpose of protect in a more efficient manner the person and property of american citizen on the high sea and in foreign country as well as in guard more effectually own coast accordingly recommend the passage of an act for this purpose the suggestion contain in the report of the secretary of the interior especially those in regard to the disposition of the public domain the pension and bounty land system the policy toward the indians and the amendment of patent law be worthy of the serious consideration of congress office|department occupy a position very different from that of the other departments for many|years be the policy of the government to render this a self sustain department and if this can not now be accomplish in the present condition of the country ought to make as near an approach to as may be practicable general be place in a most embarrassing position by the exist law be oblige to carry these into effect have no other alternative find however that this can not be do without heavy demand upon the treasury over and above what be receive for postage and these have be progressively increase from year to year until amount for the|last|fiscal|year end on the|30th|of|june,|1858 to more|than|$4,500,000 whilst be estimate that for the|present|fiscal|year will amount to these sum be exclusive of the annual appropriation of for compensation for the mail service perform for the houses|of|congress and the other departments and officer of the government in the transmission of free matter the cause of these large deficit be mainly attributable to the increase expense of transport the mail in the sum pay for this service be but a|fraction|above|four|millions|and|a|quarter since that|year have annually increase until in have reach more|than|eight|millions|and|a|quarter and for the service of be estimate that will amount to more|than|$10,000,000 the receipt of the|post office|department can be make to approach or to equal expenditure only by mean of the legislation of congress in apply any remedy care should be take that the people shall not be deprive of the advantage which be fairly entitle to enjoy from the|post office|department the principal remedy recommend to the consideration of congress by the|postmaster general be to restore the former rate of postage upon single letter to to substitute for the franking privilege the delivery to those now entitled to enjoy of post - office stamp for correspondence and to direct the department in make contract for the transportation of the mail to confine to the payment of the sum necessary for this single purpose without require to be transport in post coach or carriage of any particular description under the present system the expense to the government be greatly increase by require that the mail shall be carry in such vehicle as will accommodate passenger this will be do without pay from the department over all road where the travel will remunerate the contractor these recommendation deserve the grave consideration of congress would again call attention to the construction of a pacific railroad time and reflection have but serve to confirm in the truth and justice of the observation which make on this subject in last|annual message to which beg leave respectfully to refer be freely admit that would be inexpedient for this government to exercise the power of construct the pacific railroad by own immediate agent such a policy would increase the patronage of the executive to a dangerous extent and introduce a system of jobbing and corruption which no vigilance on the part of federal official could either prevent or detect this can only be do by the keen eye and active and careful supervision of individual and private interest the construction of this road ought therefore to be commit to company incorporate by the states or other agency whose pecuniary interest would be directly involve congress may then assist in the work by grant of land or of money or both under such condition and restriction as would secure the transportation of troop and munition of war free from any charge and that of mail at a fair and reasonable price the progress of event since the commencement of last session have show how soon difficulty disappear before a firm and determined resolution at that time such a road be deem by wise and patriotic man to be a visionary project the great distance to be overcome and the intervene mountain and desert in the way be obstacle which in the opinion of many could not be surmount now after the lapse of but a|single|year these obstacle have be discover be far less formidable than be suppose to be and mail stage with passenger now pass and repass regularly twice in each|week by a common wagon road between san|francisco and st.|louis and memphis in less than five|day the service have be as regularly perform as be in former|years between new|york and this city whilst disclaim all authority to appropriate money for the construction of this road except that derive from the war make power of the constitution there be important collateral consideration urge to undertake the work as speedily as possible the first and most momentous of these be that such a road would be a powerful bond of union between the states east and west of the|rocky|mountain this be so self evident as to require no illustration but again in a commercial point of view consider this the great question of the|day with the eastern front of republic stretch along the atlantic and western front along the pacific if all the part should be unite by a safe easy and rapid intercommunication must necessarily command a very large proportion of the trade both of europe and asia recent treaty with china and japan will open these rich and populous empire to commerce and the history of the world prove that the nation which have gain possession of the trade with eastern asia have always become wealthy and powerful the peculiar geographical position of california and pacific possession invite american capital and enterprise into this fruitful field to reap the rich harvest however be an indispensable prerequisite that shall first have a railroad to convey and circulate product throughout every portion of the union besides such a railroad through temperate latitude which would not be impede by the frost and snow of winter nor by the tropical heat of summer would attract to much of the travel and the trade of all nation pass between europe and asia on the|21st|of|august last lieutenant j.|n.|maffit of the united|states brig dolphin capture the slaver echo formerly the putnam of new|orleans near kay|verde on the coast of cuba with more|than|300 african negro on board the prize under the command of lieutenant|bradford of the|united|states|navy arrive at charleston on the|27th|august when the negro in number be deliver into the custody of the|united|state marshal for the district of south|carolina be first place in castle|pinckney and afterwards in fort|sumter for safe keeping and be detain there until the|19th|september when the survivor in number be deliver on board steamer niagara to be transport to the coast of africa under the charge of the agent of the|united|state pursuant to the provision of the act of the march,|1819 in addition to the act prohibit the slave trade under the second section of this act the president be authorize to make such regulation and arrangement as may deem expedient for the safe keeping support and removal beyond the limit of the|united|state of all such negro mulatto or person of color capture by vessel of the|united|state as may be deliver to the marshal of the district into which be bring and to appoint a proper person or person reside upon the coast of africa as agent or agent for receive the negro mulatto or person of color deliver from on board vessel seize in the prosecution of the slave trade by commander of united|states armed vessel a doubt immediately arise as to the true construction of this act be quite clear from term that the president be authorize to provide for the safe keeping support and removal of these negro up till the time of delivery to the agent on the coast of africa but no express provision be make for protection and support after have reach the place of destination still an agent be to be point to receive in africa and could not have be suppose that congress intend should desert at the moment be receive and turn loose on that inhospitable coast to perish for want of food or to become again the victim of the slave trade have this be the intention of congress the employment of an agent to receive who be require to reside on the coast be unnecessary and may have be land by vessel anywhere in africa and leave expose to the suffering and the fate which would certainly await mr. monroe in special message of december|17,|1819 at the first session after the act be pass announce to congress what in opinion be true construction believe to be duty under to follow these unfortunate into africa and make provision for there until should be able to provide for in communicate this interpretation of the act to congress state that some doubt have be entertain as to true intent and meaning and submit the question to so that may should be deem advisable amend the same before further proceeding be have under nothing be do by congress to explain the act and mr. monroe proceed to carry into execution accord to own interpretation this then become the practical construction when the africans from on board the echo be deliver to the marshal at charleston become duty to consider what disposition ought to be make of under the law for many reason be expedient to remove from that locality as speedily as possible although the conduct of the authority and citizen of charleston in give countenance to the execution of the law be just what may have be expect from high character yet a prolong continuance of africans in the immediate vicinity of that city could not have fail to become a source of inconvenience and anxiety to inhabitant where to send be the question there be no portion of the coast of africa to which could be remove with any regard to humanity except to liberia under these circumstance an agreement be enter into with the|colonization|society on the|7th|of|september|last a copy of which be herewith transmit under which the society engage for the consideration of to receive these africans in liberia from the agent of the|united|state and furnish during the period of one|year thereafter with comfortable shelter clothing provision and medical attendance cause the child to receive schooling and all whether child or adult to be instruct in the art of civilized life suitable to condition this aggregate of be base upon an allowance of for each individual and as there have be considerable mortality among and may be more before reach africa the society have agree in an equitable spirit to make such a deduction from the amount as under the circumstance may appear just and reasonable this can not be fix until shall ascertain the actual number which may become a charge to the society be also distinctly agree that under no circumstance shall this government be call upon for any additional expense the agent of the society manifest a laudable desire to conform to the wish of the government throughout the transaction assure that after a careful calculation would be require to expend the sum of on each individual in comply with the agreement and would have nothing leave to remunerate for care trouble and responsibility at all event could make no well arrangement and there be no other alternative during the period when the government through own agent undertake the task of provide for capture negro in africa the cost per head be very much great there have be no outstanding appropriation applicable to this purpose could not advance any money on the agreement therefore recommend that an appropriation may be make of the amount necessary to carry into effect other capture of a similar character may and probably will be make by naval force and earnestly recommend that congress may amend the second section of so as to free construction from the ambiguity which have so long exist and render the duty of the president plain in execute provision recommend to favorable regard the local interest of as the residence of congress and the|executive|departments|of|the|government can not fail to feel a deep concern in welfare this be heighten by the high character and the peaceful and orderly conduct of resident inhabitant can not conclude without perform the agreeable duty of express gratification that congress so kindly respond to the recommendation of last|annual message by afford sufficient time before the close of late session for the examination of all the bill present to for approval this change in the practice of congress have prove to be a wholesome reform exert a beneficial influence on the transaction of legislative business and elicit the general approbation of the country enable congress to adjourn with that dignity and deliberation so become to the representative of this great republic without have crowd into general appropriation bill provision foreign to nature and of doubtful constitutionality and expediency let warmly and strongly commend this precedent establish by as a guide to proceeding during the present session transcript mr. president and gentlemen|of|the|convention if could first know where be and whither be tend could then better judge what to do and how to do be now far into the|fifth|year since a policy be initiate with the avow object and confident promise of put an end to slavery agitation under the operation of that policy that agitation have not only not cease but have constantly augment in opinion will not cease until a crisis shall have be reach and pass a house divide against can not stand believe this government can not endure permanently half slave and half free do not expect the union to be dissolve do not expect the house to fall but do expect will cease to be divide will become all thing or all the other either the opponent of slavery will arrest the further spread of and place where the public mind shall rest in the belief that be in course of ultimate extinction or advocate will push forward till shall become alike lawful in all the states old as well as new north as well as south have no tendency to the latter condition let any one who doubt carefully contemplate that now almost complete legal combination piece of machinery so to speak compound of the nebraska doctrine and the dred|scott decision let consider not only what work the machinery be adapt to do and how well adapted but also let study the history of construction and trace if can or rather fail if can to trace the evidence of design and concert of action among chief boss from the beginning but so far congress only have act and an indorsement by the people real or apparent be indispensable to save the point already gain and give chance for more the|new|year|of|1854 find slavery exclude from more|than|half the states by state|constitution and from most of the national territory by congressional prohibition four|days|later commence the struggle which end in repeal that congressional prohibition this open all the national territory to slavery and be the first point gain this necessity have not be overlook but have be provide for as well as may be in the notable argument of squatter sovereignty otherwise call sacred right of self government which latter phrase though expressive of the only rightful basis of any government be so perverted in this attempt use of as to amount to just this that if any man choose to enslave another no third man shall be allow to object that argument be incorporate into the nebraska bill in the language which follow be the true intent and meaning of this act not to legislate slavery into any territory or state not exclude therefrom but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate domestic institution in own way subject only to the|united|state then open the roar of loose declamation in favor of and sacred right of self government but say opposition member let be more specific let amend the bill so as to expressly declare that the people of the territory may exclude slavery not say the friend of the measure and down vote the amendment while the nebraska bill be pass through congress a law case involve the question of a negroe 's freedom by reason of owner have voluntarily take first into a free state and then a territory cover by the congressional prohibition and hold as a slave for a long time in each be pass through the|u.s.|circuit|court for and both nebraska bill and law suit be bring to a decision in the|same|month|of|may,|1854 the negroe 's name be dred|scott which name now designate the decision finally make in the case before the then next presidential election the law case come to and be argue in the|supreme|court of the|united|state but the decision of be defer until after the election still before the election senator trumbull on the floor of the senate request the lead advocate of the nebraska bill to state opinion whether the people of a territory can constitutionally exclude slavery from limit and the latter answer that be a question for the|supreme|court the election come mr. buchanan be elect and the indorsement such as be secure that be the second point gain the indorsement however fall short of a clear popular majority by nearly|four|hundred|thousand vote and so perhaps be not overwhelmingly reliable and satisfactory the outgoing president in last annual message as impressively as possible echo back upon the people the weight and authority of the indorsement the|supreme|court meet again do not announce decision but order a re - argument the presidential inauguration come and still no decision of the court but the incoming president in inaugural address fervently exhort the people to abide by the forthcoming decision whatever may be then in a|few|day come the decision the repute author of the nebraska bill find an early occasion to make a speech at this capitol indorse the|dred|scott|decision and vehemently denounce all opposition to the new president too seize the early occasion of the silliman letter to indorse and strongly construe that decision and to express astonishment that any different view have ever be entertain at length a squabble spring up between the president and the author of the nebraska bill on the mere question of fact whether the lecompton constitution be or be not in any just sense make by the people of kansas and in that squabble the latter declare that all want be a fair vote for the people and that care not whether slavery be vote down or vote up do not understand declaration that care not whether slavery be vote down or vote up to be intend by other than as an apt definition of the policy would impress upon the public mind the principle for which declare have suffer much and be ready to suffer to the end and well may cling to that principle if have any parental feeling well may cling to that principle be the only shre left of original nebraska doctrine under the dred scott decision squatter sovereignty squat out of existence tumble down like temporary scaffolding like the mould at the foundry serve through blast and fall back into loose sand help to carry an election and then be kick to the wind late joint struggle with the republicans against the|lecompton|constitution involve nothing of the original nebraska doctrine that struggle be make on a point the right of a people to make own constitution upon which and the republicans have never differ the several point of the dred|scott decision in connection with senator douglas care not policy constitute the piece of machinery in present state of advancement this be the third point gain the work point of that machinery be first that no negro slave import as such from africa and no descendant of such slave can ever be a citizen of any state in the sense of that term as use in the|united|state this point be make in order to deprive the negro in every possible event of the benefit of this provision of the|united|states|constitution which declare the citizen of each state shall be entitle to all privilege and immunity of citizen in the several states secondly that subject to the|united|state neither congress nor a territorial|legislature can exclude slavery from any united|states territory this point be make in order that individual man may fill up the territory with slave without danger of lose as property and thus to enhance the chance of permanency to the institution through all the future thirdly that whether the hold a negro in actual slavery in a free state make free as against the holder the|united|state court will not decide but will leave to be decide by the court of any slave state the negro may be force into by the master this point be make not to be press immediately but if acquiesce in for a while and apparently indorse by the people at an election then to sustain the logical conclusion that what dred|scott 's master may lawfully do with dred|scott in the free state|of|illinois every other master may lawfully do with any other one or one|thousand slave in illinois or in any other free state auxiliary to all this and work hand in hand with the nebraska doctrine or what be leave of be to educate and mould public opinion at least northern public opinion to not care whether slavery be vote down or vote up this show exactly where now be and partially also whither be tend will throw additional light on the latter to go back and run the mind over the string of historical fact already state several thing will now appear less dark and mysterious than do when be transpire the people be to be leave perfectly free subject only to the constitution what the constitution have to do with outsider could not then see plainly enough now be an exactly fit niche for the dred|scott decision to afterwards come in and declare the perfect freedom of the people to be just no freedom at all why be the amendment expressly declare the right of the people to exclude slavery vote down plainly enough now the adoption of would have spoil the niche for the dred scott decision why be the court decision hold up why even a senator 's individual opinion withhold till after the presidential election plainly enough now the speak out then would have damage the perfectly free argument upon which the election be to be carry why the outgoing president 's felicitation on the indorsement why the delay of a reargument why the incoming president 's advance exhortation in favor of the decision these thing look like the cautious patting and pet a spirited horse preparatory to mount when be dread that may give the rider a fall and why the hasty after indorsement of the decision by the president and other can not absolutely know that all these exact adaptation be the result of preconcert but when see a lot of frame timber different portion of which know have be get out at different time and place and by different workman stephen franklin roger and james for instance and when see these timber join together and see exactly make the frame of a house or a mill all the tenon and mortice exactly fit and all the length and proportion of the different piece exactly adapt to respective place and not a piece too many or too few not omit even scaffold or if a single piece be lack can see the place in the frame exactly fit and prepare to yet bring such piece in in such a case find impossible to not believe that stephen and franklin and roger and james all understand another from the beginning and all work upon a common plan or draft draw up before the first lick be strike should not be overlook that by the nebraska bill the people of a state as well as territory be to be leave perfectly free subject only to the constitution why mention a state be legislate for territory and not for or about|state certainly the people of a state be and ought to be subject to the|united|state but why be mention of this lug into this merely territorial law why be the people of a territory and the people of a state therein lump together and relation to the constitution therein treat as be precisely the same while the opinion of the court by chief justice taney in the dred scott case and the separate opinion of all the concur judges expressly declare that the|united|state neither permit congress nor a territorial legislature to exclude slavery from any united|states territory all omit to declare whether or not the same constitution permit a state or the people of a state to exclude possibly this be a mere omission but who can be quite sure if mclean or curtis have seek to get into the opinion a declaration of unlimited power in the people of a state to exclude slavery from limit just as chase and macy seek to get such declaration in behalf of the people of a territory into the nebraska bill ask who can be quite sure that would not have be vote down in the case as have be in the other the near approach to the point of declare the power of a state over slavery be make by judge nelson approach more than once use the precise idea and almost the language too of the nebraska act on occasion exact language be except in case where the power be restrain by the|united|state the law of the state be supreme over the subject of slavery within jurisdiction in what case the power of the state be so restrained by the|u.s.|constitution be leave an open question precisely as the same question as to the restraint on the power of the territory be leave open in the nebraska act put that and that together and have another nice little niche which may ere long see fill with another supreme|court decision declare that the constitution of the|united|state do not permit a state to exclude slavery from limit and this may especially be expect if the doctrine of care not whether slavery be vote down or vote up shall gain upon the public mind sufficiently to give promise that such a decision can be maintain when make such a decision be all that slavery now lack of be alike lawful in all the states welcome or unwelcome such decision be probably come and will soon be upon unless the power of the present political dynasty shall be meet and overthrow shall lie down pleasantly dream that the people of missouri be on the verge of make state free and shall awake to the reality instead that the|supreme|court have make illinois a slave state to meet and overthrow the power of that|dynasty be the work now before all those who would prevent that consummation that be what have to do but how can best do there be those who denounce openly to own friend and yet whisper softly that senator douglas be the apt instrument there be with which to effect that object do not tell nor have tell that wish any such object to be effect wish to infer all from the fact that now have a little quarrel with the present head of the dynasty and that have regularly vote with on a single point upon which and have never differ remind that be a very great man and that the large of be very small one let this be grant but a live dog be well than a dead lion judge douglas if not a dead lion for this work be at least a caged and toothless how can oppose the advance of slavery do not care anything about avowed mission be impress the public heart to care nothing about a lead douglas|democratic newspaper think douglas ' superior talent will be need to resist the revival of the african slave trade do douglas believe an effort to revive that trade be approach have not say so do really think so but if be how can resist for year have labor to prove a sacred right of white man to take negro slave into the new territory can possibly show that be less a sacred right to buy where can be buy cheap and unquestionably can be buy cheap in africa than in virginia have do all in power to reduce the whole question of slavery to of a mere right of property and as such how can oppose the foreign slave trade how can refuse that trade in that property shall be perfectly free"--unless do as a protection to the home production and as the home producer will probably not ask the protection will be wholly without a ground of opposition senator douglas hold know that a man may rightfully be wise to day than be yesterday that may rightfully change when find wrong but can for that reason run ahead and infer that will make any particular change of which have give no intimation can safely base action upon any such vague inference now as ever wish to not misrepresent judge douglas ' position question motif or do ought that can be personally offensive to whenever if ever and can come together on principle so that great cause may have assistance from great ability hope to have interpose no adventitious obstacle but clearly be not now with do not pretend to be do not promise to ever be cause then must be intrust to and conduct by own undoubted friend those whose hand be free whose heart be in the work who do care for the result two|years|ago the republicans of the nation muster over thirteen|hundred|thousand strong do this under the single impulse of resistance to a common danger with every external circumstance against of strange discordant and even hostile element gather from the wind and form and fight the battle through under the constant hot fire of a disciplined proud and pampered enemy do brave all then to falter now?--now when that same enemy be waver dissever and belligerent the result be not doubtful shall not fail if stand firm shall not fail wise council may accelerate or mistake delay but sooner or later the victory be sure to come the source for this text be transcript to the senate and house|of|representatif of the|united|state have receive from j.|calhoun esq president of the late constitutional convention of kansas a copy duly certify by of the constitution frame by that body with the expression of a hope that would submit the same to the consideration of congress with the view of the admission of kansas into the union as an independent state in compliance with this request herewith transmit to congress for action the constitution of kansas with the ordinance respect the public land as well as the letter of mr. calhoun date at lecompton on the 14th ultimo by which be accompany have receive but a single copy of the constitution and ordinance send this to the senate a great delusion seem to pervade the public mind in relation to the condition of party in kansas this arise from the difficulty of induce the american people to realize the fact that any portion of should be in a state of rebellion against the government under which live when speak of the affair of kansas be apt to refer merely to the existence of violent political party in that territory divide on the question of slavery just as speak of such party in the states this present no adequate idea of the true state of the case the dividing line there be not between political party both acknowledge the lawful existence of the government but between those who be loyal to this government and those who have endeavor to destroy existence by force and by usurpation between those who sustain and those who have do all in power to overthrow the territorial government establish by congress this government would long since have subvert have not be protect from assault by the troop of the|united|state such have be the condition of affair since inauguration ever since that period a large portion of the people of kansas have be in a state of rebellion against the government with a military leader at head of a most turbulent and dangerous character have never acknowledge but have constantly renounce and defy the government to which owe allegiance and have be all the time in a state of resistance against authority have all the time be endeavor to subvert and to establish a revolutionary government under the so call topeka constitution in stead even at this very moment the topeka legislature be in session whoever have read the correspondence of governor walker with the|state|department recently communicate to the senate will be convince that this picture be not overdrawn always protest against the withdrawal of any portion of the military force of the|united|state from the territory deem presence absolutely necessary for the preservation of the regular government and the execution of the law in very first dispatch to the secretary of state date june|2,|1857 say the most alarming movement however proceed from the assembling on the|9th|june|of|the so call topeka legislature with a view to the enactment of an entire code of law of course will be endeavor to prevent such a result as would lead to inevitable and disastrous collision and in fact renew the civil war in kansas this be with difficulty prevent by the effort of governor walker but soon thereafter on find request general harney to furnish a regiment of dragoon to proceed to the city of lawrence and this for the reason that have receive authentic intelligence verify by own actual observation that a dangerous rebellion have occur involve an open defiance of the law and the establishment of an insurgent government in that city in the governor 's dispatch of july|15 inform the secretary of state this movement at lawrence be the beginning of a plan originate in that city to organize insurrection throughout the territory and especially in all town city or county where the republican party have a majority lawrence be the hotbed of all the abolition movement in this territory be the town establish by the abolition society of the east and whilst there be respectable people there be fill by a considerable number of mercenary who be pay by abolition society to perpetuate and diffuse agitation throughout kansas and prevent a peaceful settlement of this question have fail in induce own so call topeka|state legislature to organize this insurrection lawrence have commence and if not arrest the rebellion will extend throughout the territory and again in order to send this communication immediately by mail must close by assure that the spirit of rebellion pervade the great mass of the republican party of this territory instigate as entertain no doubt be by eastern society have in view result most disastrous to the government and to the union and that the continue presence of general harney here be indispensable as originally stipulate by with a large body of dragoon and several battery on the|20th|july,|1857 general lane under the authority of the topeka convention undertake as governor walker inform to organize the whole so call free state party into volunteer and to take the name of all who refuse enrollment the professed object be to protect the poll at the election in august of the new insurgent topeka|state legislature the object of take the name of all who refuse enrollment be to terrify the free state conservative into submission this be prove by recent atrocity commit on such man by topekaites the speedy location of large body of regular troop here with battery be necessary the lawrence insurgent await the development of this new revolutionary military organization in the governor 's dispatch of july|27 say that general lane and staff everywhere deny the authority of the territorial law and counsel a total disregard of these enactment without make further quotation of a similar character from other dispatch of governor walker appear by a reference to mr. stanton 's communication to general cass of the|9th|of|december last that the important step of call the legislature together be take after have become satisfied that the election order by the convention on the 21st instant could not be conduct without collision and bloodshed so intense be the disloyal feeling among the enemy of the government establish by congress that an election which afford an opportunity if in the majority of make kansas a free state accord to own professed desire could not be conduct without collision and bloodshed the truth be that up till the present moment the enemy of the exist government still adhere to topeka revolutionary constitution and government the very first paragraph of the message of governor robinson date on the|7th|of|december to the topeka legislature now assemble at lawrence contain an open defiance of the constitution and law of the|united|state the governor say the convention which frame the constitution at topeka originate with the people of kansas|territory have adopt and ratify the same twice by a direct vote and also indirectly through election of state officer and member of the state legislature yet have please the administration to regard the whole proceeding revolutionary this topeka government adhere to with such treasonable pertinacity be a government in direct opposition to the exist government prescribe and recognize by congress be a usurpation of the same character as would be for a portion of the people of any state of the union to undertake to establish a separate government within limit for the purpose of redress any grievance real or imaginary of which may complain against the legitimate state government such a principle if carry into execution would destroy all lawful authority and produce universal anarchy from this statement of fact the reason become palpable why the enemy of the government authorize by congress have refuse to vote for delegate to the kansas constitutional convention and also afterwards on the question of slavery submit by to the people be because have ever refuse to sanction or recognize any other constitution than that frame at topeka have the whole lecompton constitution be submit to the people the adherent of this organization would doubtless have vote against because if successful would thus have remove an obstacle out of the way of own revolutionary constitution would have do this not upon a consideration of the merit of the whole or any part of the lecompton constitution but simply because have ever resist the authority of the government authorize by congress from which emanate such be the unfortunate condition of affair in the territory what be the right as well as the duty of the law abide people be silently and patiently to submit to the topeka usurpation or adopt the necessary measure to establish a constitution under the authority of the organic law of congress that this law recognize the right of the people of the territory without any enable act from congress to form a state constitution be too clear for argument for congress to leave the people of the territory perfectly free in frame constitution to form and regulate domestic institution in own way subject only to the|united|state and then to say that shall not be permit to proceed and frame a constitution in own way without an express authority from congress appear to be almost a contradiction in term would be much more plausible to contend that congress have no power to pass such an enable act than to argue that the people of a territory may be keep out of the union for an indefinite period and until may please congress to permit to exercise the right of self government this would be to adopt not own way but the way which congress may prescribe be impossible that any people could have proceed with more regularity in the formation of a constitution than the people of kansas have do be necessary first to ascertain whether be the desire of the people to be relieve from territorial dependence and establish a state government for this purpose the territorial legislature in pass a law for take the sense of the people of this territory upon the expediency of call a convention to form a state constitution at the general election to be hold in october,|1856 the sense of the people be accordingly take and decide in favor of a convention be true that at this election the enemy of the territorial government do not vote because be then engage at topeka without the slight pretext of lawful authority in frame a constitution of own for the purpose of subvert the territorial government in pursuance of this decision of the people in favor of a convention the territorial legislature on the|27th|day|of|february,|1857 pass an act for the election of delegate on the|third|monday|of|june,|1857 to frame a state constitution this law be as fair in provision as any that ever pass a legislative body for a similar purpose the right of suffrage at this election be clearly and justly define every bona fide inhabitant of the|territory|of|kansas on the|third|monday|of|june of the election who be a citizen of the|united|state above and have reside therein for three|months previous to that date be entitle to vote in order to avoid all interference from neighbor states or territories with the freedom and fairness of the election provision be make for the registry of the qualified voter and in pursuance thereof voter be register governor walker do whole duty in urge all the qualified citizen of kansas to vote at this election in inaugural address on the|27th|may|last inform under practice the preliminary act of frame a state constitution be uniformly perform through the instrumentality of a convention of delegate choose by the people that convention be now about to be elect by under the call of the territorial legislature create and still recognize by the authority of congress and clothe by in the comprehensive language of the organic law with full power to make such an enactment the territorial legislature then in assemble this convention be fully sustain by the act of congress and the authority of the convention be distinctly recognize in instruction from the president of the|united|state the governor also clearly and distinctly warn what would be the consequence if should not participate in the election the people of kansas then say be invite by the high authority know to the constitution to participate freely and fairly in the election of delegate to frame a constitution and state government the law have perform entire appropriate function when extend to the people the fight of suffrage but can not compel the performance of that duty throughout whole union however and wherever free government prevail those who abstain from the exercise of the right of suffrage authorize those who do vote to act for in that contingency and the absentee be as much bind under the law and constitution where there be no fraud or violence by the act of the majority of those who do vote as if all have participate in the election otherwise as voting must be voluntary self government would be impracticable and monarchy or despotism would remain as the only alternative may also be observe that at this period any hope if such have exist that the topeka constitution would ever be recognize by congress must have be abandon congress have adjourn on the 3d march previous have recognize the legal existence of the territorial legislature in a variety of form which need not enumerate indeed the delegate elect to the|house|of|representatives under a territorial law have be admit to seat and have just complete term of service on the|day previous to inauguration this be the propitious moment for settle all difficulty in kansas this be the time for abandon the revolutionary topeka organization and for the enemy of the exist government to conform to the law and to unite with friend in frame a state constitution but this refuse to do and the consequence of refusal to submit to lawful authority and vote at the election of delegate may yet prove to be of a most deplorable character would that the respect for the law of the land which so eminently distinguish the man of the past generation could be revive be a disregard and violation of law which have for year keep the|territory|of|kansas in a state of almost open rebellion against government be the same spirit which have produce actual rebellion in utah only safety consist in obedience and conformity to law should a general spirit against enforcement prevail this will prove fatal to as a nation acknowledge no master but the law and should cut loose from restraint and everyone do what seemeth good in own eye case will indeed be hopeless the enemy of the territorial government determine still to resist the authority of congress refuse to vote for delegate to the convention not because from circumstance which need not detail there be an omission to register the comparatively few voter who be inhabitant of certain county of kansas in the|early|spring|of|1857 but because have predetermine at all hazard to adhere to revolutionary organization and defeat the establishment of any other constitution than that which have frame at topeka the election be therefore suffer to pass by default but of this result the qualified elector who refuse to vote can never justly complain from this review be manifest that the lecompton convention accord to every principle of constitutional law be legally constitute and be invest with power to frame a constitution the sacred principle of popular sovereignty have be invoke in favor of the enemy of law and order in kansas but in what manner be popular sovereignty to be exercise in this country if not through the instrumentality of establish law in certain small republic of ancient time the people do assemble in primary meeting pass law and direct public affair in country this be manifestly impossible popular sovereignty can be exercise here only through the ballot box and if the people will refuse to exercise in this manner as have do in kansas at the election of delegate be not for to complain that right have be violate the kansas convention thus lawfully constitute proceed to frame a constitution and have complete work finally adjourn on the|7th|day|of|november|last do not think proper to submit the whole of this constitution to a popular vote but do submit the question whether kansas should be a free or a slave state to the people this be the question which have convulse the union and shake to very center this be the question which have light up the flame of civil war in kansas and have produce dangerous sectional party throughout the confederacy be of a character so paramount in respect to the condition of kansas as to rivet the anxious attention of the people of the whole country upon and alone no person think of any other question for own part when instruct governor walker in general term in favor of submit the constitution to the people have no object in view except the all absorb question of slavery in what manner the people of kansas may regulate other concern be not a subject which attract any attention in fact the general provision of recent state constitution after an experience of eight|year be so similar and so excellent that would be difficult to go far wrong at the|present|day in frame a new constitution then believe and still believe that under the organic act the kansas convention be bind to submit this all important question of slavery to the people be never however opinion that independently of this act would have be bind to submit any portion of the constitution to a popular vote in order to give validity have entertain such an opinion this would have be in opposition to many precedent in history commence in the very good age of the republic would have be in opposition to the principle which pervade institution and which be every|day carry out into practice that the people have the right to delegate to representative choose by sovereign power to frame constitution enact law and perform many other important act without require that these should be subject to subsequent approbation would be a most inconvenient limitation of own power impose by the people upon to exclude from exercise sovereignty in any lawful manner think proper be true that the people of kansas may if have please have require the convention to submit the constitution to a popular vote but this have not do the only remedy therefore in this case be that which exist in all other similar case if the delegate who frame the kansas constitution have in any manner violate the will of constituent the people always possess the power to change constitution or law accord to own pleasure the question of slavery be submit to an election of the people of kansas on the|21st|december|last in obedience to the mandate of the constitution here again a fair opportunity be present to the adherent of the topeka constitution if be the majority to decide this exciting question in own way and thus restore peace to the distracted territory but again refuse to exercise right of popular sovereignty and again suffer the election to pass by default heartily rejoice that a wise and well spirit prevail among a large majority of these people on the|first|monday|of|january and that do on that|day vote under the lecompton constitution for a governor and other state officer a member of congress and for member of the legislature this election be warmly contest by the party and a large vote be poll than at any previous election in the territory may now reasonably hope that the revolutionary topeka organization will be speedily and finally abandon and this will go far toward the final settlement of the unhappy difference in kansas if fraud have be commit at this election either by or both party the legislature and the people of kansas under constitution will know how to redress and punish these detestable but too common crime without any outside interference the people of kansas have then in own way and in strict accordance with the organic act frame a constitution and state government have submit the all important question of slavery to the people and have elect a governor a member to represent in congress member of the state legislature and other state officer now ask admission into the union under this constitution which be republican in form be for congress to decide whether will admit or reject the state which have thus be create for own part be decidedly in favor of admission and thus terminate the kansas question this will carry out the great principle of nonintervention recognize and sanction by the organic act which declare in express language in favor of nonintervention by congress with slavery in the|state or territories leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate domestic institution in own way subject only to the|united|state in this manner by localize the question of slavery and confine to the people whom immediately concern every patriot anxiously expect that this question would be banish from the hall of congress where have always exert a baneful influence throughout the whole country be proper that should briefly refer to the election hold under an act of the territorial legislature on the|first|monday|of|january last on the lecompton constitution this election be hold after the territory have be prepare for admission into the union as a sovereign state and when no authority exist in the territorial legislature which could possibly destroy existence or change character the election which be peaceably conduct under instruction involve a strange inconsistency a large majority of the person who vote against the lecompton constitution be at the very same time and place recognize valid existence in the most solemn and authentic manner by vote under provision have yet receive no official information of the result of this election as a question of expediency after the right have be maintain may be wise to reflect upon the benefit to kansas and to the whole country which would result from immediate admission into the union as well as the disaster which may follow rejection domestic peace will be the happy consequence of admission and that fine territory which have hitherto be tear by dissension will rapidly increase in population and wealth and speedily realize the blessing and the comfort which follow in the train of agricultural and mechanical industry the people will then be sovereign and can regulate own affair in own way if a majority of desire to abolish domestic slavery within the state there be no other possible mode by which this can be effect so speedily as by prompt admission the will of the majority be supreme and irresistible when express in an orderly and lawful manner can make and unmake constitution at pleasure would be absurd to say that can impose fetter upon own power which can not afterwards remove if could do this may tie own hand for a|hundre as well as for ten|year these be fundamental principle of american freedom and be recognize believe in some form or other by every state constitution and if congress in the act of admission should think proper to recognize can perceive no objection to such a course this have be do emphatically in the constitution of kansas declare in the bill of right that all political power be inherent in the people and all free government be round on authority and institute for benefit and therefore have at all time an inalienable and indefeasible right to alter reform or abolish form of government in such manner as may think proper the great state of new york be at this moment govern under a constitution frame and establish in direct opposition to the mode prescribe by the previous constitution if therefore the provision change the kansas constitution after the|year|1864 could by possibility be construe into a prohibition to make such a change previous to that period this prohibition would be wholly unavailing the legislature already elect may at very first session submit the question to a vote of the people whether will or will not have a convention to amend constitution and adopt all necessary mean for give effect to the popular will have be solemnly adjudge by the high judicial tribunal know to law that slavery exist in kansas by virtue of the|united|state kansas be therefore at this moment as much a slave state as georgia or south|carolina without this the equality of the sovereign states compose the union would be violate and the use and enjoyment of a territory acquire by the common treasure of all the states would be close against the people and the property of nearly|half the member of the confederacy slavery can therefore never be prohibit in kansas except by mean of a constitutional provision and in no other manner can this be obtain so promptly if a majority of the people desire as by admit into the union under present constitution on the other hand should congress reject the constitution under the idea of afford the disaffect in kansas a third opportunity of prohibit slavery in the state which may have do twice before if in the majority no man can foretell the consequence if congress for the sake of those man who refuse to vote for delegate to the convention when may have exclude slavery from the constitution and who afterwards refuse to vote on the|21st|december|last when may as claim have stricken slavery from the constitution should now reject the state because slavery remain in the constitution be manifest that the agitation upon this dangerous subject will be renew in a more alarming form than have ever yet assume every patriot in the country have indulge the hope that the kansas and nebraska act would put a final end to the slavery agitation at least in congress which have for more than year convulse the country and endanger the union this act involve great and fundamental principle and if fairly carry into effect will settle the question should the agitation be again revive should the people of the sister states be again estrange from each other with more than former bitterness this will arise from a cause so far as the interest of kansas be concern more trifling and insignificant than have ever stir the element of a great people into commotion to the people of kansas the only practical difference between admission or rejection depend simply upon the fact whether can more speedily change the present constitution if do not accord with the will of the majority or frame a second constitution to be submit to congress hereafter even if this be a question of mere expediency and not of right the small difference of time way or the other be of not the least importance when contrast with the evil which must necessarily result to the whole country from a revival of the slavery agitation in consider this question should never be forget that in proportion to insignificance let the decision be what may so far as may affect the|few|thousand inhabitant of kansas who have from the beginning resist the constitution and the law for this very reason the rejection of the constitution will be so much the more keenly feel by the people of of of this union where slavery be recognize under the|united|state again the speedy admission of kansas into the union would restore peace and quiet to the whole country already the affair of this territory have engross an undue proportion of public attention have sadly affect the friendly relation of the people of the states with each other and alarm the fear of patriot for the safety of the union kansas once admit into the union the excitement become localize and will soon die away for want of outside aliment then every difficulty will be settle at the ballot box besides and this be no trifling consideration shall then be enable to withdraw the troop of the|united|state from kansas and employ on branch of service where be much need have be keep there on the earnest importunity of governor walker to maintain the existence of the territorial government and secure the execution of the law consider that at|least|2,000 regular troop under the command of general harney be necessary for this purpose act upon reliable information have be oblige in some degree to interfere with the expedition to utah in order to keep down rebellion in kansas this have involve a very heavy expense to the government kansas once admit be believe there will no longer be any occasion there for troop of the|united|state have thus perform duty on this important question under a deep sense of responsibility to god and country public life will terminate within a brief period and have no other object of earthly ambition than to leave country in a peaceful and prosperous condition and to live in the affection and respect of countryman the dark and ominous cloud which now appear to be impend over the union conscientiously believe may be dissipate with honor to every portion of by the admission of kansas during the present session of congress whereas if should be reject greatly fear these cloud will become dark and more ominous than any which have ever yet threaten the constitution and the union april|6 1858- proclamation regard the rebellion in utah whereas the|territory|of|utah be settle by certain emigrant from the states and from foreign country who have for several|years|past manifest a spirit of insubordination to the constitution and law of the|united|state the great mass of those settler act under the influence of leader to whom seem to have surrender judgment refuse to be control by any other authority have be often advise to obedience and these friendly counsel have be answer with defiance the officer of the|federal|government have be drive from the territory for no offense but an effort to do swear duty other have be prevent from go there by threat of assassination judge have be violently interrupt in the performance of function and the record of the court have be seize and destroy or conceal many other act of unlawful violence have be perpetrate and the right to repeat have be openly claim by the lead inhabitant with at least the silent acquiescence of nearly all the other hostility to the lawful government of the country have at length become so violent that no officer bear a commission from the chief magistrate of the union can enter the territory or remain there with safety and all those officer recently appoint have be unable to go to salt|lake or anywhere else in utah beyond the immediate power of the army indeed such be believe to be the condition to which a strange system of terrorism have bring the inhabitant of that region that no one among could express an opinion favorable to this government or even propose to obey law without expose life and property to peril after carefully consider this state of affair and maturely weigh the obligation be under to see the law faithfully execute seem to right and proper that should make such use of the military force at disposal as may be necessary to protect the federal officer in go into the|territory|of|utah and in perform duty after arrive there accordingly order a detachment of the army to march for the city of salt|lake or within reach of that place and to act in case of need as a posse for the enforcement of the law but in the meantime the hatred of that misguided people for the just and legal authority of the government have become so intense that resolve to measure military strength with that of the union have organize an armed force far from contemptible in point of number and train if not with skill at least with great assiduity and perseverance while the troop of the|united|state be on march a train of baggage wagon which happen to be unprotected be attack and destroy by a portion of the mormon force and the provision and store with which the train be laden be wantonly burn in short present attitude be of decide and unreserve enmity to the|united|state and to all loyal citizen determination to oppose the authority of the government by military force have not only be express in word but manifest in overt act of the most unequivocal character fellow citizen of utah this be rebellion against the government to which owe allegiance be levy war against the|united|state and involve in the guilt of treason persistence in will bring to condign punishment to ruin and to shame for be mere madness to suppose that with limited resource can successfully resist the force of this great and powerful nation if have calculate upon the forbearance of the|united|state if have permit yourself to suppose that this government will fail to put forth strength and bring to submission have fall into a grave mistake have settle upon territory which lie geographically in the heart of the union the land live upon be purchase by the|united|state and pay for out of treasury the proprietary right and title to be in and not in utah be bound on every side by states and territories whose people be true to the union be absurd to believe that will or can permit to erect in very midst a government of own not only independent of the authority which all acknowledge but hostile to and interest do not deceive yourself nor try to mislead other by propagate the idea that this be a crusade against religion the constitution and law of this country can take no notice of creed whether be true or false that be a question between god and yourself in which disclaim all right to interfere if obey the law keep the peace and respect the just right of other will be perfectly secure and may live on in present faith or change for another at pleasure every intelligent man among know very well that this government have never directly or indirectly seek to molest in worship to control in ecclesiastical affair or even to influence in religious opinion this rebellion be not merely a violation of legal duty be without just cause without reason without excuse never make a complaint that be not listen to with patience never exhibit a real grievance that be not redress as promptly as could be the law and regulation enact for government by congress have be equal and just and enforcement be manifestly necessary for own welfare and happiness have never ask repeal be similar in every material respect to the law which have be pass for the other territories|of|the|union and which everywhere else with partial exception have be cheerfully obey no people ever live who be free from unnecessary legal restraint than human wisdom never devise a political system which bestow more blessing or impose light burden than the government of the|united|state in operation upon the territories but be anxious to save the effusion of blood and to avoid the indiscriminate punishment of a whole people for crime of which be not probable that all be equally guilty offer now a free and full pardon to all who will submit to the just authority of if refuse to accept let the consequence fall upon own head but conjure to pause deliberately and reflect well before reject this tender of peace and good will now therefore james|buchanan president of the|united|state have think proper to issue this proclamation enjoin upon all public officer in the|territory|of|utah to be diligent and faithful to the full extent of power in the execution of the law command all citizen of the|united|state in say territory to aid and assist the officer in the performance of duty offer to the inhabitant of utah who shall submit to the law a free pardon for the sedition and treason heretofore by commit warn those who shall persist after notice of this proclamation in the present rebellion against the|united|state that must expect no further lenity but look to be rigorously deal with accord to desert and declare that the military force now in utah and hereafter to be send there will not be withdraw until the inhabitant of that territory shall manifest a proper sense of the duty which owe to this government in testimony whereof have hereunto set hand and cause the seal of the|united|state to be affix to these present do at the city of washington the|6th|day|of|april,|1858 and of the|independence|of|the|united|state the second james|buchanan by the president lewis cass secretary of state transcript fellow citizens of the senate and house|of|representatif in obedience to the command of the constitution have now become duty to give to congress information of the state of the union and recommend to consideration such measure as judge to be necessary and expedient but first and above all thank be due to almighty god for the numerous benefit which have bestow upon this people and united prayer ought to ascend to that would continue to bless great republic in time to come as have bless in time past since the adjournment of the last congress constituent have enjoy an unusual degree of health the earth have yield fruit abundantly and have bountifully reward the toil of the husbandman great staple have command high price and up till within a brief period manufacturing mineral and mechanical occupation have largely partake of the general prosperity have possess all the element of material wealth in rich abundance and yet notwithstanding all these advantage country in monetary interest be at the present moment in a deplorable condition in the midst of unsurpassed plenty in all the production of agriculture and in all the element of national wealth find manufacture suspend public work retard private enterprise of different kind abandon and thousand of useful laborer throw out of employment and reduce to want the revenue of the government which be chiefly derive from duty on import from abroad have be greatly reduce whilst the appropriation make by congress at last session for the|current|fiscal|year be very large in amount under these circumstance a loan may be require before the close of present session but this although deeply to be regret would prove to be only a slight misfortune when compare with the suffering and distress prevailing among the people with this the government can not fail deeply to sympathize though may be without the power to extend relief be duty to inquire what have produce such unfortunate result and whether recurrence can be prevent in all former revulsion the blame may have be fairly attribute to a variety of cooperate cause but not so upon the present occasion be apparent that exist misfortune have proceed solely from extravagant and vicious system of paper currency and bank credit excite the people to wild speculation and gambling in stock these revulsion must continue to recur at successive interval so long as the amount of the paper currency and bank loan and discount of the country shall be leave to the discretion of irresponsible banking institution which from the very law of nature will consult the interest of stockholder rather than the public welfare the framer of the constitution when give to congress the power to coin money and to regulate the value thereof and prohibit the states from coin money emit bill of credit or make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debt suppose have protect the people against the evil of an excessive and irredeemable paper currency be not responsible for the exist anomaly that a government endow with the sovereign attribute of coin money and regulate the value thereof should have no power to prevent other from drive this coin out of the country and fill up the channel of circulation with paper which do not represent gold and silver be of the high and most responsible duty of government to insure to the people a sound circulate medium the amount of which ought to be adapt with the utmost possible wisdom and skill to the want of internal trade and foreign exchange if this be either greatly above or greatly below the proper standard the marketable value of every man 's property be increase or diminish in the same proportion and injustice to individual as well as incalculable evil to the community be the consequence unfortunately under the construction of the|federal|constitution which have now prevail too long to be change this important and delicate duty have be dissever from the coin power and virtually transfer to more|than|1,400 state bank act independently of each other and regulate paper issue almost exclusively by a regard to the present interest of stockholder exercise the sovereign power of provide a paper currency instead of coin for the country the first duty which these bank owe to the public be to keep in vault a sufficient amount of gold and silver to insure the convertibility of note into coin at all time and under all circumstance no bank ought ever to be charter without such restriction on business as to secure this result all other restriction be comparatively vain this be the only true touchstone the only efficient regulator of a paper currency the only which can guard the public against overissue and bank suspension as a collateral and eventual security be doubtless wise and in all case ought to be require that bank shall hold an amount of united|state or state security equal to note in circulation and pledge for redemption this however furnish no adequate security against overissue on the contrary may be pervert to inflate the currency indeed be possible by this mean to convert all the debt of the|united|state and state|government into bank note without reference to the specie require to redeem however valuable these security may be in can not be convert into gold and silver at the moment of pressure as experience teach in sufficient time to prevent bank suspension and the depreciation of bank note in england which be to a considerable extent a paper money country though vastly behind own in this respect be deem advisable anterior to the act of parliament of which wisely separate the issue of note from the banking department for the|bank|of|england always to keep on hand gold and silver equal to third of combined circulation and deposit if this proportion be no more than sufficient to secure the convertibility of note with the whole of great|britain and to some extent the continent of europe as a field for circulation render almost impossible that a sudden and immediate run to a dangerous amount should be make upon the same proportion would certainly be insufficient under banking system each of bank have but a limited circumference for circulation and in the course of a|very|few|days the depositor and note holder may demand from such a bank a sufficient amount in specie to compel to suspend even although have coin in vault equal to third of immediate liability and yet be not aware with the exception of the bank of louisiana that any state bank throughout the union have be require by charter to keep this or any other proportion of gold and silver compare with the amount of combined circulation and deposit what have be the consequence in a recent report make by the|treasury|department on the condition of the bank throughout the different states accord to return date nearest to january,|1857 the aggregate amount of actual specie in vault be of circulation and of deposit thus appear that these bank in the aggregate have considerably less than dollar in of gold and silver compare with circulation and deposit be palpable therefore that the very first pressure must drive to suspension and deprive the people of a convertible currency with all disastrous consequence be truly wonderful that should have so long continue to preserve credit when a demand for the payment of seventh of immediate liability would have drive into insolvency and this be the condition of the bank notwithstanding that four|hundred|million of gold from california have flow in upon within the|last|eight|years and the tide still continue to flow indeed such have be the extravagance of bank credit that the bank now hold a considerably less amount of specie either in proportion to capital or to circulation and deposit combine than do before the discovery of gold in california whilst in the|year|1848 specie in proportion to capital be more than equal to one|dollar for four|and|a|half in do not amount to one|dollar for every|six|dollar and three|cent of capital in the|year|1848 the specie be equal within a very small fraction to one|dollar in of circulation and deposit in be not equal to one|dollar in seven|and|a|half of circulation and deposit from this statement be easy to account for financial history for have be a history of extravagant expansion in the business of the country follow by ruinous contraction at successive interval the good and most enterprising man have be tempt to ruin by excessive bank loan of mere paper credit excite to extravagant importation of foreign good wild speculation and ruinous and demoralize stock gambling when the crisis arrive as arrive must the bank can extend no relief to the people in a vain struggle to redeem liability in specie be compel to contract loan and issue and at last in the|hour of distress when assistance be most need and debtor together sink into insolvency be this paper system of extravagant expansion raise the nominal price of every article far beyond real value when compare with the cost of similar article in country whose circulation be wisely regulate which have prevent from compete in own market with foreign manufacturer have produce extravagant importation and have counteract the effect of the large incidental protection afford to domestic manufacture by the present revenue tariff but for this the branch of manufacture compose of raw material the production of own country such as cotton iron and woolen fabric would not only have acquire almost exclusive possession of the home market but would have create for a foreign market throughout the world deplorable however as may be present financial condition may yet indulge in bright hope for the future no other nation have ever exist which could have endure such violent expansion and contraction of paper credit without last injury yet the buoyancy of youth the energy of population and the spirit which never quail before difficulty will enable soon to recover from present financial embarrassment and may even occasion speedily to forget the lesson which have teach in the meantime be the duty of the government by all proper mean within power to aid in alleviate the suffering of the people occasion by the suspension of the bank and to provide against a recurrence of the same calamity unfortunately in either aspect of the ease can do but little thank to the independent treasury the government have not suspend payment as be compel to do by the failure of the bank in will continue to discharge liability to the people in gold and silver disbursement in coin will pass into circulation and materially assist in restore a sound currency from high credit should be compel to make a temporary loan can be effect on advantageous term this however shall if possible be avoid but if not then the amount shall be limit to the low practicable sum have therefore determine that whilst no useful government work already in progress shall be suspend new work not already commence will be postpone if this can be do without injury to the country those necessary for defense shall proceed as though there have be no crisis in monetary affair but the|federal|government can not do much to provide against a recurrence of exist evil even if insurmountable constitutional objection do not exist against the creation of a national bank this would furnish no adequate preventive security the history of the last bank|of|the|united|state abundantly prove the truth of this assertion such a bank could not if would regulate the issue and credit of state bank in such a manner as to prevent the ruinous expansion and contraction in currency which afflict the country throughout the existence of the late bank or secure against future suspension in an effort be make by the|bank|of|england to curtail the issue of the country bank under the most favorable circumstance the paper currency have be expand to a ruinous extent and the bank put forth all power to contract in order to reduce price and restore the equilibrium of the foreign exchange accordingly commence a system of curtailment of loan and issue in the vain hope that the joint stock and private bank of the kingdom would be compel to follow example find however that as contract expand and at the end of the process to employ the language of a very high official authority whatever reduction of the paper circulation be effect by the|bank|of|england in be more than make up by the issue of the country bank but a bank of the|united|state would not if could restrain the issue and loan of the state bank because duty as a regulator of the currency must often be in direct conflict with the immediate interest of stockholder if expect agent to restrain or control another interest must at least in some degree be antagonistic but the director of a bank of the|united|state would feel the same interest and the same inclination with the director of the state bank to expand the currency to accommodate favorite and friend with loan and to declare large dividend such have be experience in regard to the last bank after all must mainly rely upon the patriotism and wisdom of the states for the prevention and redress of the evil if will afford a real specie basis for paper circulation by increase the denomination of bank note first to and afterwards to fifty|dollars if will require that the bank shall at all time keep on hand of gold and silver for every dollar of circulation and deposit and if will provide by a self execute enactment which nothing can arrest that the moment suspend shall go into liquidation believe that such provision with a weekly publication by each bank of a statement of condition would go far to secure against future suspension of specie payment congress in opinion possess the power to pass a uniform bankrupt law applicable to all banking institution throughout the|united|state and strongly recommend exercise this would make the irreversible organic law of each bank 's existence that a suspension of specie payment shall produce civil death the instinct of self preservation would then compel to perform duty in such a manner as to escape the penalty and preserve life the existence of bank and the circulation of bank paper be so identify with the habit of people that can not at this|day be suddenly abolish without much immediate injury to the country if could confine to appropriate sphere and prevent from administer to the spirit of wild and reckless speculation by extravagant loan and issue may be continue with advantage to the public but this say after long and much reflection if experience shall prove to be impossible to enjoy the facility which well regulate bank may afford without at the same time suffer the calamity which the excess of the bank have hitherto inflict upon the country would then be far the less evil to deprive altogether of the power to issue a paper currency and confine to the function of bank of deposit and discount relation with foreign government be upon the whole in a satisfactory condition the diplomatic difficulty which exist between the government of the|united|state and that of great|britain at the adjournment of the last congress have be happily terminate by the appointment of a british minister to this country who have be cordially receive whilst be greatly to the interest as be convince be the sincere desire of the government and people of the country to be on term of intimate friendship with each other have be misfortune almost always to have have some irritating if not dangerous outstanding question with great|britain since the origin of the government have be employ in negotiate treaty with that power and afterwards in discuss true intent and meaning in this respect the convention of april|19,|1850 commonly call the clayton and bulwer treaty have be the most unfortunate of all because the government place directly opposite and contradictory construction upon first and most important article whilst in the|united|state believe that this treaty would place both power upon an exact equality by the stipulation that neither will ever occupy or fortify or colonize or assume or exercise any dominion over any part of central|america be contend by the|british|government that the true construction of this language have leave in the rightful possession of all that portion of central|america which be in occupancy at the date of the treaty in fact that the treaty be a virtual recognition on the part of the|united|state of the right of great|britain either as owner or protector to the whole extensive coast of central|america sweep round from the|rio|hondo to the port and harbor of san|juan|de|nicaragua together with the adjacent bay|island except the comparatively small portion of this between the sarstoon and cape|honduras accord to construction the treaty do no more than simply prohibit from extend possession in beyond the present limit be not too much to assert that if in the|united|state the treaty have be consider susceptible of such a construction never would have be negotiate under the authority of the president nor would have receive the approbation of the senate the universal conviction in the|united|state be that when government consent to violate traditional and time honor policy and to stipulate with a foreign government never to occupy or acquire territory in the central|american portion of own continent the consideration for this sacrifice be that great|britain should in this respect at least be place in the same position with whilst have no right to doubt the sincerity of the|british|government in construction of the treaty be at the same time deliberate conviction that this construction be in opposition both to letter and spirit under the late administration negotiation be institute between the government for the purpose if possible of remove these difficulty and a treaty have this laudable object in view be sign at london on the|17th|october,|1856 and be submit by the president to the senate on the following 10th of december whether this treaty either in original or amend form would have accomplish the object intend without give birth to new and embarrassing complication between the government may perhaps be well question certain be however be render much less objectionable by the different amendment make to by the senate the treaty as amend be ratify by on and be transmit to london for ratification by that government express willingness to concur in all the amendment make by the senate with the single exception of the clause relate to ruatan and the other island in the|bay|of|honduras the article in the original treaty as submit to the senate after recite that these island and inhabitant have be by a convention bear date the|27th|day|of|august,|1856 between britannic|majesty and the|republic|of|honduras constitute and declare a free territory under the sovereignty of the say republic|of|honduras stipulate that the contracting party do hereby mutually engage to recognize and respect in all future time the independence and right of the say free territory as a part of the|republic|of|honduras upon an examination of this convention between great|britain and honduras of the|27th|august,|1856 be find that whilst declare the|bay|island to be a free territory under the sovereignty of the|republic|of|honduras deprive that republic of right without which sovereignty over could scarcely be say to exist divide from the remainder of honduras and give to inhabitant a separate government of own with legislative executive and judicial officer elect by deprive the government|of|hondura of the tax power in every form and exempt the people of the island from the performance of military duty except for own exclusive defense also prohibit that republic from erect fortification upon for protection thus leave open to invasion from any|quarter and finally provide that slavery shall not at any time hereafter be permit to exist therein have honduras ratify this convention would have ratify the establishment of a state substantially independent within own limit and a state at all time subject to british influence and control moreover have the|united|state ratify the treaty with great|britain in original form should have be bind to recognize and respect in all future time these stipulation to the prejudice of honduras be in direct opposition to the spirit and meaning of the clayton and bulwer treaty as understand in the|united|state the senate reject the entire clause and substitute in stead a simple recognition of the sovereign right of honduras to these island in the following language the contracting party do hereby mutually engage to recognize and respect the island of ruatan bonaco utila barbaretta helena and moral situate in the|bay|of|honduras and off the coast of the|republic|of|honduras as under the sovereignty and as part of the say republic|of|honduras great|britain reject this amendment assign as the only reason that the ratification of the convention of the|27th|august,|1856 between and honduras have not be exchange owe to the hesitation of that government have this be do be state that majesty 's government would have have little difficulty in agree to the modification propose by the senate which then would have have in effect the same signification as the original wording whether this would have be the effect whether the mere circumstance of the exchange of the ratification of the british convention with honduras prior in point of time to the ratification of treaty with great|britain would in effect have have the same signification as the original wording and thus have nullify the amendment of the senate may well be doubt be perhaps fortunate that the question have never arise the|british|government immediately after reject the treaty as amend propose to enter into a new treaty with the|united|state similar in all respect to the treaty which have just refuse to ratify if the|united|state would consent to add to the senate 's clear and unqualified recognition of the sovereignty of honduras over the|bay|islands the follow conditional stipulation whenever and so soon as the|republic|of|honduras shall have conclude and ratify a treaty with great|britain by which great|britain shall have cede and the|republic|of|honduras shall have accept the say island subject to the provision and condition contain in such treaty this proposition be of course reject after the senate have refuse to recognize the british convention with honduras of the|27th|august,|1856 with full knowledge of content be impossible for necessarily ignorant of the provision and condition which may be contain in a future convention between the same party to sanction in advance the fact be that when nation like great|britain and the|united|state mutually desirous as be and trust ever may be of maintain the most friendly relation with each other have unfortunately conclude a treaty which understand in sens directly opposite the wise course be to abrogate such a treaty by mutual consent and to commence anew have this be do promptly all difficulty in central|america would most probably ere this have be adjust to the satisfaction of both party the time spend in discuss the meaning of the clayton and bulwer treaty would have be devote to this praiseworthy purpose and the task would have be the more easily accomplish because the interest of the country in central|america be identical be confine to secure safe transit over all the route across the isthmus whilst entertain these sentiment shall nevertheless not refuse to contribute to any reasonable adjustment of the central|american question which be not practically inconsistent with the american interpretation of the treaty overture for this purpose have be recently make by the|british|government in a friendly spirit which cordially reciprocate but whether this renew effort will result in success be not yet prepared to express an opinion a brief period will determine with france ancient relation of friendship still continue to exist the|french|government have in several recent instance which nee not be enumerate evince a spirit of good will and kindness toward country which heartily reciprocate be notwithstanding much to be regret that nation whose production be of such a character as to invite the most extensive exchange and free commercial intercourse should continue to enforce ancient and obsolete restriction of trade against each other commercial treaty with france be in this respect an exception from treaty with all other commercial nation jealously levy discriminate duty both on tonnage and on article the growth produce or manufacture of the country when arrive in vessel belong to the other more|than|forty|years|ago on the 3d march,|1815 congress pass an act offering to all nation to admit vessel laden with national production into the port of the|united|state upon the same term with own vessel provide would reciprocate to similar advantage this act confine the reciprocity to the production of the respective foreign nation who may enter into the propose arrangement with the|united|state the act of may|24,|1828 remove this restriction and offer a similar reciprocity to all such vessel without reference to the origin of cargo upon these principle commercial treaty and arrangement have be round except with france and let hope that this exception may not long exist relation with russia remain as have ever be on the most friendly footing the present emperor as well as predecessor have never fail when the occasion offer to manifest good will to country and friendship have always be highly appreciate by the government and people of the|united|state with all other european|government except that of spain relation be as peaceful as could desire regret to say that no progress whatever have be make since the adjournment of congress toward the settlement of any of the numerous claim of citizen against the|spanish|government besides the outrage commit on flag by the spanish war frigate ferrolana on the high sea off the coast of cuba in march,|1855 by fire into the american mail steamer and detain and search remain unacknowledged and unredressed the general tone and temper of the|spanish|government toward that of the|united|state be much to be regret present envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to madrid have ask to be recall and be purpose to send out a new minister to spain with special instruction on all question pende between the government and with a determination to have speedily and amicably adjust if this be possible in the meantime whenever minister urge the just claim of citizen on the notice of be meet with the objection that congress have never make the appropriation recommend by president polk in annual message of december,|1847 to be pay to the|spanish|government for the purpose of distribution among the claimant in the amistad case a similar recommendation be make by immediate predecessor in message of december and entirely concur with both in the opinion that this indemnity be justly due under the treaty with spain of the|27th|of|october,|1795 earnestly recommend such an appropriation to the favorable consideration of congress a treaty of friendship and commerce be conclude at constantinople|on|the 13th december between the|united|state and persia the ratification of which be exchange at constantinople|on the|13th|june,|1857 and the treaty be proclaim by the president on the|18th|august,|1857 this treaty be believe will prove beneficial to american commerce the shah have manifest an earnest disposition to cultivate friendly relation with country and have express a strong wish that should be represent at teheran by a minister plenipotentiary and recommend that an appropriation be make for this purpose recent occurrence in china have be unfavorable to a revision of the treaty with that empire of the july,|1844 with a view to the security and extension of commerce the fourth article of this treaty stipulate for a revision of in case experience should prove this to be requisite in which case the government will at the expiration of twelve|year from the date of say convention treat amicably concern the same by mean of suitable person appoint to conduct such negotiation these year expire on the july,|1856 but long before that period be ascertain that important change in the treaty be necessary and several fruitless attempt be make by the commissioner of the|united|state to effect these change another effort be about to be make for the same purpose by commissioner in conjunction with the minister of england and france but this be suspend by the occurrence of hostility in the|canton|river between great|britain and these hostility have necessarily interrupt the trade of all nation with canton which be now in a state of blockade and have occasion a serious loss of life and property meanwhile the insurrection within the empire against the exist imperial dynasty still continue and be difficult to anticipate what will be the result under these circumstance have deem advisable to appoint a distinguished citizen of pennsylvania envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to proceed to china and to avail of any opportunity which may offer to effect change in the exist treaty favorable to american commerce leave the|united|state for the place of destination in july last in the war steamer minnesota special minister to china have also be appoint by the|governments|of|great|britain and france whilst minister have be instruct to occupy a neutral position in reference to the exist hostility at canton will cordially cooperate with the british and french minister in all peaceful measure to secure by treaty stipulation those just concession to commerce which the nation of the world have a right to expect and which china can not long be permit to withhold from assurance receive entertain no doubt that the minister will act in harmonious concert to obtain similar commercial treaty for each of the power represent can not fail to feel a deep interest in all that concern the welfare of the independent republics on own continent as well as of the|empire|of|brazil difficulty with new|granada which a short time since bore so threaten an aspect be be to be hope in a fair train of settlement in a manner just and honorable to both party the isthmus of central|america include that of panama be the great highway between the atlantic and pacific over which a large portion of the commerce of the world be destine to pass the|united|state be more deeply interested than any other nation in preserve the freedom and security of all the communication across this isthmus be duty therefore to take care that shall not be interrupt either by invasion from own country or by war between the independent states of central|america under treaty with new|granada of the|12th|december,|1846 be bind to guarantee the neutrality of the|isthmus|of|panama through which the panama railroad pass as well as the right of sovereignty and property which new|granada have and possess over the say territory this obligation be round upon equivalent grant by the treaty to the government and people of the|united|state under these circumstance recommend to congress the passage of an act authorize the president in case of necessity to employ the land and naval force of the|united|state to carry into effect this guaranty of neutrality and protection also recommend similar legislation for the security of any other route across the isthmus in which may acquire an interest by treaty with the independent republics on this continent be both duty and interest to cultivate the most friendly relation can never feel indifferent to fate and must always rejoice in prosperity unfortunately both for and for example and advice have lose much of influence in consequence of the lawless expedition which have be fit out against some of within the limit of country nothing be better calculate to retard steady material progress or impair character as a nation than the toleration of such enterprise in violation of the law of nation be of the first and high duty of any independent state in relation with the member of the great family of nation to restrain people from act of hostile aggression against citizen or subject the most eminent writer on public law do not hesitate to denounce such hostile act as robbery and murder weak and feeble state like those of central|america may not feel able to assert and vindicate right the case would be far different if expedition be set on foot within own territory to make private war against a powerful nation if such expedition be fit out from abroad against any portion of own country to burn down city murder and plunder people and usurp government should call any power on earth to the strict account for not prevent such enormity ever since the|administration|of|general|washington act of congress have be enforce to punish severely the crime of set on foot a military expedition within the limit of the|united|state to proceed from thence against a nation or state with whom be at peace the present neutrality act of april|20,|1818 be but little more than a collection of preexist law under this act the president be empower to employ the land and naval force and the militia for the purpose of prevent the carrying on of any such expedition or enterprise from the territory and jurisdiction of the|united|state and the collector of custom be authorize and require to detain any vessel in port when there be reason to believe be about to take part in such lawless enterprise when be first render probable that an attempt would be make to get up another unlawful expedition against nicaragua the secretary of state issue instruction to the marshal and district attorney which be direct by the|secretaries|of|war and the navy to the appropriate army and navy officer require to be vigilant and to use good exertion in carry into effect the provision of the|act|of|1818 notwithstanding these precaution the expedition have escape from shore such enterprise can do no possible good to the country but have already inflict much injury both on interest and character have prevent peaceful emigration from the|united|state to the|states|of|central|america which could not fail to prove highly beneficial to all the party concern in a pecuniary point of view alone citizen have sustain heavy loss from the seizure and closing of the transit route by the san|juan between the ocean the leader of the recent expedition be arrest at new|orleans but be discharge on give bail for appearance in the insufficient sum of commend the whole subject to the serious attention of congress believe that duty and interest as well as national character require that should adopt such measure as will be effectual in restrain citizen from commit such outrage regret to inform that the president of paraguay have refuse to ratify the treaty between the|united|state and that state as amend by the senate the signature of which be mention in the message of predecessor to congress at the opening of session in december the reason assign for this refusal will appear in the correspondence herewith submit be desirable to ascertain the fitness of the river la|plata and tributary for navigation by steam steamer water|witch be send thither for that purpose in this enterprise be successfully carry on until february,|1855 when whilst in the peaceful prosecution of voyage up the|parana|river the steamer be fire upon by a paraguayan fort the fire be return but as the|water|witch be of small force and not design for offensive operation retire from the conflict the pretext upon which the attack be make be a decree of the president of paraguay of october,|1854 prohibit foreign vessel of war from navigate the river of that state as paraguay however be the owner of but bank of the river of that name the other belong to corientes a state of the argentine confederation the right of government to expect that such a decree would be obey can not be acknowledge but the water witch be not properly speak a vessel of war be a small steamer engage in a scientific enterprise intend for the advantage of commercial state generally under these circumstance be constrain to consider the attack upon as unjustifiable and as call for satisfaction from the|paraguayan|government citizen of the|united|state also who be establish in business in paraguay have have property seize and take from and have otherwise be treat by the authority in an insulting and arbitrary manner which require redress a demand for these purpose will be make in a firm but conciliatory spirit this will the more probably be grant if the executive shall have authority to use other mean in the event of a refusal this be accordingly recommend be unnecessary to state in detail the alarming condition of the|territory|of|kansas at the time of inauguration the oppose party then stand in hostile array against each other and any accident may have relighte the flame of civil war besides at this critical moment kansas be leave without a governor by the resignation of governor geary on previous the territorial legislature have pass a law provide for the election of delegate on the third monday of june to a convention to meet on the|first|monday|of|september for the purpose of frame a constitution preparatory to admission into the union this law be in the main fair and just and be to be regret that all the qualified elector have not register and vote under provision at the time of the election for delegate an extensive organization exist in the territory whose avow object be if nee be to put down the lawful government by force and to establish a government of own under the so call topeka constitution the person attach to this revolutionary organization abstain from take any part in the election the act of the territorial legislature have omit to provide for submit to the people the constitution which may be frame by the convention and in the excited state of public feeling throughout kansas an apprehension extensively prevail that a design exist to force upon a constitution in relation to slavery against will in this emergency become duty as be unquestionable right have in view the union of all good citizen in support of the territorial law to express an opinion on the true construction of the provision concern slavery contain in the organic act of congress of the 30th may,|1854 congress declare to be the true intent and meaning of this act not to legislate slavery into any territory or state nor to exclude therefrom but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate domestic institution in own way under kansas when admit as a state be to be receive into the union with or without slavery as constitution may prescribe at the time of admission do congress mean by this language that the delegate elect to frame a constitution should have authority finally to decide the question of slavery or do intend by leave to the people that the people of kansas should decide this question by a direct vote on this subject confess have never entertain a serious doubt and therefore in instruction to governor walker of the|28th|march last merely say that when a constitution shall be submit to the people of the territory must be protect in the exercise of right of vote for or against that instrument and the fair expression of the popular will must not be interrupt by fraud or violence in express this opinion be far from intention to interfere with the decision of the people of kansas either for or against slavery from this have always carefully abstain intrust with the duty of take care that the law be faithfully execute only desire be that the people of kansas should furnish to congress the evidence require by the organic act whether for or against slavery and in this manner smooth passage into the union in emerge from the condition of territorial dependence into that of a sovereign state be duty in opinion to make known will by the vote of the majority on the direct question whether this important domestic institution should or should not continue to exist indeed this be the only possible mode in which will could be authentically ascertain the election of delegate to a convention must necessarily take place in separate district from this cause may readily happen as have often be the case that a majority of the people of a state or territory be on side of a question whilst a majority of the representative from the several district into which be divide may be upon the other side this arise front the fact that in some district delegate may be elect by small majority whilst in other those of different sentiment may receive majority sufficiently great not only to overcome the vote give for the former but to leave a large majority of the whole people in direct opposition to a majority of the delegate besides history prove that influence may be bring to bear on the representative sufficiently powerful to induce to disregard the will of constituent the truth be that no other authentic and satisfactory mode exist of ascertain the will of a majority of the people of any state or territory on an important and exciting question like that of slavery in kansas except by leave to a direct vote how wise then be for congress to pass over all subordinate and intermediate agency and proceed directly to the source of all legitimate power under institution how vain would any other principle prove in practice this may be illustrate by the case of kansas should be admit into the union with a constitution either maintain or abolish slavery against the sentiment of the people this could have no other effect than to continue and to exasperate the exist agitation during the brief period require to make the constitution conform to the irresistible will of the majority the friend and supporter of the nebraska and kansas act when struggle on a recent occasion to sustain wise provision before the great tribunal of the american people never differ about true meaning on this subject everywhere throughout the union publicly pledge faith and honor that would cheerfully submit the question of slavery to the decision of the bona fide people of kansas without any restriction or qualification whatever all be cordially unite upon the great doctrine of popular sovereignty which be the vital principle of free institution have then be insinuate from any|quarter that would be a sufficient compliance with the requisition of the organic law for the member of a convention thereafter to be elect to withhold the question of slavery from the people and to substitute own will for that of a legally ascertain majority of all constituent this would have be instantly reject everywhere remain true to the resolution adopt on a celebrated occasion recognize the right of the people of all the territories include kansas and nebraska act through the legally and fairly express will of a majority of actual resident and whenever the number of inhabitant justify to form a constitution with or without slavery and be admit into the union upon term of perfect equality with the other states the convention to frame a constitution for kansas meet on the first monday of september last be call together by virtue of an act of the territorial legislature whose lawful existence have be recognize by congress in different form and by different enactment a large proportion of the citizen of kansas do not think proper to register name and to vote at the election for delegate but an opportunity to do this have be fairly afford refusal to avail of right could in no manner affect the legality of the convention this convention proceed to frame a constitution for kansas and finally adjourn on but little difficulty occur in the convention except on the subject of slavery the truth be that the general provision of recent state constitution be so similar and may add so excellent that the difference between be not essential under the early practice of the government no constitution frame by the convention of a territory preparatory to admission into the union as a state have be submit to the people trust however the example set by the last congress require that the constitution of minnesota should be subject to the approval and ratification of the people of the propose state may be follow on future occasion take for grant that the convention of kansas would act in accordance with this example round as be on correct principle and hence instruction to governor walker in favor of submit the constitution to the people be express in general and unqualified term in the kansas nebraska act however this requirement as applicable to the whole constitution have not be insert and the convention be not bind by term to submit any other portion of the instrument to an election except that which relate to the domestic institution of slavery this will be render clear by a simple reference to language be not to legislate slavery into any territory or state nor to exclude therefrom but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate domestic institution in own way accord to the plain construction of the sentence the word domestic institution have a direct as have an appropriate reference to slavery domestic institution be limit to the family the relation between master and slave and a few other be domestic institution and be entirely distinct from institution of a political character besides there be no question then before congress nor indeed have there since be any serious question before the people of kansas or the country except that which relate to the domestic institution of slavery the convention after an angry and excited debate finally determine by a majority of only|two to submit the question of slavery to the people though at the last of the delegate present affix signature to the constitution a large majority of the convention be in favor of establish slavery in kansas accordingly insert an article in the constitution for this purpose similar in form to those which have be adopt by other territorial convention in the schedule however provide for the transition from a territorial to a state government the question have be fairly and explicitly refer to the people whether will have a constitution with or without slavery declare that before the constitution adopt by the convention shall be send to congress for admission into the union as a state an election shall be hold to decide this question at which all the white male inhabitant of the territory above be entitle to vote be to vote by ballot and the ballot cast at say election shall be indorse constitution with slavery and constitution with no slavery if there be a majority in favor of the constitution with slavery then be to be transmit to congress by the president of the convention in original form if on the contrary there shall be a majority in favor of the constitution with no slavery then the article provide for slavery shall be stricken from the constitution by the president of this convention and be expressly declare that no slavery shall exist in the|state|of|kansas except that the right of property in slave now in the territory shall in no manner be interfere with and in that event be make duty to have the constitution thus ratify transmit to for the admission of the state into the union at this election every citizen will have an opportunity of express opinion by vote whether kansas shall be receive into the union with or without slavery and thus this exciting question may be peacefully settle in the very mode require by the organic law the election will be hold under legitimate authority and if any portion of the inhabitant shall refuse to vote a fair opportunity to do so have be present this will be own voluntary act and alone will be responsible for the consequence whether kansas shall be a free or a slave state must eventually under some authority be decide by an election and the question can never be more clearly or distinctly present to the people than be at the present moment should this opportunity be reject may be involve for year in domestic discord and possibly in civil war before can again make up the issue now so fortunately tender and again reach the point have already attain kansas have for some|years occupy too much of the public attention be high time this should be direct to far more important object when once admit into the union whether with or without slavery the excitement beyond own limit will speedily pass away and will then for the first time be leave as ought to have be long since to manage own affair in own way if constitution on the subject of slavery or on any other subject be displease to a majority of the people no human power can prevent from change within a brief period under these circumstance may well be question whether the peace and quiet of the whole country be not of great importance than the mere temporary triumph of either of the political party in kansas should the constitution without slavery be adopt by the vote of the majority the right of property in slave now in the territory be reserve the number of these be very small but if be great the provision would be equally just and reasonable the slave be bring into the territory under the|united|state and be now the property of master this point have at length be finally decide by the high judicial tribunal of the country and this upon the plain principle that when a confederacy of sovereign states acquire a new territory at joint expense both equality and justice demand that the citizen of and all of shall have the right to take into whatsoever be recognize as property by the common constitution to have summarily confiscate the property in slave already in the territory would have be an act of gross injustice and contrary to the practice of the old states of the union which have abolish slavery a territorial government be establish for utah by act of congress approve the|9th|september,|1850 and the constitution and law of the|united|state be thereby extend over so far as the same or any provision thereof may be applicable this act provide for the appointment by the president by and with the advice and consent of the senate of a governor who be to be superintendent of indian affair a secretary judge of the supreme court a marshal and a district attorney subsequent act provide for the appointment of the officer necessary to extend land and indian system over the territory brigham|young be appoint the first governor on the|20th|september,|1850 and have hold the office ever since whilst governor young have be both governor and superintendent of indian affair throughout this period have be at the same time the head of the church call the|latter day|saint and profess to govern member and dispose of property by direct inspiration and authority from the almighty power have be therefore absolute over both church and state the people of utah almost exclusively belong to this church and believe with a fanatical spirit that be governor of the territory by divine appointment obey command as if these be direct revelation from heaven if therefore choose that government shall come into collision with the member of the|mormon|church will yield implicit obedience to will unfortunately exist fact leave but little doubt that such be determination without enter upon a minute history of occurrence be sufficient to say that all the officer of the|united|state judicial and executive with the single exception of indian agent have find necessary for own personal safety to withdraw from the territory and there no longer remain any government in utah but the despotism of brigham|young this be the condition of affair in the territory could not mistake the path of duty as chief executive|magistrate be bind to restore the supremacy of the constitution and law within limit in order to effect this purpose appoint a new governor and other federal officer for utah and send with a military force for protection and to aid as a posse comitatus in case of need in the execution of the law with the religious opinion of the mormons as long as remain mere opinion however deplorable in and revolt to the moral and religious sentiment of all christendom have no right to interfere action alone when in violation of the constitution and law of the|united|state become the legitimate subject for the jurisdiction of the civil magistrate instruction to governor cumming have therefore be frame in strict accordance with these principle at date a hope be indulge that no necessity may exist for employ the military in restore and maintain the authority of the law but this hope have now vanish governor young have by proclamation declare determination to maintain power by force and have already commit act of hostility against the|united|state unless should retrace step the|territory|of|utah will be in a state of open rebellion have commit these act of hostility notwithstanding major van|vliet an officer of the army send to utah by the|commanding|general to purchase provision for the troop have give the strong assurance of the peaceful intention of the government and that the troop would only be employ as a posse comitatus when call on by the civil authority to aid in the execution of the law there be reason to believe that governor young have long contemplate this result know that the continuance of despotic power depend upon the exclusion of all settler from the territory except those who will acknowledge divine mission and implicitly obey will and that an enlighten public opinion there would soon prostrate institution at war with the law both of god and man have therefore for several|year in order to maintain independence be industriously employ in collect and fabricate arm and munition of war and in discipline the mormons for military service as superintendent of indian affair have have an opportunity of tamper with the indian tribe and excite hostile feeling against the|united|state this accord to information have accomplish in regard to some of these tribe while other have remain true to allegiance and have communicate intrigue to indian agent have lay in a store of provision for three|years which in case of necessity as inform major van|vliet will conceal and then take to the mountain and bid defiance to all the power of the government a great part of all this may be idle boasting but yet no wise government will lightly estimate the effort which may be inspire by such frenzied fanaticism as exist among the mormons in utah this be the first rebellion which have exist in territories and humanity require that should put down in such a manner that shall be the last to trifle with would be to encourage and to render formidable ought to go there with such an impose force as to convince these delude people that resistance would be vain and thus spare the effusion of blood can in this manner good convince that be friend not enemy in order to accomplish this object will be necessary accord to the estimate of the|war|department to raise additional regiment and this earnestly recommend to congress at the present moment of depression in the revenue of the country be sorry to be oblige to recommend such a measure but feel confident of the support of congress cost what may in suppress the insurrection and in restore and maintain the sovereignty of the constitution and law over the|territory|of|utah recommend to congress the establishment of a territorial government over arizona incorporate with such portion of new|mexico as may deem expedient need scarcely adduce argument in support of this recommendation be bind to protect the life and the property of citizen inhabit arizona and these be now without any efficient protection present number be already considerable and be rapidly increase notwithstanding the disadvantage under which labor besides the propose territory be believe to be rich in mineral and agricultural resource especially in silver and copper the mail of the|united|state to california be now carry over throughout whole extent and this route be know to be the near and believe to be the good to the pacific long experience have deeply convince that a strict construction of the power grant to congress be the only true as well as the only safe theory of the constitution whilst this principle shall guide public conduct consider clear that under the war make power congress may appropriate money for the construction of a military road through the territories of the|united|state when this be absolutely necessary for the defense of any of the states against foreign invasion the constitution have confer upon congress power to declare war to raise and support army to provide and maintain a navy and to call forth the militia to repel invasion these high sovereign power necessarily involve important and responsible public duty and among there be none so sacred and so imperative as that of preserve soil from the invasion of a foreign enemy the constitution have therefore leave nothing on this point to construction but expressly require that the|united|state shall protect each of the states against invasion now if a military road over own territories be indispensably necessary to enable to meet and repel the invader follow as a necessary consequence not only that possess the power but be imperative duty to construct such a road would be an absurdity to invest a government with the unlimited power to make and conduct war and at the same time deny to the only mean of reach and defeat the enemy at the frontier without such a road be quite evident can not protect california and pacific possession against invasion can not by any other mean transport man and munition of war from the|atlantic|state in sufficient time successfully to defend these remote and distant portion of the republic experience have prove that the route across the isthmus of central|america be at good but a very uncertain and unreliable mode of communication but even if this be not the case would at once be close against in the event of war with a naval power so much strong than own as to enable to blockade the port at either end of these route after all therefore can only rely upon a military road through own territories and ever since the origin of the|government|congress have be in the practice of appropriate money from the public treasury for the construction of such road the difficulty and the expense of construct a military railroad to connect atlantic and pacific|states have be greatly exaggerate the distance on the arizona route near the second parallel of north latitude between the western boundary of texas on and the eastern boundary of california on the colorado from the good exploration now within knowledge do not exceed and the face of the country be in the main favorable for obvious reason the government ought not to undertake the work by mean of own agent this ought to be commit to other agency which congress may assist either by grant of land or money or by both upon such term and condition as may deem most beneficial for the country provision may thus be make not only for the safe rapid and economical transportation of troop and munition of war but also of the public mail the commercial interest of the whole country both east and west would be greatly promote by such a road and above all would be a powerful additional bond of union and although advantage of this kind whether postal commercial or political can not confer constitutional power yet may furnish auxiliary argument in favor of expedite a work which in judgment be clearly embrace within the war make power for these reason commend to the friendly consideration of congress the subject of the|pacific|railroad without finally commit to any particular route the report of the secretary of the treasury will furnish a detailed statement of the condition of the public finance and of the respective branch of the public service devolve upon that department|of|the|government by this report appear that the amount of revenue receive from all source into the treasury during the|fiscal|year|ending|the|30th|june,|1857 be which amount with the balance of remain in the treasury at the commencement of the|year make an aggregate for the service of the|year of the public expenditure for the|fiscal|year|ending|30th|june,|1857 amount to of which be apply to the redemption of the public debt include interest and premium leave in the treasury at the commencement of on the|1st|july,|1857 the receipt into the treasury for the|first|quarter of commence 1st|july,|1857 be and the estimate receipt of the remain three|quarters|to|the|30th|june,|1858 be make with the balance before state an aggregate of for the service of the actual expenditure during the|first|quarter of be of which be apply to the redemption of the public debt include interest and premium the probable expenditure of the remain three|quarters|to|30th|june,|1858 be include interest on the public debt make an aggregate of leave an estimate balance in the treasury at the close of of the amount of the public debt at the commencement of the|present|fiscal|year be the amount redeem since the|1st|of|july be leave a balance unredeeme at this time of the amount of estimate expenditure for the remain three|quarters of will in all probability be increase from the cause set forth in the report of the secretary suggestion therefore that authority should be give to supply any temporary deficiency by the issue of a limited amount of treasury note be approve and accordingly recommend the passage of such a law as state in the report of the secretary the tariff of march|3,|1857 have be in operation for so short a period of time and under circumstance so unfavorable to a just development of result as a revenue measure that should regard as inexpedient at least for the present to undertake revision transmit herewith the report make to by and of the navy of the interior and of the|postmaster general all contain valuable and important information and suggestion which commend to the favorable consideration of congress have already recommend the raising of additional regiment and the report of the secretary of war present strong reason prove this increase of the army under exist circumstance to be indispensable would call the special attention of congress to the recommendation of the secretary of the navy in favor of the construction of small war steamer of light draft for some|year the government have be oblige on many occasion to hire such steamer from individual to supply press want at the present moment have no armed vessel in the navy which can penetrate the river of china have but few which can enter any of the harbor south of norfolk although|many|million of foreign and domestic commerce annually pass in and out of these harbor some of most valuable interest and most vulnerable point be thus leave expose this class of vessel of light draft great speed and heavy gun would be formidable in coast defense the cost of construction will not be great and will require but a comparatively small expenditure to keep in commission in time of peace will prove as effective as much large vessel and more useful of should be at every station where maintain a squadron and three|or|four should be constantly employ on atlantic and pacific coast economy utility and efficiency combine to recommend as almost indispensable of these small vessel would be of incalculable advantage to the naval service and the whole cost of construction would not exceed or each the report of the secretary of the interior be worthy of grave consideration treat of the numerous important and diversified branch of domestic administration intrust to by law among these the most prominent be the public land and relation with the indians system for the disposal of the public land originate with the father of the republic have be improve as experience point the way and gradually adapt to the growth and settlement of western|state and territories have work well in practice already states and territories have be carve out of these land and still of acre remain unsold what a boundless prospect this present to country of future prosperity and power have heretofore dispose of of the public land whilst the public land as a source of revenue be of great importance importance be far great as furnish home for a hardy and independent race of honest and industrious citizen who desire to subdue and cultivate the soil ought to be administer mainly with a view of promote this wise and benevolent policy in appropriate for any other purpose ought to use even great economy than if have be convert into money and the proceed be already in the public treasury to squander away this rich and noble inheritance which any people have ever enjoy upon object of doubtful constitutionality or expediency would be to violate of the most important trust ever commit to any people whilst do not deny to congress the power when act bona fide as a proprietor to give away portion of for the purpose of increase the value of the remainder yet consider the great temptation to abuse this power can not be too cautious in exercise actual settler under exist law be protect against other purchaser at the public sale in right of preemption to the extent of a quarter section or of land the remainder may then be dispose of at public or enter at private sale in unlimited quantity speculation have of late|year prevail to a great extent in the public land the consequence have be that large portion of have become the property of individual and company and thus the price be greatly enhance to those who desire to purchase for actual settlement in order to limit the area of speculation as much as possible the extinction of the indian title and the extension of the public survey ought only to keep pace with the tide of emigration if congress should hereafter grant alternate section to states or company as have do heretofore recommend that the intermediate section retain by the government should be subject to preemption by actual settler ought ever to be cardinal policy to reserve the public land as much as may be for actual settler and this at moderate price shall thus not only good promote the prosperity of the new states and territories and the power of the union but shall secure home for posterity for many generation the extension of limit have bring within jurisdiction many additional and populous tribe of indians a large proportion of which be wild untractable and difficult to control predatory and warlike in disposition and habit be impossible altogether to restrain from commit aggression on each other as well as upon frontier citizen and those emigrate to distant states and territories hence expensive military expedition be frequently necessary to overawe and chastise the more lawless and hostile the present system of make valuable present to influence to remain at peace have prove ineffectual be believe to be the well policy to colonize in suitable locality where can receive the rudiment of education and be gradually induce to adopt habit of industry so far as the experiment have be try have work well in practice and will doubtless prove to be less expensive than the present system the whole number of indians within territorial limit be believe to be from the good datum in the|interior|department about|325,000 the tribe of cherokees choctaws chickasaws and creeks settle in the territory set apart for west of arkansas be rapidly advance in education and in all the art of civilization and self government and may indulge the agreeable anticipation that at no very distant day will be incorporate into the union as of the sovereign states will be see from the report of the|postmaster general that the|post office|department still continue to depend on the treasury as have be compel to do for several|years|past for an important portion of the mean of sustain and extend operation rapid growth and expansion be show by a decennial statement of the number of post - office and the length of post - road commence with the|year|1827 in that|year there be post - office in in and in number in this|year post - office have be establish and discontinue leave a net increase of the postmaster of office be appoint by the president the length of post - road in be in in and in the|year|1857 there be of post - road include of railroad on which the mail be transport the expenditure of the|department|for|the|fiscal year end on the|30th|june,|1857 as adjust by the auditor amount to to defray these expenditure there be to the credit of the department on the|1st|july,|1856 the sum of the gross revenue of the|year include the annual allowance for the transportation of free mail matter produce and the remainder be supply by the appropriation from the treasury of grant by the act of congress approve august|18,|1856 and by the appropriation of make by the|act|of|march|3,|1857 leave to be carry to the credit of the department in the account of the|current|year commend to consideration the report of the department in relation to the establishment of the overland mail route from the|mississippi|river to san|francisco cal the route be select with full concurrence as the one in judgment best calculate to attain the important object contemplate by congress the late disastrous monetary revulsion may have good effect should cause both the government and the people to return to the practice of a wise and judicious economy both in public and private expenditure an overflow treasury have lead to habit of prodigality and extravagance in legislation have induce congress to make large appropriation to object for which never would have provide have be necessary to raise the amount of revenue require to meet by increase taxation or by loan be now compel to pause in career and to scrutinize expenditure with the utmost vigilance and in perform this duty pledge cooperation to the extent of constitutional competency ought to be observe at the same time that true public economy do not consist in withhold the mean necessary to accomplish important national object intrust to by the constitution and especially such as may be necessary for the common defense in the present crisis of the country be duty to confine appropriation to object of this character unless in case where justice to individual may demand a different course in all case care ought to be take that the money grant by congress shall be faithfully and economically apply under the|federal|constitution every bill which shall have pass the|house|of|representatives and the senate shall before become a law be approve and sign by the president and if not approve shall return with objection to that house in which shall have originate in order to perform this high and responsible duty sufficient time must be allow the president to read and examine every bill present to for approval unless this be afford the constitution become a dead letter in this particular and even worse become a means of deception constituent see the president 's approval and signature attach to each act of congress be induce to believe that have actually perform duty when in truth nothing be in many case more unfounded from the practice of congress such an examination of each bill as the constitution require have be render impossible the most important business of each session be generally crowd into last|hours and the alternative present to the president be either to violate the constitutional duty which owe to the people and approve bill which for want of time be impossible should have examine or by refusal to do this subject the country and individual to great loss and inconvenience besides a practice have grow up of late|year to legislate in appropriation bill at the|last|hours of the session on new and important subject this practice constrain the president either to suffer measure to become law which do not approve or to incur the risk of stop the wheel of the government by veto an appropriation bill formerly such bill be confine to specific appropriation for carry into effect exist law and the well establish policy of the country and little time be then requite by the president for examination for own part have deliberately determine that shall approve no bill which have not examine and will be a case of extreme and most urgent necessity which shall ever induce to depart from this rule therefore respectfully but earnestly recommend that the houses would allow the president at|least|two|days previous to the adjournment of each session within which no new bill shall be present to for approval under the exist joint rule be allow but this rule have be hitherto so constantly suspend in practice that important bill continue to be present to up till the very last moment of the session in a large majority of case no great public inconvenience can arise from the want of time to examine provision because the constitution have declare that if a bill be present to the president within the|last|ten|day of the session be not require to return either with an approval or with a veto in which case shall not be a law may then lie over and be take up and pass at the next session great inconvenience would only be experience in regard to appropriation bill but fortunately under

theconstitution be hear and instant submission follow own countrycould alone have exhibit so grand and strike a spectacle of the capacityof man for self government what a happy conception then be for congress to apply this simplerule that the will of the majority shall govern to the settlement ofthe question of domestic slavery in the territories congress be legislate slavery into any territory or state nor to exclude therefrom but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate theirdomestic institution in own way subject only to the constitutionof the united states as a natural consequence congress have also prescribe that when theterritory of kansas shall be admit as a state shall be receivedinto the union with or without slavery as constitution may prescribeat the time of admission a difference of opinion have arise inregard to the point of time when the people of a territory shall decidethis question for this be happily a matter of but little practical

that the geographical partiesto which have give birth so much dread by the|father|of|his country will speedily become extinct most happy will be for the country whenthe public mind shall be divert from this question to other of morepressing and practical importance throughout the whole progress of thisagitation which have scarcely know any intermission for more than twentyyear whilst have be productive of no positive good to any human beingit have be the prolific source of great evil to the master to the slave and to the whole country have alienate and estrange the people ofthe sister

soundsense and sober judgment of the people time be a great corrective politicalsubject which but a|few|years|ago excite and exasperate the public mindhave pass away and be now nearly forget but this question of domesticslavery be of far graver importance than any mere political question becauseshould the agitation continue may eventually endanger the personal safetyof a large portion of countryman where the institution exist in thatevent no form of government however admirable in and however productiveof material benefit can compensate for the loss of peace and domesticsecurity around the family altar let every union love man therefore exert good influence to suppress this agitation which since the recentlegislation of congress be without any legitimate object be an evil oman of the time that man have undertake to calculatethe mere material value of the union reason estimate have be presentedof the pecuniary profit and local advantage which would result to differentstate and section from dissolution and of the comparative injurieswhich such an event would inflict on other states and section even descendingto this low and narrow view of the mighty question all such calculationsare at fault the bare reference to a single consideration will be conclusiveon this point at present enjoy a free trade throughout extensiveand expand country such as the world have never witness this tradeis conduct on railroad and canal on noble river and arm of the sea which bind together the north and the south the east and the west ofour confederacy annihilate this trade arrest free progress by thegeographical line of jealous and hostile states and destroy the prosperityand onward march of the whole and every part and involve all in commonruin but such consideration important as be in sinkinto insignificance when reflect on the terrific evil which would resultfrom disunion to every portion of the confederacy to the north not morethan to the south to

government and union ever devise by man will not suffer toperish until shall have be peacefully instrumental by examplein the extension of civil and religious liberty throughout the world next in importance to the maintenance of the constitution and the unionis the duty of preserve the government free from the taint or even thesuspicion of corruption public virtue be the vital spirit of republic and history prove that when this have decay and the love of money hasusurpe place although the form of free government may remain fora season the substance have depart forever present financial condition be without a parallel in history nonation have ever before be embarrassed from too large a surplus in itstreasury this almost necessarily give birth to extravagant legislation produce wild scheme of expenditure and beget a race of speculatorsand jobber whose ingenuity be exert in contrive and promote expedientsto obtain public money the purity of official agent whether rightfullyor wrongfully be suspect and the character of the government suffersin the estimation of the people this be in a very great evil the natural mode of relief from this embarrassment be to appropriatethe surplus in the treasury to great national object for which a clearwarrant can be find in the constitution among these may mention theextinguishment of the public debt a reasonable increase of the navy whichis at present inadequate to the protection of vast tonnage afloat now great than that of any other nation as well as to the defense ofour extend seacoast be beyond all question the true principle that no more revenue oughtto be collect from the people than the amount necessary to defray theexpense of a wise economical and efficient administration of the government to reach this point be necessary to resort to a modification of thetariff and this have trust be accomplish in such a manner as todo as little injury as may have be practicable to domestic manufacture especially those necessary for the defense of the country any discriminationagainst a particular branch for the purpose of benefit favor corporation individual or interest would have be unjust to the rest of the communityand inconsistent with that spirit of fairness and equality which oughtto govern in the adjustment of a revenue tariff but the squandering of the public money sink into comparative insignificancea a temptation to corruption when compare with the squandering of thepublic land no nation in the tide of time have ever be bless with so rich andnoble an inheritance as enjoy in the

constitution and law to be placedon a perfect equality with native bear citizen and in this characterthey should ever be kindly recognize the|federal|constitution be a grant from the states to congress of certainspecific power and the question whether this grant should be liberallyor strictly construe have more or less divided political party from thebeginne without enter into the argument desire to state at thecommencement of administration that long experience and observationhave convince that a strict construction of the power of the governmentis the only true as well as the only safe theory of the constitution whenever in past history doubtful power have be exercise by congress these have never fail to produce injurious and unhappy consequence many such instance may be adduce if this be the proper occasion neither be necessary for the public service to strain the language constitution because all the great and useful power require fora successful administration of the government both in peace and in war have be grant either in express term or by the plain implication whilst deeply convinced of these truth yet consider clear thatunder the war make power congress may appropriate money toward the constructionof a military road when this be absolutely necessary for the defense ofany state or territory of the union against foreign invasion under theconstitution congress have power to declare war to raise and supportarmie to provide and maintain a navy and to call forth the militiato repel invasion thus endow in an ample manner with the war makingpower the corresponding duty be require that the|united|state shallprotect each of the states against invasion now how be possibleto afford this protection to california and pacific possession exceptby mean of a military road through the territories of the|united|state over which man and munition of war may be speedily transport from theatlantic states to meet and to repel the invader in the event of a warwith a naval power much strong than own should then have no otheravailable access to the|pacific|coast because such a power would instantlyclose the route across the isthmus of central|america be impossibleto conceive that whilst the constitution have expressly require congressto defend all the states should yet deny to by any fair construction the only possible mean by which of these state can be defend besides the government ever since origin have be in the constant practiceof construct military road may also be wise to consider whetherthe love for the union which now animate fellow citizen on the pacificcoast may not be impair by neglect or refusal to provide for in remote and isolated condition the only mean by which the powerof the states on this side of the|rocky|mountain can reach in sufficienttime to protect against invasion forbear for the present fromexpresse an opinion as to the wise and most economical mode in whichthe government can lend aid in accomplish this great and necessarywork believe that many of the difficulty in the way which now appearformidable will in a great degree vanish as soon as the near and bestroute shall have be satisfactorily ascertain may be proper that on this occasion should make some brief remarksin regard to right and duty as a member of the great family of nation in intercourse with there be some plain principle approvedby own experience from which should never depart ought to cultivatepeace commerce and friendship with all nation and this not merely asthe good mean of promote own material interest but in a spiritof

glory that whilst other nation have extend dominionsby the sword have never acquire any territory except by fair purchaseor as in the case of texas by the voluntary determination of a brave kindre and independent people to blend destiny with own even acquisition from mexico form no exception unwilling to takeadvantage of the fortune of war against a sister republic purchasedthese possession under the treaty of peace for a sum which be consideredat the time a fair equivalent past history forbid that shall inthe future acquire territory unless this be sanction by the law of justiceand honor act on this principle no nation will have a right to interfereor to complain if in the progress of event shall still further extendour possession hitherto in all acquisition the people under theprotection of the american flag have enjoy civil and religious liberty as well as equal and just law and have be content prosperous andhappy trade with the rest of the world have rapidly increase andthus every commercial nation have share largely in successful progress shall now proceed to take the oath prescribe by the constitution whilst humbly invoke the blessing of divine|providence on this greatpeople transcript fellow citizens of the senate and of the|house|of|representatives the constitution require that the president shall from time to time not only recommend to the consideration of congress such measure as may judge necessary and expedient but also that shall give information to of the state of the union to do this fully involve exposition of all matter in the actual condition of the country domestic or foreign which essentially concern the general welfare while perform constitutional duty in this respect the president do not speak merely to express personal conviction but as the executive minister of the government enable by position and call upon by official obligation to scan with an impartial eye the interest of the whole and of every part of the|united|state of the condition of the domestic interest of the union agriculture mine manufacture navigation and commerce be necessary only to say that the internal prosperity of the country continuous and steady advancement in wealth and population and in private as well as public well being attest the wisdom of institution and the predominant spirit of intelligence and patriotism which notwithstanding occasional irregularity of opinion or action result from popular freedom have distinguish and characterize the people of america in the brief interval between the termination of the last and the commencement of the present session of congress the public mind have be occupy with the care of select for another constitutional term the president and vice president of the|united|state the determination of the person who be of right or contingently to preside over the administration of the government be under system commit to the states and the people appeal to by voice pronounce in the form of law to call whomsoever will to the high post of chief|magistrate and thus be that as the senators represent the respective states of the union and the member of the|house|of|representative the several constituency of each state so the president represent the aggregate population of the|united|state election of be the explicit and solemn act of the sole sovereign authority of the union be impossible to misapprehend the great principle which by recent political action the people of the|united|state have sanction and announce have assert the constitutional equality of each and all of the|states|of|the|union|as|state have affirm the constitutional equality of each and all of the citizen of the|united|state as citizen whatever religion wherever birth or residence have maintain the inviolability of the constitutional right of the different section of the union and have proclaim devoted and unalterable attachment to the union and to the constitution as object of interest superior to all subject of local or sectional controversy as the safeguard of the right of all as the spirit and the essence of the liberty peace and greatness of the republic in do this have at the same time emphatically condemn the idea of organize in mere geographical party of marshal in hostile array toward each other the different part of the country north|or|south east or west scheme of this nature fraught with incalculable mischief and which the considerate sense of the people have reject could have have countenance in no part of the country have not be disguise by suggestion plausible in appearance act upon an excited state of the public mind induce by cause temporary in character and be to be hope transient in influence perfect liberty of association for political object and the wide scope of discussion be the received and ordinary condition of government in country institution frame in the spirit of confidence in the intelligence and integrity of the people do not forbid citizen either individually or associate together to attack by writing speech or any other method short of physical force the constitution and the very existence of the union under the shelter of this great liberty and protect by the law and usage of the government assail association have be form in some of the states of individual who pretend to seek only to prevent the spread of the institution of slavery into the present or future inchoate states|of|the|union be really inflame with desire to change the domestic institution of exist states to accomplish object dedicate to the odious task of depreciate the government organization which stand in way and of calumniate with indiscriminate invective not only the citizen of particular states with whose law find fault but all other of fellow citizen throughout the country who do not participate with in assault upon the constitution frame and adopt by father and claim for the privilege have secure and the blessing have confer the steady support and grateful reverence of child seek an object which well know to be a revolutionary be perfectly aware that the change in the relative condition of the white and black race in the slaveholde states which would promote be beyond lawful authority that to be a foreign object that can not be effect by any peaceful instrumentality of that for and the states of which be citizen the only path to accomplishment be through burn city and ravage field and slaughter population and all there be most terrible in foreign complicate with civil and servile war and that the first step in the attempt be the forcible disruption of a country embrace in broad bosom a degree of liberty and an amount of individual and public prosperity to which there be no parallel in history and substitute in place hostile government drive at once and inevitably into mutual devastation and fratricidal carnage transform the now peaceful and felicitous brotherhood into a vast permanent camp of armed man like the rival monarchy of europe and asia well know that such and such only be the mean and the consequence of plan and purpose endeavor to prepare the people of the|united|state for civil war by do everything in power to deprive the constitution and the law of moral authority and to undermine the fabric of the union by appeal to passion and sectional prejudice by indoctrinate people with reciprocal hatred and by educate to stand face to face as enemy rather than shoulder to shoulder as friend be by the agency of such unwarrantable interference foreign and domestic that the mind of many otherwise good citizen have be so inflame into the passionate condemnation of the domestic institution of the|southern|state as at length to pass insensibly to almost equally passion late hostility toward fellow citizen of those states and thus finally to fall into temporary fellowship with the avowed and active enemy of the constitution ardently attach to liberty in the abstract do not stop to consider practically how the object would attain can be accomplish nor to reflect that even if the evil be as great as deem have no remedy to apply and that can be only aggravate by violence and unconstitutional action a question which be of the most difficult of all the problem of social institution political economy and statesmanship treat with unreasoning intemperance of thought and language extreme beget extreme violent attack from the north find inevitable consequence in the growth of a spirit of angry defiance at the south thus in the progress of event have reach that consummation which the voice of the people have now so pointedly rebuke of the attempt of a portion of the states by a sectional organization and movement to usurp the control of confidently believe that the great body of those who inconsiderately take this fatal step be sincerely attach to the constitution and the union would upon deliberation shrink with unaffected horror from any conscious act of disunion or civil war but have enter into a path which lead nowhere unless be to civil war and disunion and which have no other possible outlet have proceed thus far in that direction in consequence of the successive stage of progress have consist of a series of secondary issue each of which profess to be confine within constitutional and peaceful limit but which attempt indirectly what few man be willing to do directly that is to act aggressively against the constitutional right of nearly|one half of the states in the long series of act of indirect aggression the first be the strenuous agitation by citizen of the|northern|state in congress and out of of the question of negro emancipation in the|southern|state the second step in this path of evil consist of act of the people of the|northern|state and in several instance of government aim to facilitate the escape of person hold to service in the|southern|states and to prevent extradition when reclaim accord to law and in virtue of express provision of the constitution to promote this object legislative enactment and other mean be adopt to take away or defeat right which the constitution solemnly guarantee in order to nullify the then exist act of congress concern the extradition of fugitive from service law be enact in many state forbid officer under the severest penalty to participate in the execution of any act of congress whatever in this way that system of harmonious cooperation between the authority of the|united|state and of the several states for the maintenance of common institution which exist in the|early|years of the republic be destroy conflict of jurisdiction come to be frequent and congress find compel for the support of the constitution and the vindication of power to authorize the appointment of new officer charge with the execution of act as if and the officer of the states be the minister respectively of foreign government in a state of mutual hostility rather than fellow magistrate of a common country peacefully subsist under the protection of well constitute union thus here also aggression be follow by reaction and the attack upon the constitution at this point do but serve to raise up new barrier for defense and security the third stage of this unhappy sectional controversy be in connection with the organization of territorial government and the admission of new states into the union when be propose to admit the|state|of|maine by separation of territory from that of massachusetts and the|state of missouri form of a portion of the territory cede by france to the|united|state representative in congress object to the admission of the latter unless with condition suit to particular view of public policy the imposition of such a condition be successfully resist but at the same period the question be present of impose restriction upon the residue of the territory cede by france that question be for the time dispose of by the adoption of a geographical line of limitation in this connection should not be forget that when france of own accord resolve for consideration of the most farsighted sagacity to cede louisiana to the|united|state and that accession be accept by the|united|state the latter expressly engage that the inhabitant of the cede territory shall be incorporate in and admit as soon as possible accord to the principle of the|federal|constitution to the enjoyment of all the right advantage and immunity of citizen of the|united|state and in the meantime shall be maintain and protect in the free enjoyment of liberty property and the religion which profess that be to say while remain in a territorial condition inhabitant be maintain and protect in the free enjoyment of liberty and property with a right then to pass into the condition of states on a footing of perfect equality with the original states the enactment which establish the restrictive geographical line be acquiesce in rather than approve by the|states|of|the|union stand on the statute book however for a|number|of|year and the people of the respective states acquiesce in the reenactment of the principle as apply to the|state of texas and be propose to acquiesce in further application to the territory acquire by the|united|state from mexico but this proposition be successfully resist by the representative from the|northern|state who regardless of the statute line insist upon apply restriction to the new territory generally whether lie north or south of thereby repeal as a legislative compromise and on the part of the north persistently violate the compact if compact there be thereupon this enactment cease to have bind virtue in any sense whether as respect the north or the south and so in effect be treat on the occasion of the admission of and the organization of the|territories|of|new|mexico utah and washington such be the state of this question when the time arrive for the organization of the|territories|of|kansas and nebraska in the progress of constitutional inquiry and reflection have now at length come to be see clearly that congress do not possess constitutional power to impose restriction of this character upon any present or future state of the union in a long series of decision on the full argument and after the most deliberate consideration the|supreme|court of the|united|state have finally determine this point in every form under which the question could arise whether as affect public or private right in question of the public domain of religion of navigation and of servitude the several states of the union be by force of the constitution coequal in domestic legislative power congress can not change a law of domestic relation in the|state|of|maine no more can in the|state of missouri any statute which propose to do this be a mere nullity take away no right confer none if remain on the statute book unrepeale remain there only as a monument of error and a beacon of warn to the legislator and the statesman to repeal will be only to remove imperfection from the statute without affect either in the sense of permission or of prohibition the action of the states or of citizen still when the nominal restriction of this nature already a dead letter in law be in term repeal by the last congress in a clause of the act organize the|territories|of|kansas and nebraska that repeal be make the occasion of a widespread and dangerous agitation be allege that the original enactment be a compact of perpetual moral obligation repeal constitute an odious breach of faith an act of congress while remain unrepealed more especially if be constitutionally valid in the judgment of those public functionary whose duty be to pronounce on that point be undoubtedly bind on the conscience of each good citizen of the republic but in what sense can be assert that the enactment in question be invest with perpetuity and entitle to the respect of a solemn compact between whom be the compact no distinct contend power of the government no separate section of the union treat as such enter into treaty stipulation on the subject be a mere clause of an act of congress and like any other controverted matter of legislation receive final shape and be pass by compromise of the conflicting opinion or sentiment of the member of congress but if have moral authority over man 's conscience to whom do this authority attach not to those of the north who have repeatedly refuse to confirm by extension and who have zealously strive to establish other and incompatible regulation upon the subject and if as thus appear the suppose compact have no obligatory force as to the north of course could not have have any as to the south for all such compact must be mutual and of reciprocal obligation have not unfrequently happen that lawgiver with undue estimation of the value of the law give or in the view of impart to peculiar strength make perpetual in term but can not thus bind the conscience the judgment and the will of those who may succeed invest with similar responsibility and clothe with equal authority more careful investigation may prove the law to be unsound in principle experience may show to be imperfect in detail and impracticable in execution and then both reason and right combine not merely to justify but to require repeal the constitution supreme as be over all the department of the government legislative executive and judicial be open to amendment by very term and congress or the states may in discretion propose amendment to solemn compact though in truth be between the sovereign states|of|the|union in the present instance a political enactment which have cease to have legal power or authority of any kind be repeal the position assume that congress have no moral right to enact such repeal be strange enough and singularly so in view of the fact that the argument come from those who openly refuse obedience to exist law of the land have the same popular designation and quality as compromise act nay more who unequivocally disregard and condemn the most positive and obligatory injunction of the constitution and seek by every mean within reach to deprive a portion of fellow citizen of the equal enjoyment of those right and privilege guarantee alike to all by the fundamental compact of union this argument against the repeal of the statute line in question be accompany by another of congenial character and equally with the former destitute of foundation in reason and truth be impute that the measure originate in the conception of extend the limit of slave labor beyond those previously assign to and that such be natural as well as intend effect and these baseless assumption be make in the|northern|state the ground of uncease assault upon constitutional right the repeal in term of a statute which be already obsolete and also null for unconstitutionality could have no influence to obstruct or to promote the propagation of conflicting view of political or social institution when the act organize the|territories|of|kansas and nebraska be pass the inherent effect upon that portion of the public domain thus open to legal settlement be to admit settler from all the|state of the union alike each with conviction of public policy and private interest there to find in discretion subject to such limitation as the constitution and act of congress may prescribe new states hereafter to be admit into the union be a free field open alike to all whether the statute line of assume restriction be repeal or not that repeal do not open to free competition of the diverse opinion and domestic institution a field which without such repeal would have be close against find that field of competition already open in fact and in law all the repeal do be to relieve the statute book of an objectionable enactment unconstitutional in effect and injurious in term to a large portion of the states be the fact that in all the unsettled region of the|united|state if emigration be leave free to act in this respect for without legal prohibition on either side slave labor will spontaneously go everywhere in preference to free labor be the fact that the peculiar domestic institution of the southern|states possess relatively so much of vigor that wheresoever an avenue be freely open to all the world will penetrate to the exclusion of those of the|northern|states be the fact that the former enjoy compare with the latter such irresistibly superior vitality independent of climate soil and all other accidental circumstance as to be able to produce the suppose result in spite of the assume moral and natural obstacle to accomplishment and of the more numerous population of the|northern|states the argument of those who advocate the enactment of new law of restriction and condemn the repeal of old one in effect aver that particular view of government have no self extend or self sustain power of own and will go nowhere unless force by act of congress and if congress do but pause for a moment in the policy of stern coercion if venture to try the experiment of leave man to judge for what institution will best suit if be not strain up to perpetual legislative exertion on this point if congress proceed thus to act in the very spirit of liberty be at once charge with aim to extend slave labor into all the new territories of the|united|state of course these imputation on the intention of congress in this respect conceive as be in prejudice and disseminate in passion be utterly destitute of any justification in the nature of thing and contrary to all the fundamental doctrine and principle of civil liberty and self government while therefore in general the people of the|northern|state have never at any time arrogate for the|federal|government the power to interfere directly with the domestic condition of person in the|southern|state but on the contrary have disavow all such intention and have shrink from conspicuous affiliation with those few who pursue fanatical object avowedly through the contemplate mean of revolutionary change of the government and with acceptance of the necessary consequence a civil and servile war yet many citizen have suffer to be draw into evanescent political issue of agitation after another appertain to the same set of opinion and which subside as rapidly as arise when come to be see as uniformly do that be incompatible with the compact of the constitution and the existence of the union thus when the act of some of the states to nullify the exist extradition law impose upon congress the duty of pass a new one the country be invite by agitator to enter into party organization for repeal but that agitation speedily cease by reason of the impracticability of object so when the statute restriction upon the institution of new states by a geographical line have be repeal the country be urge to demand restoration and that project also die almost with birth then follow the cry of alarm from the north against imputed southern encroachmeat which cry spring in reality from the spirit of revolutionary attack on the domestic institution of the south and after a troubled existence of a|few|month have be rebuke by the voice of a patriotic people of this last agitation lamentable feature be that be carry on at the immediate expense of the peace and happiness of the people of the|territory|of|kansas that be make the battlefield not so much of oppose faction or interest within as of the conflicting passion of the whole people of the|united|state revolutionary disorder in kansas have origin in project of intervention deliberately arrange by certain member of that congress which enact the law for the organization of the territory and when propagandist colonization of kansas have thus be undertake in section of the union for the systematic promotion of peculiar view of policy there ensue as a matter of course a counteraction with opposite view in other section of the union in consequence of these and other incident many act of disorder be undeniable have be perpetrate in kansas to the occasional interruption rather than the permanent suspension of regular government aggressive and most reprehensible incursion into the territory be undertake both in the north and the south and enter on northern border by the way of iowa as well as on the eastern by way of missouri and there have exist within a state of insurrection against the constitute authority not without countenance from inconsiderate person in each of the great section of the union but the difficulty in that territory have be extravagantly exaggerate for purpose of political agitation elsewhere the number and gravity of the act of violence have be magnify partly by statement entirely untrue and partly by reiterated account of the same rumor or fact thus the territory have be seemingly fill with extreme violence when the whole amount of such act have not be great than what occasionally pass before in single city to the regret of all good citizen but without be regard as of general or permanent political consequence imputed irregularity in the election have in kansas like occasional irregularity of the same description in the states be beyond the sphere of action of the executive but incident of actual violence or of organized obstruction of law pertinaciously renew from time to time have be meet as occur by such mean as be available and as the circumstance require and nothing of this character now remain to affect the general peace of the union the attempt of a part of the inhabitant of the territory to erect a revolutionary government though sedulously encourage and supply with pecuniary aid from active agent of disorder in some of the states have completely fail body of armed man foreign to the territory have be prevent from enter or compel to leave predatory band engage in act of rapine under cover of the exist political disturbance have be arrest or disperse and every well dispose person be now enable once more to devote in peace to the pursuit of prosperous industry for the prosecution of which undertake to participate in the settlement of the territory afford unmingle satisfaction thus to announce the peaceful condition of thing in kansas especially consider the mean to which be necessary to have recourse for the attainment of the end namely the employment of a part of the military force of the|united|state the withdrawal of that force from proper duty of defend the country against foreign foe or the savage of the frontier to employ for the suppression of domestic insurrection be when the exigency occur a matter of the most earnest solicitude on this occasion of imperative necessity have be do with the good result and satisfaction in the attainment of such result by such mean be greatly enhance by the consideration that through the wisdom and energy of the present executive of kansas and the prudence firmness and vigilance of the military officer on duty there tranquillity have be restore without drop of blood have be shed in accomplishment by the force of the|united|state the restoration of comparative tranquillity in that territory furnish the mean of observe calmly and appreciate at just value the event which have occur there and the discussion of which the government of the territory have be the subject perceive that controversy concern future domestic institution be inevitable that no human prudence no form of legislation no wisdom on the part of congress could have prevent be idle to suppose that the particular provision of organic law be the cause of agitation those provision be but the occasion or the pretext of an agitation which be inherent in the nature of thing congress legislate upon the subject in such term as be most consonant with the principle of popular sovereignty which underlie government could not have legislate otherwise without do violence to another great principle of institution the imprescriptible right of equality of the several states perceive also that sectional interest and party passion have be the great impediment to the salutary operation of the organic principle adopt and the chief cause of the successive disturbance in kansas the assumption that because in the organization of and kansas|congress abstain from impose restraint upon to which certain other territories have be subject therefore disorder occur in the latter territory be emphatically contradict by the fact that none have occur in the former those disorder be not the consequence in kansas of the freedom of self government concede to that territory by congress but of unjust interference on the part of person not inhabitant of the territory such interference wherever have exhibit by act of insurrectionary character or of obstruction to process of law have be repel or suppress by all the mean which the constitution and the law place in the hand of the executive in those part of the|united|state where by reason of the inflamed state of the public mind false rumor and misrepresentation have the great currency have be assume that be the duty of the executive not only to suppress insurrectionary movement in kansas but also to see to the regularity of local election need little argument to show that the president have no such power all government in the|united|state rest substantially upon popular election the freedom of election be liable to be impair by the intrusion of unlawful vote or the exclusion of lawful one by improper influence by violence or by fraud but the people of the|united|state be the all sufficient guardian of own right and to suppose that will not remedy in due season any such incident of civil freedom be to suppose to have cease to be capable of self government the president of the|united|state have not power to interpose in election to see to freedom to canvass vote or to pass upon legality in the territories any more than in the|state if have such power the government may be republican in form but would be a monarchy in fact and if have undertake to exercise in the case of kansas would have be justly subject to the charge of usurpation and of violation of the dear right of the people of the|united|state unwise law equally with irregularity at election be in period of great excitement the occasional incident of even the free and good political institution but all experience demonstrate that in a country like where the right of self constitution exist in the completest form the attempt to remedy unwise legislation by resort to revolution be totally out of place inasmuch as exist legal institution afford more prompt and efficacious mean for the redress of wrong confidently trust that now when the peaceful condition of kansas afford opportunity for calm reflection and wise legislation either the legislative assembly of the territory or congress will see that no act shall remain on statute book violative of the provision of the constitution or subversive of the great object for which that be ordain and establish and will take all other necessary step to assure to inhabitant the enjoyment without obstruction or abridgment of all the constitutional right privilege and immunity of citizen of the|united|state as contemplate by the organic law of the territory full information in relation to recent event in this territory will be find in the document communicate herewith from the departments|of|state|and|war

premium have be discharge reduce the debt to all which may be pay within a|year without embarrass the public service but be not yet due and only redeemable at the option of the holder can not be press to payment by the government on examine the expenditure of will be see that the average deduct payment on account of the public debt and pay by treaty to mexico have be but about|$48,000,000 be believe that under an economical administration of the government the average expenditure for the ensue five|years will not exceed that sum unless extraordinary occasion for increase should occur the act grant bounty land will soon have be execute while the extension of frontier settlement will cause a continue demand for land and augmented receipt probably from that source these consideration will justify a reduction of the revenue from custom so as not to exceed or dollar think the exigency for such reduction be imperative and again urge upon the consideration of congress the amount of reduction as well as the manner of effect be question of great and general interest be essential to industrial enterprise and the public prosperity as well as the dictate of obvious justice that the burden of taxation be make to rest as equally as possible upon all class and all section and interest of the country have heretofore recommend to consideration the revision of the revenue law prepare under the direction of the secretary of the treasury and also legislation upon some special question affect the business of that department more especially the enactment of a law to punish the

all person who may become possess of public money by deposit or otherwise and who shall refuse or neglect on due demand to pay the same into the treasury invite attention anew to each of these object the army during the|past|year have be so constantly employ against hostile indians in various quarter that can scarcely be say with propriety of language to have be a peace establishment duty have be

indians of the|territories|of|washington and oregon at time threaten the devastation of the newly form settlement of that remote portion of the country from recent information be permit to hope that the energetic and successful operation conduct there will prevent such combination in future and secure to those territories an opportunity to make steady progress in the development of agricultural and mineral resource legislation have be recommend by on previous occasion to cure defect in the exist organization and to increase the efficiency of the army and further observation have but serve to confirm in the view then express and to enforce on mind the conviction that such measure be not only proper but necessary have in addition to invite the attention of congress to a change of policy in the distribution of troop and to the necessity of provide a more rapid increase of the military armament for detail of these and other subject relate to the army refer to the report of the secretary of war the condition of the navy be not merely satisfactory but exhibit the most gratifying evidence of increase vigor as be comparatively small be more important that should be as complete as

various quality the navy have make great progress within the|last|few|year the execution of the law of congress of february|28,|1855 to promote the efficiency of the navy have be attend by the most advantageous result the law for promote discipline among the man be find convenient and salutary the system of grant an honorable discharge to faithful seaman on the expiration of the period of

incorporate into the service a large number of countryman hitherto so difficult to procure several|hundred american boy be now on a|three|years ' cruise in national vessel and will return well train

be to secure for the benefit of all nation the neutrality and the common use of any transit way or interoceanic communication across the isthmus of panama which may be open within the limit of central|america the pretension subsequently assert by great|britain to dominion or control over territory in or near of the route those of nicaragua and honduras be deem by the|united|state not merely incompatible with the main object of the treaty but oppose even to express stipulation occasion of controversy on this point have be remove by an additional treaty which minister at london have conclude and which will be immediately submit to the senate for consideration should the propose supplemental arrangement be concur in by all the party to be affect by the object contemplate by the

those of the|preceding|year by nearly|$7,000,000 and the import therefrom during the same period amount to more|than|twenty one|million an increase of six|million upon those of the|previous|year the improved condition of this branch of commerce be mainly attributable to the above mention treaty provision be make in the first article of that treaty for a commission to designate the mouth of river to which the common right of fishery on the coast of the|united|state and the|british|province be not to extend this commission have be employ a part of season but without much progress in accomplish the object for which be institute in consequence of a serious difference of opinion between the commissioner not only as to the precise point where the river terminate but in many instance as to what constitute a river these difficulty however may be overcome by resort to the umpirage provide for by the treaty the effort perseveringly prosecute since the commencement of administration to relieve trade to the baltic from the exaction of sound due by denmark have not yet be attend with success other government have also seek to obtain a like relief to commerce and denmark be thus induce to propose an arrangement to all the european power interested in the subject and the manner in which proposition be receive warrant to believe that a satisfactory arrangement with could soon be conclude make a strong appeal to this government for temporary suspension of definite action on part in consideration of the embarrassment which may result to european negotiation by an immediate adjustment of the question with the|united|state this request have be accede to upon the condition that the sum collect after the|16th|of|june|last and until next from vessel and cargo belong to merchant be to be consider as pay under protest and subject to future adjustment there be reason to believe that an arrangement between denmark and the maritime power of europe on the subject will be soon conclude and that the pende negotiation with the|united|state may then be resume and terminate in a satisfactory manner with spain no new difficulty have arise nor have much progress be make in the adjustment of pende one negotiation enter into for the purpose of relieve commercial intercourse with the island of cuba of some of burden and provide for the more speedy settlement of local dispute grow out of that intercourse have not yet be attend with any result soon after the commencement of the late war in europe this government submit to the consideration of all maritime nation principle for the security of neutral commerce that the neutral flag should cover enemy ' good except article contraband of war and the other that neutral property on board merchant vessel of belligerent should be exempt from condemnation with the exception of contraband article these be not present as new rule of international law have be generally claim by neutral though not always admit by belligerent of the party to the war russia as well as several neutral power promptly accede to these proposition and the other principal belligerent great|britain and france have consent to observe for the present occasion a favorable opportunity seem to be present for obtain a general recognition of both in europe and america but great|britain and france in common with most of the|states|of|europe while forbear to reject do not affirmatively act upon the overture of the|united|state while the question be in this position the representative of russia france great|britain austria prussia sardinia and turkey assemble at paris take into consideration the subject of maritime right and put forth a declaration contain the principle which this government have submit nearly|two|year before to the consideration of maritime power and add thereto the following proposition privateering be and remain abolish and blockade in order to be bind must be effective that be to say maintain by a force sufficient really to prevent access to the coast of the enemy and to the declaration thus compose of point of which have already be propose by the|united|state this government have be invite to accede by all the power represent at paris except great|britain and turkey to the last of the additional proposition that in relation to blockade there can certainly be no objection be merely the definition of what shall constitute the effectual investment of a blockaded place a definition for which this government have always contend claim indemnity for loss where a practical violation of the rule thus define have be injurious to commerce as to the remain article of the declaration of the conference of paris that privateering be and remain abolish certainly can not ascribe to the power represent in the conference of paris any but liberal and philanthropic view in the attempt to change the unquestionable rule of maritime law in regard to privateering proposition be doubtless intend to imply approval of the principle that private property upon the ocean although may belong to the citizen of a belligerent state should be exempt from capture and have that proposition be so frame as to give full effect to the principle would have receive ready assent on behalf of the|united|state but the measure propose be inadequate to that purpose be true that if adopt private property upon the ocean would be withdraw from mode of plunder but leave expose meanwhile to another mode which could be use with increase effectiveness the aggressive capacity of great naval power would be thereby augment while the defensive ability of other would be reduce though the surrender of the mean of prosecute hostility by employ privateer as propose by the conference of paris be mutual in term yet in practical effect would be the relinquishment of a right of little value to class of state but of essential importance to another and a far large class ought not to have be anticipate that a measure so inadequate to the accomplishment of the propose object and so unequal in operation would receive the assent of all maritime power private property would be still leave to the depredation of the public armed cruiser have express a readiness on the part of this government to accede to all the principle contain in the declaration of the conference of paris provide that the one relate to the abandonment of privateering can be so amend as to effect the object for which as be presume be intend the immunity of private property on the ocean from hostile capture to effect this object be propose to add to the declaration that privateering be and remain abolish the follow amendment and that the private property of subject and citizen of a belligerent on the high sea shall be exempt from seizure by the public armed vessel of the other belligerent except be contraband this amendment have be present not only to the power which have ask assent to the declaration to abolish privateering but to all other maritime state thus far have not be reject by any and be favorably entertain by all which have make any communication in reply several of the government regard with favor the proposition of the|united|state have delay definitive action upon only for the purpose of consult with other party to the conference of paris have the satisfaction of state however that the emperor of russia have entirely and explicitly approve of that modification and will cooperate in endeavor to obtain the assent of other power and that assurance of a similar purport have be receive in relation to the disposition of the emperor of the french the present aspect of this important subject allow to cherish the hope that a principle so humane in character so just and equal in operation so essential to the prosperity of commercial nation and so consonant to the sentiment of this enlighten period of the world will command the approbation of all maritime power and thus be incorporate into the code of international law view on the subject be more fully set forth in the reply of the secretary of state a copy of which be herewith transmit to the communication on the subject make to this government especially to the communication of france the government of the|united|state have at all time regard with friendly interest the other states|of|america formerly like this country european colony and now independent member of the great family of nation but the unsettled condition of some of distract by frequent revolution and thus incapable of regular and firm internal administration have tend to embarrass occasionally public intercourse by reason of wrong which citizen suffer at hand and which be slow to redress unfortunately be against the|republic|of|mexico with which be special desire to maintain a good understanding that such complaint be most numerous and although earnestly urge upon attention have not as yet receive the consideration which this government have a right to expect while reparation for past injury have be withhold other have be add the political condition of that country however have be such as to demand forbearance on the part of the|united|state shall continue effort to procure for the wrong of citizen that redress which be indispensable to the continue friendly association of the republics the peculiar condition of affair in nicaragua in the early part of the|present|year render important that this government should have diplomatic relation with that state through territory have be open of the principal thoroughfare across the isthmus connect north|and|south|america on which a vast amount of property be transport and to which citizen resort in great number in pass between the atlantic and pacific coast of the|united|state the protection of both require that the exist power in that state should be regard as a responsible government and minister be accordingly receive but remain here only a short time soon thereafter the political affair of nicaragua undergo unfavorable change and become involved in much uncertainty and confusion diplomatic representative from contend party have be recently send to this government but with the imperfect information possess be not possible to decide which be the government de and await further development have refuse to receive either question of the most serious nature be pende between the|united|state and the|republic|of|new|granada the government of that republic undertake a year since to impose tonnage duty on foreign vessel in port but the purpose be resist by this government as be contrary to exist treaty stipulation with the|united|state and to right confer by charter upon the|panama|railroad|company and be accordingly refurbish at that time be admit that vessel be entitle to be exempt from tonnage duty in the free port of panama and aspinwall but the purpose have be recently revive on the part of new|granada by the enactment of a law to subject vessel visit port to the tonnage duty of per ton and although the law have not be put in force yet the right to enforce be still asserted and may at any time be act on by the government of that republic the congress of new granada have also enact a law during the|last|year which levy a tax of on every pound of mail matter transport across the isthmus the sum thus require to be pay on the mail of the|united|state would be nearly|$2,000,000 annually in addition to the large sum payable by contract to the|panama|railroad|company if the only objection to this exaction be the exorbitancy of amount could not be submit to by the|united|state the imposition of however would obviously contravene treaty with new|granada and infringe the contract of that republic with the|panama|railroad|company the law provide for this tax be by term to take effect on the|1st|of|september last but the local authority on the isthmus have be induce to suspend execution and to await further instruction on the subject from the government of the republic be not yet advise of the determination of that government if a measure so extraordinary in character and so clearly contrary to treaty stipulation and the contract right of the|panama|railroad|company compose mostly of american citizen should be persist in will be the duty of the|united|state to resist execution regret exceedingly that occasion exist to invite attention to a subject of still graver import in relation with the|republic|of|new|granada on the|15th|day|of|april last a riotous assemblage of the inhabitant of panama commit a violent and outrageous attack on the premise of the railroad company and the passenger and other person in or near the same involve the death of several citizen of the|united|state the pillage of many other and the destruction of a large amount of property belong to the railroad company cause full investigation of that event to be make and the result show satisfactorily that complete responsibility for what occur attache to the government of new granada have therefore demand of that government that the perpetrator of the wrong in question should be punish that provision should be make for the family of citizen of the|united|state who be kill with full indemnity for the property pillage or destroy the present condition of the|isthmus|of|panama in so far as regard the security of person and property pass over require serious consideration recent incident tend to show that the local authority can not be rely on to maintain the public peace of panama and there be just ground for apprehension that a portion of the inhabitant be meditate further outrage without adequate measure for the security and protection of person or property have be take either by or by the|general|government|of|new|granada under the guaranty of treaty citizen of the|united|state have by the outlay of several|million|dollars construct a railroad across the isthmus and have become the main route between atlantic and pacific possession over which multitude of citizen and a vast amount of property be constantly pass to the security and protection of all which and the continuance of the public advantage involve be impossible for the government of the|united|state to be indifferent have deem the danger of the recurrence of scene of lawless violence in this|quarter so imminent as to make duty to station a part of naval force in the harbor of panama and aspinwall in order to protect the person and property of the citizen of the|united|state in those port and to insure to safe passage across the isthmus and would in judgment be unwise to withdraw the naval force now in those port until by the spontaneous action of the|republic|of|new|granada or otherwise some adequate arrangement shall have be make for the protection and security of a line of interoceanic communication so important at this time not to the|united|state only but to all other maritime state both of europe and america meanwhile negotiation have be institute by mean of a special commission to obtain from new|granada full indemnity for injury sustain by citizen on the isthmus and satisfactory security for the general interest of the|united|state in address to last annual message the occasion seem to an appropriate one to express congratulation in view of the peace greatness and felicity which the|united|stat now possess and enjoy to point to the state of the various departments|of|the|government and of all the great branch of the public service civil and military in order to speak of the intelligence and the integrity which pervade the whole would be to indicate but imperfectly the administrative condition of the country and the beneficial effect of that on the general welfare nor would suffice to say that the nation be actually at peace at home and abroad that industrial interest be prosperous that the canvas of mariner whiten every sea and the plow of husbandman be march steadily onward to the bloodless conquest of the continent that city and populous state be spring up as if by enchantment from the bosom of oar western wild and that the courageous energy of people be make of these|united|states the great republic of the world these result have not be attain without pass through trial and peril by experience of which and thus only nation can harden into manhood forefather be train to the wisdom which conceive and the courage which achieve independence by the circumstance which surround and be thus make capable of the creation of the republic devolve on the next generation to consolidate the work of the revolution to deliver the country entirely from the influence of conflict transatlantic partiality or antipathy which attach to colonial and revolutionary history and to organize the practical operation of the constitutional and legal institution of the union to of this generation remain the not less noble task of maintain and extend the national power have at length reach that stage of country 's career in which the danger to be encounter and the exertion to be make be the incident not of weakness but of strength in foreign relation have to attemper power to the less happy condition of other republics in america and to place in the calmness and conscious dignity of right by the side of the great and wealthy of the|empires|of|europe in domestic relation have to guard against the shock of the discontent the ambition the interest and the exuberant and therefore sometimes irregular impulse of opinion or of action which be the natural product of the present political elevation the self reliance and the restless spirit of enterprise of the people of the|united|state shall prepare to surrender the executive trust to successor and retire to private life with sentiment of profound gratitude to the good providence which during the period of administration have vouchsafe to carry the country through many difficulty domestic and foreign and which enable to contemplate the spectacle of amicable and respectful relation between our and all other government and the establishment of constitutional order and tranquillity throughout the union transcript fellow citizens of the senate and house|of|representatif in consequence of the failure of congress at recent session to make provision for the support of the army become imperatively incumbent on to exercise the power which the constitution confer on the executive for extraordinary occasion and promptly to convene the houses in order to afford an opportunity of reconsider a subject of such vital interest to the peace and welfare of the union with the exception of a partial authority vest by law in the secretary of war to contract for the supply of clothing and subsistence the army be wholly dependent on the appropriation annually make by congress the omission of congress to act in this respect before the termination of the|fiscal|year have already cause embarrassment to the service which be overcome only in expectation of appropriation before the close of the|present|month if the requisite fund be not speedily provide the executive will no longer be able to furnish the transportation equipment and munition which be essential to the effectiveness of a military force in the field with no provision for the pay of troop the contract of enlistment would be break and the army must in effect be disband the consequence of which would be so disastrous as to demand all possible effort to avert the calamity be not merely that the officer and enlisted man of the army be to be thus deprive of the pay and emolument to which be entitle by stand law that the construction of arm at the public armory the repair and construction of ordnance at the arsenal and the manufacture of military clothing and camp equipage must be discontinue and the person connect with this branch of the public service thus be deprive suddenly of the employment essential to subsistence nor be merely the waste consequent on the force abandonment of the seaboard fortification and of the interior military post and other establishment and the enormous expense of recruit and reorganize the army and again distribute over the vast region which now occupy these be evil which may be true be repair hereafter by taxis impose on the country but other evil be involve which no expenditure however lavish could remedy in comparison with which local and personal injury or interest sink into insignificance a great part of the army be situate on the remote frontier or in the desert and mountain of the interior to discharge large body of man in such place without the mean of regain home and where few if any could obtain subsistence by honest industry would be to subject to suffering and temptation with disregard of justice and right most derogatory to the government in the|territories|of|washington and oregon numerous band of indians be in arm and be wag a war of extermination against the white inhabitant and although troop be actively carry on the campaign have no intelligence as yet of a successful result on the western plain notwithstanding the impose display of military force recently make there and the chastisement inflict on the rebellious tribe other far from be dismay have manifest hostile intention and be guilty of outrage which if not design to provoke a conflict serve to show that the apprehension of be insufficient wholly to restrain vicious propensity a strong force in the|state|of|texas have produce a temporary suspension of hostility there but in new|mexico incessant activity on the part of the troop be require to keep in check the marauding tribe which infest that territory the hostile indians have not be remove from the|state|of|florida and the withdrawal of the troop therefrom leave that object unaccomplished would be most injurious to the inhabitant and a breach of the positive engagement of the|general|government to refuse supply to the army therefore be to compel the complete cessation of all operation and practical disbandment and thus to invite horde of predatory savage from the western plain and the|rocky|mountain to spread devastation along a frontier of more|than|4,000|miles in extent and to deliver up the sparse population of a vast tract of country to rapine and murder such in substance would be the direct and immediate effect of the refusal of congress for the first time in the history of the government to grant supply for the maintenance of the army the inevitable waste of million of public treasure the infliction of extreme wrong upon all person connect with the military establishment by service employment or contract the recall of force from the field the fearful sacrifice of life and incalculable destruction of property on the remote frontier the striking of national flag on the battlement of the fortress which defend maritime city against foreign invasion the violation of the public honor and good faith and the discredit of the|united|state in the eye of the civilized world confidently trust that these consideration and other appertain to the domestic peace of the country which can not fail to suggest to every patriotic mind will on reflection be duly appreciate by both houses of congress and induce the enactment of the requisite provision of law for the support of the|army|of|the|united|state transcript by the president of a proclamation whereas indication exist that public tranquillity and the supremacy of law in the|territory|of|kansas be endanger by the reprehensible act or purpose of person both within and without the same who propose to direct and control political organization by force

provide arm for the same purpose and further appear that combination within the territory be endeavor by the agency of emissary and otherwise to induce individual states|of|the|union to intervene in the affair thereof in violation of the|united|state and whereas all such plan for the determination of the future institution of the territory if carry into action from within the same will constitute the fact of insurrection and if from without that of invasive aggression and will in either case justify and require the forcible interposition of the whole power of the|general|government as well to maintain the law of the territory as those of the union now therefore president of the|united|state do issue this proclamation to command all person engage in unlawful combination against the

the grave exigency of the case appear to require a brief exposition of the circumstance refer to and of cause will be necessary to the full understanding of the recommendation which be propose to submit the act to organize the|territories|of|nebraska and kansas be a manifestation of the legislative opinion of congress on great point of constitutional construction that the designation of the boundary of a new territory and provision for political organization and administration as a territory be measure which of right fall within the power of the|general|government and the other that the inhabitant of any such territory consider as an inchoate state be entitle in the exercise of self government to determine for what shall be own domestic institution subject only to the constitution and the law duly enact by congress under and to the power of the exist states to decide accord to the provision and principle of the constitution at what time the territory shall be receive as a state into the union such be the great political right which be solemnly declare and affirm by that act base upon this theory the act of congress define for each territory the outline of republican government distribute public authority among lawfully create agent executive judicial and legislative to be appoint either by the|general|government or by the territory the legislative function be intrust to a council and a house of representative duly elect and empower to enact all the local law which may deem essential to prosperity happiness and good government act in the same spirit congress also define the person who be in the first instance to be consider as the people of each territory enact that every free white male inhabitant of the same above the|age|of|21|year be an actual resident thereof and possess the qualification hereafter describe should be entitle to vote at the first election and be eligible to any office within the territory but that the qualification of voter and hold office at all subsequent election should be such as may be prescribe by the legislative assembly provide however that the right of suffrage and of hold office should be exercise only by citizen of the|united|state and those who should have declare on oath intention to become such and have take an oath to support the|united|state and the provision of the act and provide further that no officer soldier seaman or marine or other person in the army or navy of the|united|state or attach to troop in service should be allow to vote or hold office in either territory by reason of be on service therein such of the public officer of the territories as by the provision of the act be to be appoint by the|general|government include the governor be appoint and commission in due season the law have be enact on the|30th|of|may,|1854 and the commission of the governor of the|territory|of|nebraska be date on the|2d|day|of|august,|1854 and of the|territory|of|kansas on the|29th|day|of|june,|1854 among the duty impose by the act on the governor be that of direct and superintend the political organization of the respective territories the governor of kansas be require to cause a census or enumeration of the inhabitant and qualified voter of the several county and district of the territory to be take by such person and in such mode as may designate and appoint to appoint and direct the time and place of hold the first election and the manner of conduct both as to the person to superintend such election and the return thereof to declare the number of the member of the council and the house of representative for each county or district to declare what person may appear to be duly elect and to appoint the time and place of the first meeting of the legislative assembly in substance the same duty be devolve on the governor of nebraska while by this act the principle of constitution for each of the territories be and the same and the detail of organic legislation regard both be as nearly as could be identical and while the|territory|of|nebraska be tranquilly and successfully organize in the due course of law and first legislative assembly meet on the|16th|of|january,|1855 the organization of kansas be long delay and have be attend with serious difficulty and embarrassment partly the consequence of local maladministration and partly of the unjustifiable interference of the inhabitant of some of the states foreign by residence interest and right to the territory the governor of the|territory|of|kansas commission as before state on the|29th|of|june,|1854 do not reach the designate seat of government until the 7th of the ensue october and even then fail to make the first step in legal organization that of order the census or enumeration of inhabitant until so|late|a|day that the election of the member of the legislative assembly do not take place until the|30th|of|march,|1855 nor meeting until the|2d of july,|1855 so that for a|year after the territory be constitute by the act of congress and the officer to be appoint by the|federal|executive have be commission be without a complete government without any legislative authority without local law and of course without the ordinary guaranty of peace and public order in other respect the governor instead of exercise constant vigilance and put forth all energy to prevent or counteract the tendency to illegality which be prone to exist in all imperfectly organized and newly associate community allow attention to be divert from official obligation by other object and set an example of the violation of law in the performance of act which render duty in the sequel to remove from the office of chief executive magistrate of the territory before the requisite preparation be accomplish for election of a territorial legislature an election of delegate|to|congress have be hold in the territory on the|29th|day|of|november,|1854 and the delegate take seat in the|house|of|representatives without challenge arrangement have be perfect by the governor so that the election for member of the legislative assembly may be hold in the several precinct at the same time as for delegate to congress any question appertain to the qualification of the person vote as people of the territory would have pass necessarily and at once under the supervision of congress as the judge of the validity of the return of the delegate and would have be determine before conflicting passion have become inflame by time and before opportunity could have be afford for systematic interference of the people of individual states this interference in so far as concern primary cause and immediate commencement be of the incident of that pernicious agitation on the subject of the condition of the colored person hold to service in some of the states which have so long disturb the repose of country and excited individual otherwise patriotic and law abiding to toil with misdirect zeal in the attempt to propagate social theory by the perversion and abuse of the power of congress the person and the party whom the tenor of the act to organize the|territories|of|nebraska and kansas thwart in the endeavor to impose through the agency of congress particular view of social organization on the people of the future new states now perceive that the policy of leave the inhabitant of each state to judge for in this respect be ineradicably root in the conviction of the people of the union then have recourse in the pursuit of general object to the extraordinary measure of propagandist colonization of the|territory|of|kansas to prevent the free and natural action of inhabitant in internal organization and thus to anticipate or to force the determination of that question in this inchoate state with such view association be organize in some of the states and purpose be proclaim through the press in language extremely irritating and offensive to those of whom the colonist be to become the neighbor those design and act have the necessary consequence to awaken emotion of intense indignation in states near to the|territory|of|kansas and especially in the adjoin state of missouri whose domestic peace be thus the most directly endanger but be far from justify the illegal and reprehensible countermovement which ensue under these inauspicious circumstance the primary election for member of the legislative assembly be hold in most if not all of the precinct at the time and the place and by the person designate and appoint by the governor accord to law angry accusation that illegal vote have be poll abound on all side and imputation be make both of fraud and violence but the governor in the exercise of the power and the discharge of the duty confer and impose by law on alone officially receive and consider the return declare a large majority of the member of the council and the house of representative duly elect withhold certificate from other because of alleged illegality of vote appoint a new election to supply the place of the person not certify and thus at length in all the form of statute and with own official authentication complete legality be give to the first legislative assembly of the territory those decision of the return officer and of the governor be final except that by the parliamentary usage of the country apply to the organic law may be concede that each house of the assembly must have be competent to determine in the last resort the qualification and the election of member the subject be by nature one appertain exclusively to the jurisdiction of the local authority of the territory whatever irregularity may have occur in the election seem too late now to raise that question at all event be a question as to which neither now nor at any previous time have the least possible legal authority be possess by the president of the|united|state for all present purpose the legislative body thus constitute and elect be the legitimate legislative assembly of the territory accordingly the governor by proclamation convene the assembly thus elect to meet at a place call pawnee|city the house meet and be duly organize in the ordinary parliamentary form each send to and receive from the governor the official communication usual on such occasion an elaborate message open the session be communicate by the governor and the general business of legislation be enter upon by the legislative assembly but after a|few|days the assembly resolve to adjourn to another place in the territory a law be accordingly pass against the consent of the governor but in due form otherwise to remove the seat of government temporarily to the|"shawnee|manual|labor|school or mission and thither the assembly proceed after this receive a bill for the establishment of a ferry at the town of kickapoo the governor refuse to sign and by special message assign for reason of refusal not anything objectionable in the bill nor any pretense of the illegality or incompetency of the assembly as such but only the fact that the assembly have by act transfer the seat of government temporarily from pawnee|city to the|shawnee|mission for the same reason continue to refuse to sign other bill until in the course of a|few|day by official message communicate to the assembly the fact that have receive notification of the termination of function as governor and that the duty of the office be legally devolve on the secretary of the territory thus to the last recognize the body as a duly elect and constitute legislative assembly will be perceive that if any constitutional defect attach to the legislative act of the assembly be not pretend to consist in irregularity of election or want of qualification of the member but only in the change of place of session however trivial this objection may seem to be require to be consider because upon be round all that superstructure of act plainly against law which now threaten the peace not only of the|territory|of|kansas but of the union such an objection to the proceeding of the legislative assembly be of exceptionable origin for the reason that by the express term of the organic law the seat of government of the territory be locate temporarily at fort|leavenworth and yet the governor remain there less|than|two|month and of own discretion transfer the seat of government to the|shawnee|mission where in fact be at the time the assembly be call to meet at pawnee|city if the governor have any such right to change temporarily the seat of government still more have the legislative assembly the objection be of exceptionable origin for the further reason that the place indicate by the governor without have any exclusive claim of preference in be a propose town site only which and other be attempt to locate unlawfully upon land within a military reservation and for participation in which illegal act the commandant of the post a superior officer in the army have be dismiss by sentence of court martial nor be easy to see why the legislative assembly may not with propriety pass the territorial act transfer sitting to the|shawnee|mission if could not that must be on account of some prohibitory or incompatible provision of act of congress but no such provision exist the organic act as already quote say the seat of government be hereby locate temporarily at fort|leavenworth and then provide that certain of the public building there may be occupy and use under the direction of the governor and legislative assembly these expression may possibly be construe to imply that when in a previous section of the act be enact that the first legislative assembly shall meet at such place and on such|day as the governor shall appoint the word place mean place at fort|leavenworth not place anywhere in the territory if so the governor would have be the first to err in this matter not only in have remove the seat of government to the|shawnee|mission but in again remove to pawnee|city if there be any departure from the letter of the law therefore be in both instance but however this may be be most unreasonable to suppose that by the term of the organic act congress intend to do impliedly what have not do expressly that is to forbid to the legislative assembly the power to choose any place may see fit as the temporary seat of deliberation that be prove by the significant language of of the subsequent act of congress on the subject that of march|3,|1855 -which in make appropriation for public building of the territory enact that the same shall not be expend until the legislature of say territory shall have fix by law the permanent seat of government congress in these expression do not profess to be grant the power to fix the permanent seat of government but recognize the power as already grant but how undoubtedly by the comprehensive provision of the organic act which declare that the legislative power of the territory shall extend to all rightful subject of legislation consistent with the|united|state and the provision of this act if in view of this act the legislative assembly have the large power to fix the permanent seat of government at any place in discretion of course by the same enactment have the less and the include power to fix temporarily nevertheless the allegation that the act of the legislative assembly be illegal by reason of this removal of place of session be bring forward to justify the first great movement in disregard of law within the territory of the act of the legislative assembly provide for the election of a delegate to the present congress and a delegate be elect under that law but subsequently to this a portion of the people of the territory proceed without authority of law to elect another delegate follow upon this movement be another and more important of the same general character person confessedly not constitute the body politic or all the inhabitant but merely a party of the inhabitant and without law have undertake to summon a convention for the purpose of transform the territory into a state and have frame a constitution adopt and under elect a governor and other officer and a representative to congress in extenuation of these illegal act be allege that michigan and other be self organize and as such be admit into the union without a previous enable act of congress be true that while in a majority of case a previous act of congress have be pass to authorize the territory to present as a state and that this be deem the most regular course yet such an act have not be hold to be indispensable and in some case the territory have proceed without and have nevertheless be admit into the union as a state lie with congress to authorize beforehand or to confirm afterwards in discretion but in no instance have a state be admit upon the application of person act against authority duly constitute by act of congress in every case be the people of the territory not a party among who have the power to form a constitution and ask for admission as a state no principle of public law no practice or precedent under the|united|state no rule of reason right or common sense confer any such power as that now claim by a mere party in the territory in fact what have be do be of revolutionary character be avowedly so in motive and in aim as respect the local law of the territory will become treasonable insurrection if reach the length of organize resistance by force to the fundamental or any other federal law and to the authority of the|general|government in such an event the path of duty for the executive be plain the constitution require to take care that the law of the|united|state be faithfully execute if be oppose in the|territory|of|kansas may and should place at the disposal of the marshal any public force of the|united|state which happen to be within the jurisdiction to be use as a portion of the posse comitatus and if that do not suffice to maintain order then may call forth the militia of or more states for that object or employ for the same object any part of the land or naval force of the|united|state so also if the obstruction be to the law of the territory and be duly present to as a case of insurrection may employ for suppression the militia of any state or the land or naval force of the|united|state and if the territory be invade by the citizen of other states whether for the purpose of decide election or for any other and the local authority find unable to repel or withstand will be entitle to and upon the fact be fully ascertain shall most certainly receive the aid of the|general|government but be not the duty of the president of the|united|state to volunteer interposition by force to preserve the purity of election either in a state or territory to do so would be subversive of public freedom and whether a law be wise or unwise just or unjust be not a question for to judge if be constitutional that is if be the law of the land be duty to cause to be execute or to sustain the authority of any state or territory in execute in opposition to all insurrectionary movement system afford no justification of revolutionary act for the constitutional mean of relieve the people of unjust administration and law by a change of public agent and by repeal be ample and more prompt and effective than illegal violence these mean must be scrupulously guard this great prerogative of popular sovereignty sacredly respect be the undoubted right of the peaceable and orderly people of the|territory|of|kansas to elect own legislative body make own law and regulate own social institution without foreign or domestic molestation interference on the hand to procure the abolition or prohibition of slave labor in the territory have produce mischievous interference on the other for maintenance or introduction wrong beget another statement entirely unfounde or grossly exaggerated concern event within the territory be sedulously diffuse through remote states to feed the flame of sectional animosity there and the agitator there exert indefatigably in return to encourage and stimulate strife within the territory the inflammatory agitation of which the present be but a part have for twenty|year produce nothing save unmitigated evil north|and|south but for the character of the domestic institution of the future new state would have be a matter of too little interest to the inhabitant of the contiguous states personally or collectively to produce among any political emotion climate soil production hope of rapid advancement and the pursuit of happiness on the part of the settler with good wish but with no interference from without would have quietly determine the question which be at this time of such disturbing character but be constrain to turn attention to the circumstance of embarrassment as now exist be the duty of the people of kansas to discountenance every act or purpose of resistance to law above all the emergency appeal to the citizen of the states and especially of those contiguous to the territory neither by intervention of nonresident in election nor by unauthorized military force to attempt to encroach upon or usurp the authority of the inhabitant of the territory no citizen of country should permit to forget that be a part of government and entitle to be hear in the determination of policy and measure and that therefore the high consideration of personal honor and patriotism require to maintain by whatever of power or influence may possess the integrity of the law of the republic entertain these view will be imperative duty to exert the whole power of the|federal|executive to support public order in the territory to vindicate law whether federal or local against all attempt of organize resistance and so to protect people in the establishment of own institution undisturbe by encroachment from without and in the full enjoyment of the right of self government assure to by the constitution and the organic act of congress although serious and threatening disturbance in the|territory|of|kansas announce to by the governor in december last be speedily quiet without the effusion of blood and in a satisfactory manner there be regret to say reason to apprehend that disorder will continue to occur there with increase tendency to violence until some decisive measure be take to dispose of the question which constitute the inducement or occasion of internal agitation and of external interference this seem to can best be accomplish by provide that when the inhabitant of kansas may desire and shall be of sufficient number to constitute a state a convention of delegate duly elect by the qualified voter shall assemble to frame a constitution and thus to prepare through regular and lawful mean for admission into the union as a state respectfully recommend the enactment of a law to that effect recommend also that a special appropriation be make to defray any expense which may become requisite in the execution of the law or the maintenance of public order in the|territory|of|kansas transcript fellow citizens of the senate and of the|house|of|representatives the constitution of the|united|state provide that congress shall assemble annually on the|first|monday|of|december and have be usual for the president to make no communication of a public character to the senate and house|of|representatif until advise of readiness to receive have defer to this usage until the close of the|first|month of the session but conviction of duty will not permit longer to postpone the discharge of the obligation enjoin by the constitution upon the president to give to the congress information of the state of the union and recommend to consideration such measure as shall judge necessary and expedient be matter of congratulation that the republic be tranquilly advance in a career of prosperity and peace whilst relation of amity continue to exist between the|united|state and all foreign power with some of grave question be depend which may require the consideration of congress of such question the most important be that which have arise out of the negotiation with great|britain in reference to central|america by the convention conclude between the government on the|19th|of|april,|1850 both party covenant that neither will ever occupy or fortify or colonize or assume or exercise any dominion over nicaragua costa|rica the|mosquito|coast or any part of central|america be the undoubted understanding of the|united|state in make this treaty that all the present states of the former republic|of|central|america and the entire territory of each would thenceforth enjoy complete independence and that both contracting party engage equally and to the same extent for the present and for the future that if either then have any claim of right in such claim and all occupation or authority under be unreservedly relinquish by the stipulation of the convention and that no dominion be thereafter to be exercise or assume in any part of by great|britain or the|united|state this government consent to restriction in regard to a region of country wherein have specific and peculiar interest only upon the conviction that the like restriction be in the same sense obligatory on great|britain but for this understanding of the force and effect of the convention would never have be conclude by so clear be this understanding on the part of the|united|state that in correspondence contemporaneous with the ratification of the convention be distinctly express that the mutual covenant of nonoccupation be not intend to apply to the british establishment at the balize this qualification be to be ascribe to the fact that in virtue of successive treaty with previous sovereign of the country great|britain have obtain a concession of the right to cut mahogany or dyewood at the balize but with positive exclusion of all domain or sovereignty and thus confirm the natural construction and understand import of the treaty as to all the rest of the region to which the stipulation apply however become apparent at an|early|day after enter upon the discharge of present function that great|britain still continue in the exercise or assertion of large authority in all that part of central|america commonly call the|mosquito|coast and cover the entire length of the|state|of|nicaragua and a part of costa|rica that regard the balize as absolute domain and be gradually extend limit at the expense of the state of honduras and that have formally colonize a considerable insular group know as the|bay|islands and belong of right to that state all these act or pretension of great|britain be contrary to the right of and to the manifest tenor of stipulation with the|united|state as understand by this government have be make the subject of negotiation through the american minister in london transmit herewith the instruction to on the subject and the correspondence between and the british secretary for foreign affair by which will perceive that the government differ widely and irreconcilably as to the construction of the convention and effect on respective relation to central|america great|britain so construe the convention as to maintain unchanged all previous pretension over the|mosquito|coast and in different part of central|america these pretension as to the|mosquito|coast be found on the assumption of political relation between great|britain and the remnant of a tribe of indians on that coast enter into at a time when the whole country be a colonial possession of spain can not be successfully controvert that by the public law of europe and america no possible act of such indians or predecessor could confer on great|britain any political right great|britain do not allege the assent of spain as the origin of claim on the|mosquito|coast have on the contrary by repeat and successive treaty renounce and relinquish all pretension of own and recognize the full and sovereign right of spain in the most unequivocal term yet these pretension so without solid foundation in the beginning and thus repeatedly abjure be at a recent period revive by great|britain against the|central|american|state the legitimate successor to all the ancient jurisdiction of spain in that region be first apply only to a define part of the coast of nicaragua afterwards to the whole of atlantic coast and lastly to a part of the coast of costa|rica and be now reassert to this extent notwithstanding engagement to the|united|state on the eastern coast of nicaragua and costa|rica the interference of great|britain though exert at time in the form of military occupation of the port of san|juan|del|norte then in the peaceful possession of the appropriate authority of the|central|american states be now present by as the rightful exercise of a protectorship over the mosqttito tribe of indians but the establishment at the balize now reach far beyond treaty limit into the|state|of|honduras and that of the|bay|islands appertain of right to the same state be as distinctly colonial government as those of jamaica or canada and therefore contrary to the very letter as well as the spirit of the convention with the|united|state as be at the time of ratification and now be understand by this government the interpretation which the|british|government thus in assertion and act persist in ascribe to the convention entirely change character while hold to all obligation in a great measure release great|britain from those which constitute the consideration of this government for enter into the convention be impossible in judgment for the|united|state to acquiesce in such a construction of the respective relation of the government to central|america to a renew call by this government upon great|britain to abide by and carry into effect the stipulation of the convention accord to obvious import by withdraw from the possession or colonization of portion of the central american states of honduras nicaragua and costa|rica the|british|government have at length reply affirm that the operation of the treaty be prospective only and do not require great|britain to abandon or contract any possession hold by in central|america at the date of conclusion this reply substitute a partial issue in the place of the general present by the|united|state the|british|government pass over the question of the right of great|britain real or suppose in central|america and assume that have such right at the date of the treaty and that those right comprehend the protectorship of the|mosquito|indian the extended jurisdiction and limit of the balize and the colony of the|bay|islands and thereupon proceed by implication to infer that if the stipulation of the treaty be merely future in effect great|britain may still continue to hold the contest portion of central|america the|united|state can not admit either the inference or the premise steadily deny that at the date of the treaty great|britain have any possession there other than the limited and peculiar establishment at the balize and maintain that if have any be surrender by the convention this government recognize the obligation of the treaty have of course desire to see execute in good faith by both party and in the discussion therefore have not look to right which may assert independently of the treaty in consideration of geographical position and of other circumstance which create for relation to the central|american states different from those of any government of europe the|british|government in last communication although well know the view of the|united|state still declare that see no reason why a conciliatory spirit may not enable the government to overcome all obstacle to a satisfactory adjustment of the subject assure of the correctness of the construction of the treaty constantly adhere to by this government and resolve to insist on the right of the|united|state yet actuate also by the same desire which be avow by to remove all cause of serious misunderstanding between nation associate by so many tie of interest and kindre have appear to proper not to consider an amicable solution of the controversy hopeless there be however reason to apprehend that with great|britain in the actual occupation of the dispute territory and the treaty therefore practically null so far as regard right this international difficulty can not long remain undetermined without involve in serious danger the friendly relation which be the interest as well as the duty of both country to cherish and preserve will afford sincere gratification if future effort shall result in the success anticipate heretofore with more confidence than the aspect of the case permit now to entertain other subject of discussion between the|united|state and great|britain have grow out of the attempt which the exigency of the war in which be engage with russia induce to make to draw recruit from the|united|state be the traditional and settled policy of the|united|state to maintain impartial neutrality during the war which from time to time occur among the great power of the world perform all the duty of neutrality toward the respective belligerent state may reasonably expect not to interfere with lawful enjoyment of benefit notwithstanding the existence of such hostility citizen retain the individual right to continue all accustomed pursuit by land or by sea at home or abroad subject only to such restriction in this relation as the law of war the usage of nation or special treaty may impose and be sovereign right that territory and jurisdiction shall not be invade by either of the belligerent party for the transit of army the operation of fleet the levy of troop for service the fitting out of cruiser by or against either or any other act or incident of war and these undeniable right of neutrality individual and national will under no circumstance surrender in pursuance of this policy the law of the|united|state do not forbid citizen to sell to either of the belligerent power article contraband of war or take munition of war or soldier on board private ship for transportation and although in so do the individual citizen expose property or person to some of the hazard of war act do not involve any breach of national neutrality nor of implicate the government thus during the progress of the present war in europe citizen have without national responsibility therefor sell gunpowder and arm to all buyer regardless of the destination of those article merchantman have be and still continue to be largely employ by great|britain and by france in transport troop provision and munition of war to the principal seat of military operation and in bring home sick and wounded soldier but such use of mercantile marine be not interdict either by the international or by municipal law and therefore do not compromise neutral relation with russia but municipal law in accordance with the law of nation peremptorily forbid not only foreigner but own citizen to fit out within the|united|state a vessel to commit hostility against any state with which the|united|state be at peace or to increase the force of any foreign armed vessel intend for such hostility against a friendly state whatever concern may have be feel by either of the belligerent power lest private armed cruiser or other vessel in the service of one may be fit out in the port of this country to depredate on the property of the other all such fear have prove to be utterly groundless citizen have be withhold from any such act or purpose by good faith and by respect for the law while the law of the union be thus peremptory in prohibition of the equipment or armament of belligerent cruiser in port provide not less absolutely that no person shall within the territory or jurisdiction of the|united|state enlist or enter or hire or retain another person to enlist or enter or to go beyond the limit or jurisdiction of the|united|state with intent to be enlist or enter in the service of any foreign state either as a soldier or as a marine or seaman on board of any vessel of war letter of marque or privateer and these enactment be also in strict conformity with the law of nation which declare that no state have the right to raise troop for land or sea service in another state without consent and that whether forbid by the municipal law or not the very attempt to do without such consent be an attack on the national sovereignty such be the public right and the municipal law of the|united|state no solicitude on the subject be entertain by this government when a year since the|british|parliament pass an act to provide for the enlistment of foreigner in the military service of great|britain nothing on the face of the act or in public history indicate that the|british|government propose to attempt recruitment in the|united|state nor do ever give intimation of such intention to this government be matter of surprise therefore to find subsequently that the engagement of person within the|united|state to proceed to halifax in the|british|province|of|nova|scotia and there enlist in the service of great|britain be go on extensively with little or no disguise ordinary legal step be immediately take to arrest and punish party concern and so put an end to act infringe the municipal law and derogatory to sovereignty meanwhile suitable representation on the subject be address to the|british|government thereupon become known by the admission of the|british|government that the attempt to draw recruit from this country originate with or at least have approval and sanction but also appear that the public agent engage in bad stringent instruction not to violate the municipal law of the|united|state be difficult to understand how should have be suppose that troop could be raise here by great|britain without violation of the municipal law the unmistakable object of the law be to prevent every such act which if perform must be either in violation of the law or in study evasion of and in either alternative the act do would be alike injurious to the sovereignty of the|united|state in the meantime the matter acquire additional importance by the recruitment in the|united|state not be discontinue and the disclosure of the fact that be prosecute upon a systematic plan devise by official authority that recruit rendezvous have be open in principal city and depot for the reception of recruit establish on frontier and the whole business conduct under the supervision and by the regular cooperation of british officer civil and military some in the|north|american|province and some in the|united|state the complicity of those officer in an undertaking which could only be accomplish by defy law throw suspicion over attitude of neutrality and disregard territorial right be conclusively prove by the evidence elicit on the trial of such of agent as have be apprehend and convict some of the officer thus implicate be of high official position and many of beyond jurisdiction so that legal proceeding could not reach the source of the mischief these consideration and the fact that the cause of complaint be not a mere casual occurrence trot a deliberate design enter upon with full knowledge of law and national policy and conduct by responsible public functionary impel to present the case to in order to secure not only a cessation of the wrong but reparation the subject be still under discussion the result of which will be communicate to in due time repeat the recommendation submit to the last congress that provision be make for the appointment of a commissioner in connection with great|britain to survey and establish the boundary line which divide the|territory|of|washington from the contiguous british possession by reason of the extent and importance of the country in dispute there have be imminent danger of collision between the subject of great|britain and the citizen of the|united|state include respective authority in that|quarter the prospect of a speedy arrangement have contribute hitherto to induce on both side forbearance to assert by force what each claim as a right continuance of delay on the part of the government to act in the matter will increase the danger and difficulty of the controversy misunderstand exist as to the extent character and value of the possessory right of the|hudsons|bay|company and the property of the|pugets|sound|agricultural|company reserve in treaty with great|britain relative to oregon have reason to believe that a cession of the right of both company to the|united|state which would be the ready mean of terminate all question can be obtain on reasonable term and with a view to this end present the subject to the attention of congress the colony of newfoundland have enact the law require by the treaty of the 5th of june be now place on the same footing in respect to commercial intercourse with the|united|state as the other british north|american|province the commission which that treaty contemplate for determine the right of fishery in river and mouth of river on the coast of the|united|state and the|british|north|american|province have be organize and have commence labor to complete which there be need further appropriation for the service of another season in pursuance of the authority confer by a resolution of the senate of the|united|state pass on the of march last notice be give to denmark on the|14th|day|of|april of the intention of this government to avail of the stipulation of the subsist convention of friendship commerce and navigation between that kingdom and the|united|state whereby either party may after ten|year terminate the same at the expiration of one|year from the date of notice for that purpose the consideration which lead to call the attention of congress to that convention and induce the senate to adopt the resolution refer to still continue in full force the convention contain an article which although do not directly engage the|united|state to submit to the imposition of toll on the vessel and cargo of americans pass into or from the|baltic|sea during the continuance of the treaty yet may by possibility be construe as imply such submission the exaction of those toll not be justify by any principle of international law become the right and duty of the|united|state to relieve from the implication of engagement on the subject so as to be perfectly free to act in the premise in such way as public interest and honor shall demand remain of the opinion that the|united|states ought not to submit to the payment of the sound|due not so much because of amount which be a secondary matter but because be in effect the recognition of the right of denmark to treat of the great maritime highway of nation as a close sea and prevent the navigation of as a privilege for which tribute may be impose upon those who have occasion to use this government on a former occasion not unlike the present signalize determination to maintain the freedom of the sea and of the great natural channel of navigation the|barbary|state have for a long time coerce the payment of tribute from all nation whose ship frequent the mediterranean to the last demand of such payment make by the|united|state although suffer less by depredation than many other nation return the explicit answer that prefer war to tribute and thus open the way to the relief of the commerce of the world from an ignominious tax so long submit to by the more powerful nation of europe if the manner of payment of the sound due differ from that of the tribute formerly concede to the|barbary|states still exaction by denmark have no well foundation in right each be in origin nothing but a tax on a common natural right extort by those who be at that time able to obstruct the free and secure enjoyment of but who no longer possess that power denmark while resist assertion of the freedom of the|baltic|sound and belts have indicate a readiness to make some new arrangement on the subject and have invite the government interested include the|united|state to be represent in a convention to assemble for the purpose of receive and consider a proposition which intend to submit for the capitalization of the sound|due and the distribution of the sum to be pay as commutation among the government accord to the respective proportion of maritime commerce to and from the baltic have decline in behalf of the|united|state to accept this invitation for the most cogent reason be that denmark do not offer to submit to the convention the question of right to levy the sound due the second be that if the convention be allow to take cognizance of that particular question still would not be competent to deal with the great international principle involve which affect the right in other case of navigation and commercial freedom as well as that of access to the baltic above all by the express term of the proposition be contemplate that the consideration of the sound due shall be commingle with and make subordinate to a matter wholly extraneous the balance of power among the|governments|of|europe while however reject this proposition and insist on the right of free transit into and from the baltic have express to denmark a willingness on the part of the|united|state to share liberally with other power in compensate for any advantage which commerce shall hereafter derive from expenditure make by for the improvement and safety of the navigation of the sound|or belts lay before herewith sundry document on the subject in which view be more fully disclose should no satisfactory arrangement be soon conclude shall again call attention to the subject with recommendation of such measure as may appear to be require in order to assert and secure the right of the|united|state so far as be affect by the pretension of denmark announce with much gratification that since the adjournment of the last congress the question then exist between this government and that of france respect the french consul at san|francisco have be satisfactorily determine and that the relation of the government continue to be of the most friendly nature a question also which have be pende for several|year between the|united|state and grow out of the sequestration by public authority of that country of property belong to the present american consul at athens and which have be the subject of very earnest discussion heretofore have recently be settle to the satisfaction of the party interested and of both government with spain peaceful relation be still maintain and some progress have be make in secure the redress of wrong complain of by this government spain have not only disavow and disapprove the conduct of the officer who illegally seize and detain the steamer black|warrior at havana but have also pay the sum claim as indemnity for the loss thereby inflict on citizen of the|united|state in consequence of a destructive hurricane which visit cuba in the supreme authority of that island issue a decree permit the importation for the|period|of|six|month of certain building material and provision free of duty but revoke when about|half the period only have elapse to the injury of citizen of the|united|state who have proceed to act on the faith of that decree the|spanish|government refuse indemnification to the party aggrieve until recently when be assent to payment be promise to be make so soon as the amount due can be ascertain satisfaction claim for the arrest and search of the steamer el|dorado have not yet be accord but there be reason to believe that will be and that case with other continue to be urge on the attention of the|spanish|government do not abandon the hope of conclude with spain some general arrangement which if do not wholly prevent the recurrence of difficulty in cuba will render less frequent and whenever shall occur facilitate more speedy settlement the interposition of this government have be invoke by many of citizen on account of injury do to person and property for which the|mexican|republic be responsible the unhappy situation of that country for some time past have not allow government to give due consideration to claim of private reparation and have appear to call for and justify some forbearance in such matter on the part of this government but if the revolutionary movement which have lately occur in that republic end in the organization of a stable government urgent appeal to justice will then be make and may be hope with success for the redress of all complaint of citizen in regard to the american republics which from proximity and other consideration have peculiar relation to this government while have be constant aim strictly to observe all the obligation of political friendship and of good neighborhood obstacle to this have arise in some of from own insufficient power to cheek lawless irruption which in effect throw most of the task on the|united|state thus be that the distracted internal condition of the|state|of|nicaragua have make incumbent on to appeal to the good faith of citizen to abstain from unlawful intervention in affair and to adopt preventive measure to the same end which on a similar occasion have the good result in reassure the peace of of sonora and lower|california since the last session of congress a treaty of amity commerce and navigation and for the surrender of fugitive criminal with a treaty of friendship commerce and navigation with nicaragua and a convention of commercial reciprocity with the hawaiian kingdom have be negotiate the latter kingdom and the|state|of|nicaragua have also accede to a declaration recognize as international right the principle contain in the convention between the|united|state and russia of july|22,|1854 these treaty and convention will be lay before the senate for ratification the statement make in last annual message respect the anticipate receipt and expenditure of the treasury have be substantially verify appear from the report of the secretary of the treasury that the receipt during the|last|fiscal|year end june|30,|1855 from all source be and that the public expenditure for the same period exclusive of payment on account of the public debt amount to during the same period the payment make in redemption of the public debt include interest and premium amount to the balance in the treasury at the beginning of the|present|fiscal|year july|1,|1855 be the receipt for the|first|quarter and the estimate receipt for the remain three|quarters amount together to thus afford in all as the available resource of the|current|fiscal|year the sum of if to the actual expenditure of the|first|quarter of be add the probable expenditure for the remain three|quarters as estimate by the secretary of the treasury the sum total will be thereby leave an estimate balance in the treasury on july|1,|1856 of in the above estimate expenditure of the|present|fiscal|year be include to meet the last installment of the ten|million provide for in the late treaty with mexico and appropriate on account of the debt due to texas which sum make an aggregate amount of and reduce the expenditure actual or estimate for ordinary object of the|year to the sum of the amount of the public debt at the commencement of the|present|fiscal|year be and deduction be make of subsequent payment the whole public debt of the|federal|government remain at this time be less|than|$40,000,000 the remnant of certain other government stock amount to refer to in last message as outstanding have since be pay be fully persuade that would be difficult to devise a system superior to that by which the fiscal business of the government be now conduct notwithstanding the great number of public agent of collection and disbursement be believe that the check and guard provide include the requirement of monthly return render scarcely possible for any considerable fraud on the part of those agent or neglect involve hazard of serious public loss to escape detection renew however the recommendation heretofore make by of the enactment of a law declare felony on the part of public officer to insert false entry in book of record or account or to make false return and also require on the termination of service to deliver to successor all book record and other object of a public nature in custody derive as public revenue be in chief part from duty on import magnitude afford gratify evidence of the prosperity not only of commerce but of the other great interest upon which that depend the principle that all money not require for the current expense of the government should remain for active employment in the hand of the people and the conspicuous fact that the annual revenue from all source exceed by many millions|of|dollar the amount need for a prudent and economical administration of public affair can not fail to suggest the propriety of an early revision and reduction of the tariff of duty on import be now so generally concede that the purpose of revenue alone can justify the imposition of duty on import that in readjust the impost table and schedule which unquestionably require essential modification a departure from the principle of the present tariff be not anticipate the army during the|past|year have be actively engage in defend the indian frontier the state of the service permitting but few and small garrison in permanent fortification the additional regiment authorize at the last session of congress have be recruit and organize and a large portion of the troop have already be send to the field all the duty which devolve on the military establishment have be satisfactorily perform and the danger and privation incident to the character of the service require of troop have furnish additional evidence of courage zeal and capacity to meet any requisition which country may make upon for the detail of the military operation the distribution of the troop and additional provision require for the military service refer to the report of the secretary of war and the accompany document experience gather from event which have transpire since last annual message have but serve to confirm the opinion then express of the propriety of make provision by a retired list for disabled officer and for increase compensation to the officer retain on the list for active duty all the reason which exist when these measure be recommend on former occasion continue without modification except so far as circumstance have give to some of additional force the recommendation heretofore make for a partial reorganization of the army be also renew the thorough elementary education give to those officer who commence service with the grade of cadet qualify to a considerable extent to perform the duty of every arm of the service but to give the high efficiency to artillery require the practice and special study of many|years and be not therefore believe to be advisable to maintain in time of peace a large force of that arm than can be usually employ in the duty appertain to the service of field and siege artillery the duty of the staff in all various branch belong to the movement of troop and the efficiency of an army in the field would materially depend upon the ability with which those duty be discharge be not as in the case of the artillery a specialty but require also an intimate knowledge of the duty of an officer of the line and be not doubt that to complete the education of an officer for either the line or the general staff be desirable that shall have serve in both with this view be recommend on a former occasion that the duty of the staff should be mainly perform by detail from the line and with conviction of the advantage which would result from such a change be again present for the consideration of congress the report of the secretary of the navy herewith submit exhibit in full the naval operation of the|past|year together with the present condition of the service and make suggestion of further legislation to which attention be invite the construction of the steam frigate for which appropriation be make by the last congress have proceed in the most satisfactory manner and with such expedition as to warrant the belief that will be ready for service early in the|coming|spring important as this addition to naval force be still remain inadequate to the contingent exigency of the protection of the extensive seacoast and vast commercial interest of the|united|state in view of this fact and of the acknowledge wisdom of the policy of a gradual and systematic increase of the navy an appropriation be recommend for the construction of steam sloop of war in regard to the step take in execution of the act of congress to promote the efficiency of the navy be unnecessary for to say more than to express entire concurrence in the observation on that subject present by the secretary in report will be perceive by the report of the postmaster general that the gross expenditure of the department for be and the gross receipt make an excess of expenditure over receipt of and that the cost of mail transportation during that|year be great than the|previous|year much of the heavy expenditure to which the treasury be thus subject be to be ascribe to the large quantity of print matter convey by the mail either frank or liable to no postage by law or to very low rate of postage compare with that charge on letter and to the great cost of mail service on railroad and by ocean steamer the suggestion of the|postmaster general on the subject deserve the consideration of congress the report of the secretary of the interior will engage attention as well for useful suggestion contain as for the interest and importance of the subject to which refer the aggregate amount of public land sell during the|last|fiscal|year locate with military scrip or land warrant take up under grant for road and select as swamp land by states be of which the portion sell be yield in receipt the sum of in the same period of time 8,723,854|acre have be survey but in consideration of the quantity already subject to entry no additional tract have be bring into market the peculiar relation of the|general|government to the|district|of|columbia render proper to commend to care not only material but also moral interest include education more especially in those part of the district outside of the city of washington and georgetown the commissioner appoint to revise and codify the law of the district have make such progress in the performance of task as to insure completion in the time prescribe by the act of congress information have recently be receive that the peace of the settlement in the|territories|of|oregon and washington be disturb by hostility on the part of the indians with indication of extensive combination of a hostile character among the tribe in that|quarter the more serious in possible effect by reason of the undetermined foreign interest exist in those territories to which attention have already be especially invite efficient measure have be take which be believe will restore quiet and afford protection to citizen in the|territory|of|kansas there have be act prejudicial to good order but as yet none have occur under circumstance to justify the interposition of that could only be in case of obstruction to federal law or of organize resistance to territorial law assume the character of insurrection which if should occur would be duty promptly to overcome and suppress cherish the hope however that the occurrence of any such untoward event will be prevent by the sound sense of the people of the territory who by organic law possess the right to determine own domestic institution be entitle while deport peacefully to the free exercise of that right and must be protect in the enjoyment of without interference on the part of the citizen of any of the states the southern boundary line of this territory have never be survey and establish the rapidly extend settlement in that region and the fact that the main route between independence in the|state of missouri and new|mexico be contiguous in this line suggest the probability that embarrassing question of jurisdiction may consequently arise for these and other consideration commend the subject to early attention have thus pass in review the general state of the union include such particular concern of the|federal|government whether of domestic or foreign relation as appear to desirable and useful to bring to the special notice of congress unlike the great states of europe and asia and many of those of america these|united|states be waste strength neither in foreign war nor domestic strife whatever of discontent or public dissatisfaction exist be attributable to the imperfection of human nature or be incident to all government however perfect which human wisdom can devise such subject of political agitation as occupy the public mind consist to a great extent of exaggeration of inevitable evil or over zeal in social improvement or mere imagination of grievance have but remote connection with any of the constitutional function or duty of the|federal|government to whatever extent these question exhibit a tendency menace to the stability of the constitution or the integrity of the union and no further demand the consideration of the executive and require to be present by to congress before the colony become a confederation of independent states be associate only by community of transatlantic origin by geographical position and by the mutual tie of common dependence on great|britain when that tie be sunder severally assume the power and right of absolute self government the municipal and social institution of each law of property and of personal relation even political organization be such only as each one choose to establish wholly without interference from any other in the language of the|declaration|of|independence each state have full power to levy war conclude peace contract alliance establish commerce and to do all other act and thing which independent state may of right do the several colony differ in climate in soil in natural production in religion in system of education in legislation and in the form of political administration and continue to differ in these respect when voluntarily ally as states to carry on the|war|of|the|revolution the object of that war be to disenthrall the united colony from foreign rule which have prove to be oppressive and to separate permanently from the mother country the political result be the foundation of a federal republic of the free white man of the colony constitute as be in distinct and reciprocally independent state government as for the subject race whether indian or african the wise and brave statesman of that|day be engage in no extravagant scheme of social change leave as be and thus preserve and posterity from the anarchy and the ever recur civil war which have prevail in other revolutionize european colony of america when the confederate states find convenient to modify the condition of association by give to direct access in some respect to the people of the states instead of confine to action on the states as such proceed to frame the exist constitution adhere steadily to guide thought which be to delegate only such power as be necessary and proper to the execution of specific purpose or in other word to retain as much as possible consistently with those purpose of the independent power of the individual states for object of common defense and security intrust to the|general|government certain carefully define function leave all other as the undelegated right of the separate independent sovereignty such be the constitutional theory of government the practical observance of which have carry and alone among modern republic through nearly|three generation of time without the cost of drop of blood shed in civil war with freedom and concert of action have enable to contend successfully on the battlefield against foreign foe have elevate the feeble colony into powerful states and have raise industrial production and commerce which transport to the level of the rich and the great nation of europe and the admirable adaptation of political institution to object combine local self government with aggregate strength have establish the practicability of a government like our to cover a continent with confederate state the|congress|of|the|united|states be in effect that congress of sovereignty which good man in the old world have seek for but could never attain and which impart to america an exemption from the mutable league for common action from the war the mutual invasion and vague aspiration after the balance of power which convulse from time to time the|governments|of|europe cooperative action rest in the condition of permanent confederation prescribe by the constitution balance of power be in the separate reserved right of the states and equal representation in the senate that independent sovereignty in every of the states with reserved right of local self government assure to each by coequal power in the senate be the fundamental condition of the constitution without the union would never have exist however desirous the large state may be to reorganize the government so as to give to population proportionate weight in the common counsel know be impossible unless concede to the small one authority to exercise at least a negative influence on all the measure of the government whether legislative or executive through equal representation in the senate indeed the large state could not have fail to perceive that the same power be equally necessary to for the security of own domestic interest against the aggregate force of the|general|government in a word the original states go into this permanent league on the agree premise of exert common strength for the defense of the whole and of all part but of utterly exclude all capability of reciprocal aggression each solemnly bind to all the other neither to undertake nor permit any encroachment upon or intermeddle with another 's reserve right where be deem expedient particular right of the states be expressly guarantee by the constitution but in all thing besides these right be guard by the limitation of the power grant and by express reservation of all power not grant in the compact of union thus the great power of taxation be limit to purpose of common defense and general welfare exclude object appertain to the local legislation of the several states and those purpose of general welfare and common defense be afterwards define by specific enumeration as be matter only of co - relation between the states or between and foreign government which because of common and general nature could not be leave to the separate control of each state of the circumstance of local condition interest and right in which a portion of the states constitute great section of the union differ from the rest and from another section the most important be the peculiarity of a large relative colored population in the southern than in the|northern|state a population of this class hold in subjection exist in nearly all the states but be more numerous and of more serious concernment in the south than in the north on account of natural difference of climate and production and be foresee that for the same reason while this population would diminish and sooner or later cease to exist in some states may increase in other the peculiar character and magnitude of this question of local right not in material relation only but still more in social one cause to enter into the special stipulation of the constitution hence while the|general|government as well by the enumerate power grant to as by those not enumerate and therefore refuse to be forbid to touch this matter in the sense of attack or offense be place under the general safeguard of the union in the sense of defense against either invasion or domestic violence like all other local interest of the several states each state expressly stipulate as well for as for each and all of citizen and every citizen of each state become solemnly bind by allegiance to the constitution that any person hold to service or labor in state escape into another should not in consequence of any law or regulation thereof be discharge from such service or labor but should be deliver up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due by the law of state thus and thus only by the reciprocal guaranty of all the right of every state against interference on the part of another be the present form of government establish by father and transmit to and by no other mean be possible for to exist if state cease to respect the right of another and obtrusively intermeddle with local interest if a portion of the states assume to impose institution on the other or refuse to fulfill obligation to be no longer united friendly states but distracted hostile one with little capacity leave of common advantage but abundant mean of reciprocal injury and mischief practically be immaterial whether aggressive interference between the states or deliberate refusal on the part of any of to comply with constitutional obligation arise from erroneous conviction or blind prejudice whether be perpetrate by direction or indirection in either case be full of threat and of danger to the durability of the union place in the office of chief magistrate as the executive agent of the whole country bind to take care that the law be faithfully execute and specially enjoin by the constitution to give information to congress on the state of the union would be palpable neglect of duty on part to pass over a subject like this which beyond all thing at the present time vitally concern individual and public security have be matter of painful regret to see states conspicuous for service in round this republic and equally share advantage disregard constitutional obligation to although conscious of inability to heal admit and palpable social evil of own and which be completely within jurisdiction engage in the offensive and hopeless undertaking of reform the domestic institution of other states wholly beyond control and authority in the vain pursuit of end by entirely unattainable and which may not legally attempt to compass peril the very existence of the constitution and all the countless benefit which have confer while the people of the southern|states confine attention to own affair not presume officiously to intermeddle with the social institution of the|northern|state too many of the inhabitant of the latter be permanently organize in association to inflict injury on the former by wrongful act which would be cause of war as between foreign power and only fail to be such in system because perpetrate under cover of the union be possible to present this subject as truth and the occasion require without notice the reiterated but groundless allegation that the south have persistently assert claim and obtain advantage in the practical administration of the|general|government to the prejudice of the north and in which the latter have acquiesce that is the states which either promote or tolerate attack on the right of person and of property in other states to disguise own injustice pretend or imagine and constantly aver that whose constitutional right be thus systematically assail be the aggressor at the present time this imputed aggression rest as do only in the vague declamatory charge of political agitator resolve into misapprehension or misinterpretation of the principle and fact of the political organization of the new territories of the|united|state what be the voice of history when the ordinance which provide for the government of the territory northwest of the river ohio and for eventual subdivision into new states be adopt in be not to be suppose that the question of future relative power as between the states which retain and those which do not retain a numerous colored population escape notice or fail to be consider and yet the concession of that vast territory to the interest and opinion of the|northern|states a territory now the seat of among the large member of the union be in great measure the act of the|state|of|virginia and of the south when louisiana be acquire by the|united|state be an acquisition not less to the north than to the south for while be important to the country at the mouth of the river mississippi to become the emporium of the country above so also be even more important to the whole union to have that emporium and although the new province by reason of imperfect settlement be mainly regard as on the|gulf|of|mexico yet in fact extend to the opposite boundary of the|united|state with far great breadth above than below and be in territory as in everything else equally at least an accession to the|northern|states be mere delusion and prejudice therefore to speak of louisiana as acquisition in the special interest of the south the patriotic and just man who participate in the act be influence by motif far above all sectional jealousy be in truth the great event which by complete for the possession of the valley of the mississippi with commercial access to the|gulf|of|mexico impart unity and strength to the whole confederation and attach together by indissoluble tie the east and the west as well as the north and the south as to florida that be but the transfer by spain to the|united|state of territory on the east side of the river mississippi in exchange for large territory which the|united|state transfer to spain on the west side of that river as the entire diplomatic history of the transaction serve to demonstrate moreover be an acquisition demand by the commercial interest and the security of the whole union in the meantime the people of the|united|state have grow up to a proper consciousness of strength and in a brief contest with france and in a second serious war with great|britain have shake off all which remain of undue reverence for europe and emerge from the atmosphere of those transatlantic influence which surround the infant republic and have begin to turn attention to the full and systematic development of the internal resource of the union among the evanescent controversy of that period the most conspicuous be the question of regulation by congress of the social condition of the future states to be round in the territory of louisiana the ordinance for the government of the territory northwest of the river ohio have contain a provision which prohibit the use of servile labor therein subject to the condition of the extradition of fugitive from service due in any other part of the|united|state subsequently to the adoption of the constitution this provision cease to remain as a law for operation as such be absolutely supersede by the constitution but the recollection of the fact excite the zeal of social propagandism in some section of the confederation and when a second state that of missouri come to be form in the territory of louisiana proposition be make to extend to the latter territory the restriction originally apply to the country situate between the river ohio and mississippi most questionable as be this proposition in all constitutional relation nevertheless receive the sanction of congress with some slight modification of line to save the exist right of the intend new state be reluctantly acquiesce in by southern|states as a sacrifice to the cause of peace and of the union not only of the right stipulate by the treaty of louisiana but of the principle of equality among the states guarantee by the constitution be receive by the|northern|state with angry and resentful condemnation and complaint because do not concede all which have exactingly demand have pass through the form of legislation take place in the statute book stand open to repeal like any other act of doubtful constitutionality subject to be pronounce null and void by the court of law and possess no possible efficacy to control the right of the states which may thereafter be organize out of any part of the original territory of louisiana in all this if any aggression there be any innovation upon preexist right to which portion of the union be justly chargeable this controversy pass away with the occasion nothing survive save the dormant letter of the statute but long afterwards when by the propose accession of the|republic|of|texas the|united|state be to take next step in territorial greatness a similar contingency occur and become the occasion for systematized attempt to intervene in the domestic affair of section of the union in defiance of right as states and of the stipulation of the constitution these attempt assume a practical direction in the shape of persevere endeavor by some of the representatives in both houses of congress to deprive the|southern|state of the suppose benefit of the provision of the act authorize the organization of the|state of missouri but the good sense of the people and the vital force of the constitution triumph over sectional prejudice and the political error of the|day and the state of texas return to the union as be with social institution which people have choose for and with express agreement by the reannexe act that should be susceptible of subdivision into a plurality of states whatever advantage the interest of the|southern|state as such gain by this be far inferior in result as unfold in the progress of time to those which spring from previous concession make by the south to every thoughtful friend of the union to the true lover of country to all who long and labor for the full success of this great experiment of republican institution be cause of gratulation that such an opportunity have occur to illustrate advance power on this continent and to furnish to the world additional assurance of the strength and stability of the constitution who would wish to see florida still a european colony who would rejoice to hail texas as a lone star instead of in the galaxy of states who do not appreciate the incalculable benefit of the acquisition of louisiana and yet narrow view and sectional purpose would inevitably have exclude all from the union but another struggle on the same point ensue when victorious army return from mexico and devolve on congress to provide for the territory acquire by the treaty of guadalupe|hidalgo the great relation of the subject have now become distinct and clear to the perception of the public mind which appreciate the evil of sectional controversy upon the question of the admission of new states in that crisis intense solicitude pervade the nation but the patriotic impulse of the popular heart guide by the admonitory advice of the father of country rise superior to all the difficulty of the incorporation of a new empire into the union in the counsel of congress there be manifest extreme antagonism of opinion and action between some representatives who seek by the abusive and unconstitutional employment of the legislative power of the government to interfere in the condition of the inchoate states and to impose own social theory upon the latter and other representatives who repel the interposition of the|general|government in this respect and maintain the self constitute right of the states in truth the thing attempt be in form alone action of the|general|government while in reality be the endeavor by abuse of legislative power to force the idea of internal policy entertain in particular states upon ally independent states once more the constitution and the union triumph signally the new territory be organize without restriction on the dispute point and be thus leave to judge in that particular for and the sense of constitutional faith prove vigorous enough in congress not only to accomplish this primary object but also the incidental and hardly less important of so amend the provision of the statute for the extradition of fugitive from service as to place that public duty under the safeguard of the|general|government and thus relieve from obstacle raise up by the legislation of some of the|state vain declamation regard the provision of law for the extradition of fugitive from service with occasional episode of frantic effort to obstruct execution by riot and murder continue for a brief time to agitate certain locality but the true principle of leave each state and territory to regulate own law of labor accord to own sense of right and expediency have acquire fast hold of the public judgment to such a degree that by common consent be observe in the organization of when more recently become requisite to organize the|territories|of|nebraska and kansas be the natural and legitimate if not the inevitable consequence of previous event and legislation that the same great and sound principle which have already be apply to utah and new|mexico should be apply to that should stand exempt from the restriction propose in the act relative to the|state of missouri these restriction be in the estimation of many thoughtful man null from the beginning unauthorized by the constitution contrary to the treaty stipulation for the cession of louisiana and inconsistent with the equality of these states have be strip of all moral authority by persistent effort to procure indirect repeal through contradictory enactment have be practically abrogate by the legislation attend the organization of utah new|mexico and washington if any vitality remain in would have be take away in effect by the new territorial act in the form originally propose to the senate at the first session of the last congress be manly and ingenuous as well as patriotic and just to do this directly and plainly and thus relieve the statute book of an act which may be of possible future injury but of no possible future benefit and the measure of repeal be the final consummation and complete recognition of the principle that no portion of the|united|state shall undertake through assumption of the power of the|general|government to dictate the social institution of any other portion the scope and effect of the language of repeal be not leave in doubt be declare in term to be the true intent and meaning of this act not to legislate slavery into any territory or state nor to exclude therefrom but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate domestic institution in own way subject only to the|united|state the measure could not be withstand upon merit alone be attack with violence on the false or delusive pretext that constitute a breach of faith never be objection more utterly destitute of substantial justification when before be imagine by sensible man that a regulative or declarative statute whether enact ten|or|forty|years|ago be irrepealable that an act of congress be above the constitution if indeed there be in the fact any cause to impute bad faith would attach to those only who have never cease from the time of the enactment of the restrictive provision to the|present|day to denounce and condemn who have constantly refuse to complete by needful supplementary legislation who have spare no exertion to deprive of moral force who have again and again attempt repeal by the enactment of incompatible provision and who by the inevitable reactionary effect of own violence on the subject awaken the country to perception of the true constitutional principle of leave the matter involve to the discretion of the people of the respective exist or incipient states be not pretend that this principle or any other preclude the possibility of evil in practice disturb as political action be liable to be by human passion no form of government be exempt from inconvenience but in this case be the result of the abuse and not of the legitimate exercise of the power reserve or confer in the organization of a territory be not to be charge to the great principle of popular sovereignty on the contrary disappear before the intelligence and patriotism of the people exert through the ballot box peaceful and silent but irresistible power if the friend of the constitution be to have another struggle enemy could not present a more acceptable issue than that of a state whose constitution clearly embrace a republican form of government be exclude from the union because domestic institution may not in all respect comport with the idea of what be wise and expedient entertain in some other state fresh from groundless imputation of breach of faith against other man will commence the agitation of this new question with indubitable violation of an express compact between the independent sovereign power of the|united|state and of the|republic|of|texas as well as of the old and equally solemn compact which assure the equality of all the states but deplorable as would be such a violation of compact in and in all direct consequence that be the very least of the evil involve when sectional agitator shall have succeed in force on this issue can pretension fail to be meet by counter pretension will not different state be compel respectively to meet extreme with extreme and if either extreme carry point what be that so far forth but dissolution of the union if a new state form from the territory of the|united|state be absolutely exclude from admission therein that fact of constitute the disruption of union between and the other states but the process of dissolution could not stop there would not a sectional decision produce such result by a majority of vote either northern|or|southern of necessity drive out the oppressed and aggrieve minority and place in presence of each other irreconcilably hostile confederation be necessary to speak thus plainly of project the offspring of that sectional agitation now prevail in some of the states which be as impracticable as be unconstitutional and which if persevere in must and will end calamitously be either disunion and civil war or be mere angry idle aimless disturbance of public peace and tranquillity disunion for what if the passionate rage of fanaticism and partisan spirit do not force the fact upon attention would be difficult to believe that any considerable portion of the people of this enlighten country could have so surrender to a fanatical devotion to the suppose interest of the relatively few africans in the|united|state as totally to abandon and disregard the interest of the americans to trample under foot the injunction of moral and constitutional obligation and to engage in plan of vindictive hostility against those who be associate with in the enjoyment of the common heritage of national institution nor be hostility against fellow citizen of section of the union alone the interest the honor the duty the peace and the prosperity of the people of all section be equally involve and imperil in this question and be patriotic man in any part of the union prepare on such issue thus madly to invite all the consequence of the forfeiture of constitutional engagement be impossible the storm of frenzy and faction must inevitably dash in vain against the unshaken rock of the constitution shall never doubt know that the union be strong a|thousand time than all the wild and chimerical scheme of social change which be generate after another in the unstable mind of visionary sophist and interested agitator rely confidently on the patriotism of the people on the dignity and self respect of the states on the wisdom of congress and above all on the continue gracious favor of almighty god to maintain against all enemy whether at home or abroad the sanctity of the constitution and the integrity of the union transcript to the senate and house|of|representatif in return to the|house|of|representatives in which originate a bill entitle an act make appropriation for the repair preservation and completion of certain public work heretofore commence under the authority of law become necessary for owe to the late day at which the bill be pass to state objection to very briefly announce at the same time a purpose to resume the subject for more deliberate discussion at the present session of congress for while by no mean insensible of the arduousness of the task thus undertake by conceive that the houses be entitle to an exposition of the consideration which have induce dissent on part from conclusion in this instance the great constitutional question of the power of the|general|government in relation to internal improvement have be the subject of earnest difference of opinion at every period of the history of the|united|state annual and special message of successive president have be occupy with sometimes in remark on the general topic and frequently in objection to particular bill the conflicting sentiment of eminent statesman express in congress or in convention call expressly to devise if possible some plan calculate to relieve the subject of the embarrassment with which be environ while have direct public attention strongly to the magnitude of the interest involve have yet leave unsettled the limit not merely of expediency but of constitutional power in relation to work of this class by the|general|government what be intend by the phrase internal improvement what do embrace and what exclude no such language be find in the constitution not only be not an expression of ascertainable constitutional power but have no sufficient exactness of meaning to be of any value as the basis of a safe conclusion either of constitutional law or of practical statesmanship president john|quincy|adams in claim on occasion after retirement from office the authorship of the idea of introduce into the administration of the affair of the|general|government a permanent and regular system of internal improvement speak of as a system by which the whole union would have be checker over with railroad and canal afford high wage and constant employment to hundreds|of|thousand of laborer and place in express contrast with the construction of such work by the legislation of the states and by private enterprise be quite obvious that if there be any constitutional power which authorize the construction of railroad and canal by congress the same power must comprehend turnpike and ordinary carriage road nay must extend to the construction of bridge to the draining of marsh to the erection of levee to the construction of canal of irrigation in a word to all the possible mean of the material improvement of the earth by develop natural resource anywhere and everywhere even within the proper jurisdiction of the several states but if there be any constitutional power thus comprehensive in nature must not the same power embrace within scope other kind of improvement of equal utility in and equally important to the welfare of the whole country president jefferson while intimate the expediency of so amend the constitution as to comprise object of physical progress and well being do not fail to perceive that other object of public improvement include public education by name belong to the same class of power in fact not only public instruction but hospital establishment of science and art library and indeed everything appertain to the internal welfare of the country be just as much object of internal improvement or in other word of internal utility as canal and railway the admission of the power in either of sens imply existence in the other and since if exist at all involve dangerous augmentation of the political function and of the patronage of the|federal|government ought to see clearly by what clause or clause of the constitution be confer have have occasion more than once to express and deem proper now to repeat that be in judgment to be take for grant as a fundamental proposition not require elucidation that the|federal|government be the creature of the individual states and of the people of the states severally that the sovereign power be in alone that all the power of the|federal|government be derivative one the enumeration and limitation of which be contain in the instrument which organize and by express term the power not delegate to the|united|state by the constitution nor prohibit by to the states be reserve to the states respectively or to the people start from this foundation of constitutional faith and proceed to inquire in what part of the constitution the power of make appropriation for internal improvement be find be necessary to reject all idea of there be any grant of power in the preamble when that instrument say the people of the|united|state in order to form a more perfect union establish justice insure domestic tranquillity provide for the common defense promote the general welfare and secure the blessing of liberty to and posterity only declare the inducement and the anticipate result of the thing ordain and establish by to assume that anything more can be design by the language of the preamble would be to convert all the body of the constitution with carefully weighed enumeration and limitation into mere surplusage the same may be say of the phrase in the grant of the power to congress to pay the debt and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the|united|state or to construe the word more exactly be not significant of grant or concession but of restriction of the specific grant have the effect of say that in lay and collect taxis for each of the precise object of power grant to the|general|government|congress must exercise any such definite and undoubted power in strict subordination to the purpose of the common defense and general welfare of all the states there be no specific grant in the constitution of a power to sanction appropriation for internal improvement and no general provision broad enough to cover any such indefinite object become necessary to look for particular power to which or another of the thing include in the phrase internal improvement may be refer in the discussion of this question by the advocate of the organization of a general system of internal improvement under the auspex of the|federal|government reliance be have for the justification of the measure on several of the power expressly grant to congress such as to establish post - office and post - road to declare war to provide and maintain a navy to raise and support army to regulate commerce and to dispose of the territory and other public property of the|united|state as to the last of these source of power that of dispose of the territory and other public property of the|united|state may be concede that authorize congress in the management of the public property to make improvement essential to the successful execution of the trust but this must be the primary object of any such improvement and would be an abuse of the trust to sacrifice the interest of the property to incidental purpose as to the other assume source of a general power over internal improvement be specific power of which this be suppose to be the incident if the framer of the constitution wise and thoughtful man as be intend to confer on congress the power over a subject so wide as the whole field of internal improvement be remarkable that do not use language clearly to express or in other word that do not give as a distinct and substantive power instead of make the imply incident of some other for such be the magnitude of the suppose incidental power and capacity of expansion that any system establish under would exceed each of the other in the amount of expenditure and number of the person employ which would thus be throw upon the|general|government this position may be illustrate by take as a single example of the many thing comprehend clearly in the idea of a general system of internal improvement namely road let be suppose that the power to construct road over the whole union accord to the suggestion of president j.|q.|adams in whilst a member of the senate of the|united|state have be concede congress would have begin in pursuance of the state of knowledge at the time by construct turnpike then as knowledge advance would have construct canal and at the present time would have be embark in an almost limitless scheme of railroad now there be in the|united|state the result of state or private enterprise upward of of railroad and of canal in all 22,000|miles the total cost of which may be estimate at little short of and if the same work have be construct by the|federal|government suppose the thing to have be practicable the cost would have probably be not the number of person employ in superintending manage and keep up these canal and railroad may be state at or thereabout to which be to be add or employ on the railroad in construction make a total of person represent in family nearly|1,000,000 soul employ on or maintain by this class of public work in the|united|state in view of all this be not easy to estimate the disastrous consequence which must have result from such extend local improvement be undertake by the|general|government state legislation upon this subject would have be suspend and private enterprise paralyze while application for appropriation would have pervert the legislation of congress exhausted the|national|treasury and leave the people burden with a heavy public debt beyond the capacity of generation to discharge be conceivable that the framer of the constitution intend that authority draw after such immense consequence should be infer by implication as the incident of enumerate power can not think this and the impossibility of suppose would be still more glaring if similar calculation be carry out in regard to the numerous object of material moral and political usefulness of which the idea of internal improvement admit may be safely infer that if the framer of the constitution have intend to confer the power to make appropriation for the object indicate would have be enumerate among the grant expressly make to congress when therefore any of the power actually enumerate be adduce or refer to as the ground of an assumption to warrant the incidental or imply power of internal improvement that hypothesis must be reject or at least can be no further admit than as the particular act of internal improvement may happen to be necessary to the exercise of the grant power thus when the object of a give road the clearing of a particular channel or the construction of a particular harbor of refuge be manifestly require by the exigency of the naval or military service of the country then seem to undeniable that may be constitutionally comprehend in the power to declare war to provide and maintain a navy and to raise and support army at the same time would be a misuse of these power and a violation of the constitution to undertake to build upon a great system of internal improvement and similar reasoning apply to the assumption of any such power as be involve in that to establish post - road and to regulate commerce if the particular improvement whether by land or sea be necessary to the execution of the enumerate power then but not otherwise fall within the jurisdiction of congress to this extent only can the power be claim as the incident of any express grant to but there be clause of the constitution in which have be suggest that express authority to construct work of internal improvement have be confer on congress namely that which empower to exercise exclusive legislation in all case whatsoever over such district not exceed square as may by cession of particular states and the acceptance of congress become the seat of and to exercise like authority over all place purchase by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be for the erection of fort magazine arsenal dockyard and other needful building but any such supposition will be see to be groundless when this provision be carefully examine and compare with other part of the constitution be undoubtedly true that like authority refer back to exclusive legislation in all case whatsoever as apply to the|district|of|columbia and there be in the district no division of power as between the general and the|state|government in those place which the|united|state have purchase or retain within any of the states site for dockyard or fort for example legal process of the give state be still permit to run for some purpose and therefore the jurisdiction of the|united|state be not absolutely perfect but let assume for the argument 's sake that the jurisdiction of the|united|state in a tract of land cede to for the purpose of a dockyard or fort by virginia or maryland be as complete as in that cede by for the seat of government and then proceed to analyze this clause of the constitution provide that congress shall have certain legislative authority over all place purchase by the|united|state for certain purpose imply that congress have otherwise the power to purchase but where do congress get the power to purchase manifestly must be from some other clause of the constitution for be not confer by this one now as be a fundamental principle that the constitution be of limited power the authority to purchase must be confer in of the enumeration of legislative power so that the power to purchase be not an unlimited but be limit by the object in regard to which legislative authority be directly confer the other expression of the clause in question confirm this conclusion since the jurisdiction be give as to place purchase for certain enumerate object or purpose of these the first great division fort magazine arsenal and dockyard be obviously referable to recognize head of specific constitutional power there remain only the phrase and other needful building wherefore needful needful for any possible purpose within the whole range of the business of society and of government clearly not but only such building as be needful to the|united|state in the exercise of any of the power confer on congress thus need in the exercise of admit power not only fort magazine arsenal and dockyard but also court house prison custom house and post - office within the respective states place for the erection of such building may constitutionally purchase and have purchase the jurisdiction over belong to the|united|state so if the|general|government have the power to build a light house or a beacon may purchase a place for that object and have purchase then this clause of the constitution give jurisdiction over still the power to purchase for the purpose of erect a light house or beacon must depend on the existence of the power to erect and if that power exist must be seek after in some other clause of the constitution from whatever point of view therefore the subject be regard whether as a question of express or imply power the conclusion be the same that congress have no constitutional authority to carry on a system of internal improvement and in this conviction the system have be steadily oppose by the sound expositor of the function of the government be not to be suppose that in no conceivable case shall there be doubt as to whether a give object be or not a necessary incident of the military naval or any other power as man be imperfect so be method of utter thought human language save in expression for the exact science must always fail to preclude all possibility of controversy hence be that in branch of the subject the question of the power of congress to make appropriation in aid of navigation there be less of positive conviction than in regard to the general subject and therefore seem proper in this respect to revert to the history of the practice of the government among the very early act of the first session of congress be that for the establishment and support of light house approve by president washington on the|7th|of|august,|1789 which contain the follow provision that all expense which shall accrue from and after the|15th|day|of|august,|1789 in the necessary support maintenance and repair of all light house beacon buoy and public pier erect place or sink before the passing of this act at the entrance of or within any bay inlet harbor or port of the|united|state for render the navigation thereof easy and safe shall be defray out of the treasury of the|united|state provide nevertheless that none of the say expense shall continue to be so defrayed after the expiration of one|year from the|day aforesaid unless such light house beacon buoy and public pier shall in the meantime be cede to and vest in the|united|state by the state or states respectively in which the same may be together with the land and tenement thereunto belong and together with the jurisdiction of the same act contain appropriation for this class of public work be pass in and so on from year to year down to the present time and the tenor of these act when examine with reference to other part of the subject be worthy of special consideration be a remarkable fact that for a period of more|than|thirty|year after the adoption of the constitution all appropriation of this class be confine with scarcely an apparent exception to the construction of light house beacon buoy and public pier and the stakage of channel to render navigation safe and easy be true but only by indicate to the navigator obstacle in way not by remove those obstacle nor in any other respect change artificially the preexist natural condition of the earth and sea be obvious however that work of art for the removal of natural impediment to navigation or to prevent formation or for supply harbor where these do not exist be also mean of render navigation safe and easy and may in supposable case be the most efficient as well as the most economical of such mean nevertheless be not until the|year|1824 that in an act to improve the navigation of the river ohio and mississippi and in another act make appropriation for deepen the channel lead into the harbor of presque|isle on lake|erie and for repair plymouth|beach in massachusetts|bay have any example of an appropriation for the improvement of harbor in the nature of those provide for in the bill return by to the|house|of|representatives appear not probable that the abstinence of congress in this respect be attributable altogether to consideration of economy or to any failure to perceive that the removal of an obstacle to navigation may be not less useful than the indication of for avoidance and may be well assume that the course of legislation so long pursued be induce in whole or in part by solicitous consideration in regard to the constitutional power over such matter vest in congress other peculiarity in this course of legislation be not less remarkable be that when first take charge of lighthouse and beacon require the work and the land on which be situate to be cede to the|united|state and although for a time this precaution be neglect in the case of new work in the sequel be provide by general law that no light house should be construct on any site previous to the jurisdiction over the same being cede to the|united|state constitutional authority for the construction and support of many of the public work of this nature be certain may be find in the power of congress to maintain a navy and provide for the general defense but number and in many instance location preclude the idea of be fully justify as necessary and proper incident of that power and do not seem susceptible of be refer to any other of the specific power vest in congress by the constitution unless be that to raise revenue in so far as this relate to navigation the practice under all predecessor in office the express admission of some of and absence of denial by any sufficiently manifest belief that the power to erect light house beacon and pier be possess by the|general|government in the act of congress as have already see the inducement and object of the appropriation be expressly declare those appropriation be for light house beacon buoy and public pier erect or place within any bay inlet harbor or port of the|united|state for render the navigation thereof easy and safe if be contend that this review of the history of appropriation of this class lead to the inference that beyond the purpose of national defense and maintenance of a navy there be authority in the constitution to construct certain work in aid of navigation be at the same time to be remember that the conclusion thus deduce from contemporaneous construction and long continue acquiescence be directly suggestive of limitation of constitutionality as well as expediency regard the nature and the description of those aid to navigation which congress may provide as incident to the revenue power for at this point controversy begin not so much as to the principle as to application in accordance with long establish legislative usage congress may construct light house and beacon and provide as do other mean to prevent shipwreck on the coast of the|united|state but the|general|government can not go beyond this and make improvement of river and harbor of the nature and to the degree of all the provision of the bill of the last session of congress to justify such extended power have be urge that if be constitutional to appropriate money for the purpose of point out by the construction of light house or beacon where an obstacle to navigation exist be equally so to remove such obstacle or to avoid by the creation of an artificial channel that if the object be lawful then the mean adopt solely with reference to the end must be lawful and that therefore be not material constitutionally speak whether a give obstruction to navigation be indicate for avoidance or be actually avoid by excavate a new channel that if be a legitimate object of expenditure to preserve a ship from wreck by mean of a beacon or of revenue cutter must be not less so to provide place of safety by the improvement of harbor or where none exist by artificial construction and thence the argument naturally pass to the propriety of improve river for the benefit of internal navigation because all these object be of more or less importance to the commercial as well as the naval interest of the|united|state the answer to all this be that the question of open speedy and easy communication to and through all part of the country be substantially the same whether do by land or water that the us of road and canal in facilitate commercial intercourse and unite by community of interest the most remote quarter of the country by land communication be the same in nature as the us of navigable water and that therefore the question of the facility and aid to be provide to navigation by whatsoever mean be but a subdivision of the great question of the constitutionality and expediency of internal improvement by the|general|government in confirmation of this be to be remark that of the most important act of appropriation of this class that of the|year|1833 under the administration of president jackson by include together and provide for in bill as well river and harbor work as road work impliedly recognize the fact that be alike branch of the same great subject of internal improvement as the population territory and wealth of the country increase and settlement extend into remote region the necessity for additional mean of communication impress upon all mind with a force which have not be experience at the date of the formation of the constitution and more and more embarrassed those who be most anxious to abstain scrupulously from any exercise of doubtful power hence the recognition in the message of presidents jefferson madison and monroe of the eminent desirableness of such work with admission that some of could lawfully and should be conduct by the|general|government but with obvious uncertainty of opinion as to the line between such as be constitutional and such as be not such as ought to receive appropriation from congress and such as ought to be consign to private enterprise or the legislation of the several states this uncertainty have not be remove by the practical working of institution in later time for although the acquisition of additional territory and the application of steam to the propulsion of vessel have greatly magnify the importance of internal commerce this fact have at the same time complicate the question of the power of the|general|government over the present subject in fine a careful review of the opinion of all predecessor and of the legislative history of the country do not indicate any fix rule by which to decide what of the infinite variety of possible river and harbor improvement be within the scope of the power delegate by the constitution and the question still remain unsettled president jackson concede the constitutionality under suitable circumstance of the improvement of river and harbor through the agency of congress and president polk admit the propriety of the establishment and support by appropriation from the treasury of light house beacon buoy and other improvement within the bay inlet and harbor of the ocean and lake coast immediately connect with foreign commerce but if the distinction thus make rest upon the difference between foreign and domestic commerce can not be restrict thereby to the bay inlet and harbor of the ocean and lake because foreign commerce have already penetrate thousands|of|miles into the interior of the continent by mean of great river and will continue so to extend with the progress of settlement until reach the limit of navigability at the time of the adoption of the constitution the vast valley of the mississippi now teem with population and supply almost boundless resource be literally an unexplored wilderness advancement have outstrip even the most sanguine anticipation of the father of the republic and illustrate the fact that no rule be admissible which undertake to discriminate so far as regard river and harbor improvement between the atlantic or pacific coast and the great lake and river of the interior region of north|america indeed be quite erroneous to suppose that any such discrimination have ever exist in the practice of the government to the contrary of which be the significant fact before state that when after abstain from all such appropriation for more|than|thirty|year congress enter upon the policy of improve the navigation of river and harbor commence with the river mississippi and ohio the|congress|of|the|union adopt in this respect of the idea of that of the confederation have take heed to declare from time to time as occasion require either in act for dispose of the public land in the territories or in act for admit new states that all navigable river within the same shall be deem to be and remain public highway out of this condition of thing arise a question which at successive period of public annals have occupy the attention of the good mind in the union this question be what water be public navigable water so as not to be of state character and jurisdiction but of federal jurisdiction and character in the intent of the constitution and of congress a proximate but imperfect answer to this important question be furnish by the act of congress and the decision of the|supreme|court of the|united|state define the constitutional limit of the maritime jurisdiction of the|general|government that jurisdiction be entirely independent of the revenue power be not derive from that nor be measure thereby in that act of congress which in the|first|year|of|the government organize judicial system and which whether look to the subject the comprehensive wisdom with which be treat or the deference with which provision have come to be regard be only second to the constitution there be a section in which the statesman who frame the constitution have place on record construction of in this matte enact that the district court of the|united|state shall have exclusive cognizance of all civil case of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction include all seizure under the law of impost navigation or trade of the|united|state when the seizure be make on water which be navigable from the sea by vessel of burden within respective district as well as upon the high sea in this contemporaneous exposition of the constitution there be no trace or suggestion that nationality of jurisdiction be limit to the sea or even to tide water the law be mark by a sagacious apprehension of the fact that the|great|lake and the mississippi be navigable water of the|united|state even then before the acquisition of louisiana have make wholly own the territorial greatness of the west repudiate unequivocally the rule of the common law accord to which the question of whether a water be public navigable water or not depend on whether be salt or not and therefore in a river confine that quality to tide water a rule result from the geographical condition of england and applicable to an island with small and narrow stream the only navigable portion of which for ship be in immediate contact with the ocean but wholly inapplicable to the great inland fresh water sea of america and mighty river with secondary branch exceed in magnitude the large river of great|britain at a later period be true that in disregard of the more comprehensive definition of navigability afford by that act of congress be for a time hold by many that the rule establish for england be to be receive in the|united|state the effect of which be to exclude from the jurisdiction of the|general|government not only the water of the mississippi but also those of to this construction be with truth object that in so far as concern the lake be in fact sea although of fresh water that be the natural marine communication between a series of populous states and between and the possession of a foreign nation that be actually navigate by ship of commerce of the large capacity that have once be and may again be the scene of foreign war and that therefore be do violence to all reason to undertake by mean of an arbitrary doctrine of technical foreign law to exclude such water from the jurisdiction of in regard to the river mississippi be object that to draw a line across that river at the point of ebb and flood of tide and say that the part below be public navigable water and the part above not while in the latter the water be at least equally deep and navigable and commerce as rich as in the former with numerous port of foreign entry and delivery be to sanction a distinction artificial and unjust because regardless of the real fact of navigability may conceive that some such consideration lead to the enactment in the|year|1845 of an act in addition to that of declare the district court of the|united|state shall have possess and exercise the same jurisdiction in matter of contract and tort arise in upon or concern steamboat and other vessel of burden and upward enrol and license for the coast trade and at the time employ in business of commerce and navigation between port and place in different states and territories upon the lake and navigable water connect say lake as be now possess and exercise by the say court in case of the like steamboat and other vessel employ in navigation and commerce upon the high sea or tide water within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the|united|state be observable that the act of apply the jurisdiction of the|united|state to all water which be navigable from the sea for vessel of burden and that of extend the jurisdiction to enrol vessel of burden on the lake and navigable water connect say lake though not water navigable from the sea provide such vessel be employ between place in different states and territories thus appear that these provision of law in effect prescribe condition by which to determine whether any water be public navigable water subject to the authority of the|federal|government the condition include all water whether salt or fresh and whether of sea lake or river provide be capable of navigation by vessel of a certain tonnage and for commerce either between the|united|state and foreign country or between any or more of the|state or territories|of|the|union this exclude water wholly within any particular state and not use as the mean of commercial communication with any other state and subject to be improve or obstruct at will by the state within which may happen to be the constitutionality of these provision of statute have be call in question constitutionality have be maintain however by repeat decision of the|supreme|court of the|united|state and be therefore the law of the land by the concurrent act of the legislative the executive and the judicial department of the government regard as afford a criterion of what be navigable water and as such subject to the maritime jurisdiction of the|supreme|court and of congress these act be objectionable in this that the rule of navigability be an arbitrary one that congress may repeal the present rule and adopt a new one and that thus a legislative definition will be able to restrict or enlarge the limit of constitutional power yet this variableness of standard seem inherent in the nature of thing at any rate neither the|first|congress compose of the statesman of the era when the constitution be adopt nor any subsequent congress have afford the mean of attain great precision of construction as to this part of the constitution this reflection may serve to relieve from undeserved reproach an idea of of the great man of the republic president jackson seek amid all the difficulty of the subject for some practical rule of action in regard to appropriation for the improvement of river and harbor prescribe for own official conduct the rule of confine such appropriation to place below the port of entry or delivery establish by law see clearly as the author of the above mention act of and do that there be no inflexible natural line of discrimination between what be national and what local by mean of which to determine absolutely and unerringly at what point on a river the jurisdiction of the|united|state shall end perceive and of course admit that the constitution while confer on the|general|government some power of action to render navigation safe and easy have of necessity leave to congress much of discretion in this matter confide in the patriotism of congress to exercise that discretion wisely not permit to suppose possible that a port of entry or delivery would ever be establish by law for the express and only purpose of evade the constitution remain therefore to consider the question of the measure of discretion in the exercise by congress of the power to provide for the improvement of river and harbor and also that of the legitimate responsibility of the executive in the same relation in matter of legislation of the most unquestionable constitutionality be always material to consider what amount of public money shall be appropriate for any particular object the same consideration apply with augmented force to a class of appropriation which be in nature peculiarly prone to run to excess and which be make in the exercise of incidental power have intrinsic tendency to overstep the bound of constitutionality if an appropriation for improve the navigability of a river or deepen or protect a harbor have reference to military or naval purpose then rightfulness whether in amount or in the object to which be apply depend manifestly on the military or naval exigency and the subject matter afford own measure of legislative discretion but if the appropriation for such an object have no distinct relation to the military or naval want of the country and be wholly or even mainly intend to promote the revenue from commerce then the very vagueness of the propose purpose of the expenditure constitute a perpetual admonition of reserve and caution through disregard of this be undeniable that in many case appropriation of this nature have be make unwisely without accomplish beneficial result commensurate with the cost and sometimes for evil rather than good independently of dubious relation to the constitution among the radical change of the course of legislation in these matter which in judgment the public interest demand be a return to the primitive idea of congress which require in this class of public work as in all other a conveyance of the soil and a cession of the jurisdiction to the|united|state think this condition ought never to have be waive in the case of any harbor improvement of a permanent nature as where pier jetty sea wall and other like work be to be construct and maintain would powerfully tend to counteract endeavor to obtain appropriation of a local character and chiefly calculate to promote individual interest the want of such a provision be the occasion of abuse in regard to exist work expose to private encroachment without sufficient mean of redress by law indeed the absence in such case of a cession of jurisdiction have constitute of the constitutional objection to appropriation of this class be not easy to perceive any sufficient reason for require in the case of arsenal or fort which do not equally apply to all other public work if to be construct and maintain by congress in the exercise of a constitutional power of appropriation should be bring within the jurisdiction of the|united|state there be another measure of precaution in regard to such appropriation which seem to to be worthy of the consideration of congress be to make appropriation for every work in a separate bill so that each one shall stand on own independent merit and if pass shall do so under circumstance of legislative scrutiny entitle to be regard as of general interest and a proper subject of charge on the treasury of the union during that period of time in which the country have not come to look to congress for appropriation of this nature several of the states whose production or geographical position invite foreign commerce have enter upon plan for the improvement of harbor by and through mean of support draw directly from that commerce in virtue of an express constitutional power need for exercise only the permission of congress harbor improvement thus construct and maintain the expenditure upon be defray by the very facility afford be a voluntary charge on those only who see fit to avail of such facility and can be justly complain of by none on the other hand so long as these improvement be carry on by appropriation from the treasury the benefit will continue to inure to those alone who enjoy the facility afford while the expenditure will be a burden upon the whole country and the discrimination a double injury to place equally require improvement but not equally favor by appropriation these consideration add to the embarrassment of the whole question amply suffice to suggest the policy of confine appropriation by the|general|government to work necessary to the execution of undoubted power and of leave all other to individual enterprise or to the separate states to be provide for out of own resource or by recurrence to the provision of the constitution which authorize the states to lay duty of tonnage with the consent of congress transcript fellow citizens of the senate and of the|house|of|representatives the past have be an|eventful|year and will be hereafter refer to as a marked epoch in the history of the world while have be happily preserve from the calamity of war domestic prosperity have not be entirely uninterrupted the crop in portion of the country have be nearly cut off disease have prevail to a great extent than usual and the sacrifice of human life

reward the labor of the husbandman less bountifully than in precede season have leave with abundance for domestic want and a large surplus for exportation in the present therefore as in the past find ample ground for reverent thankfulness to the god of grace and providence for protect care and merciful dealing with as a people although attention have be arrest by painful interest in pass event yet country feel no more than the slight vibration of the convulsion which have shake europe as individual can not repress sympathy with human suffering nor regret for the cause which produce as a nation

many complication in which would otherwise have become involved notwithstanding this clearly define and well sustain course of action and geographical position so remote from europe increase disposition have be manifest by some of government to supervise and in certain respect to direct foreign policy in plan for adjust the balance of power among have assume to take into account and would constrain to conform conduct to view or another of the power of europe have from time to time undertake to enforce arbitrary regulation contrary in many respect to establish principle of international law that law the|united|states have in foreign intercourse uniformly respect and observe and can not recognize any such interpolation therein as the temporary interest of other may suggest do not admit that the sovereign of continent or of a particular community of state can legislate for all other leave the transatlantic nation to adjust political system in the way may think good for common welfare the independent power of this continent may well assert the right to be exempt from all annoying interference on part systematic abstinence from intimate political connection with distant foreign nation do not conflict with give the wide range to foreign commerce this distinction so clearly mark in history seem to have be overlook or disregard by some lead foreign state refusal to be bring within and subject to peculiar system have fear create a jealous distrust of conduct and induce on part occasional act of disturb effect upon foreign relation present attitude and past course give assurance which should not be question that purpose be not aggressive nor threatening to the safety and welfare of other nation military establishment in time of peace be adapt to maintain exterior defense and to preserve order among the aboriginal tribe within the limit of the union naval force be intend only for the protection of citizen abroad and of commerce diffuse as be over all the sea of the globe the|government|of|the|united|state be essentially pacific in policy stand prepared to repel invasion by the voluntary service of a patriotic people and provide no permanent mean of foreign aggression these consideration should allay all apprehension that be dispose to encroach on the right or endanger the security of other state some european power have regard with disquiet concern the territorial expansion of the|united|state this rapid growth have result from the legitimate exercise of sovereign right belong alike to all nation and by many liberally exercise under such circumstance could hardly have be expect that those among which have within a comparatively recent period subdue and absorb ancient kingdom plant standard on every continent and now possess or claim the control of the island of every ocean as appropriate domain would look with unfriendly sentiment upon the acquisition of this country in every instance honorably obtain or would feel justified in impute advancement to a spirit of aggression or to a passion for political predominance foreign commerce have reach a magnitude and extent nearly equal to that of the first maritime power of the earth and exceed that of any other over this great interest in which not only merchant but all class of citizen at least indirectly be concern be the duty of the executive and legislative branch of the government to exercise a careful supervision and adopt proper measure for protection the policy which have in view in regard to this interest embrace future as well as present security long experience have show that in general when the principal power of europe be engage in war the right of neutral nation be endanger this consideration lead in the progress of the|war|of|our|independence to the formation of the celebrated confederacy of armed neutrality a primary object of which be to assert the doctrine that free ship make free good except in the case of article contraband of war a doctrine which from the very commencement of national being have be a cherished idea of the statesman of this country at period or another every maritime power have by some solemn treaty stipulation recognize that principle and may have be hope that would come to be universally receive and respect as a rule of international law but the refusal of power prevent this and in the next great war which ensue that of the|french|revolution fail to be respect among the belligerent states of europe notwithstanding this the principle be generally admit to be a sound and salutary so much so that at the commencement of the exist war in europe great|britain and france announce purpose to observe for the present not however as a recognize international fight but as a mere concession for the time be the cooperation however of these powerful maritime nation in the interest of neutral right appear to to afford an occasion invite and justify on the part of the|united|state a renew effort to make the doctrine in question a principle of international law by mean of special convention between the several power of europe and america accordingly a proposition embrace not only the rule that free ship make free good except contraband article but also the less contested that neutral property other than contraband though on board enemy 's ship shall be exempt from confiscation have be submit by this government to those of europe and america russia act promptly in this matter and a convention be conclude between that country and the|united|state provide for the observance of the principle announce not only as between but also as between and all other nation which shall enter into like stipulation none of the other power have as yet take final action on the subject be not aware however that any objection to the propose stipulation have be make but on the contrary be acknowledge to be essential to the security of neutral commerce and the only apparent obstacle to general adoption be in the possibility that may be encumber by inadmissible condition the|king|of|the|two|sicily have express to minister at naples readiness to concur in proposition relative to neutral right and to enter into a convention on that subject the|king|of|prussia entirely approve of the project of a treaty to the same effect submit to but propose an additional article provide for the renunciation of privateering such an article for most obvious reason be much desire by nation have naval establishment large in proportion to foreign commerce if be adopt as an international rule the commerce of a nation have comparatively a small naval force would be very much at the mercy of enemy in case of war with a power of decide naval superiority the bare statement of the condition in which the|united|state would be place after have surrender the right to resort to privateer in the event of war with a belligerent of naval supremacy will show that this government could never listen to such a proposition the navy of the first maritime power in europe be at|least|ten time as large as that of the foreign commerce of the country be nearly equal and about equally expose to hostile depredation in war between that power and the|united|state without resort on part to mercantile marine the mean of enemy to inflict injury upon commerce would be tenfold great than our to retaliate could not extricate country from this unequal condition with such an enemy unless at once depart from present peaceful policy and become a great naval power nor would this country be better situate in war with of the secondary naval power though the naval disparity would be less the great extent and more expose condition of widespread commerce would give any of a like advantage over the proposition to enter into engagement to forego a resort to privateer in case this country should be force into war with a great naval power be not entitle to more favorable consideration than would be a proposition to agree not to accept the service of volunteer for operation on land when the honor or the right of country require to assume a hostile attitude confidently rely upon the patriotism of citizen not ordinarily devoted to the military profession to augment the army and the navy so as to make fully adequate to the emergency which call into action the proposal to surrender the right to employ privateer be professedly found upon the principle that private property of unoffende noncombatant though enemy should be exempt from the ravage of war but the propose surrender go but little way in carry out that principle which equally require that such private property should not be seize or molest by national ship of war should the lead power of europe concur in propose as a rule of international law to exempt private property upon the ocean from seizure by public armed cruiser as well as by privateer the|united|state will readily meet upon that broad ground since the adjournment of congress the ratification of the treaty between the|united|state and great|britain relative to coast fishery and to reciprocal trade with the|british|north|american|province have be exchange and some of anticipate advantage be already enjoy by although full execution be to abide certain act of legislation not yet fully perform so soon as be ratify great|britain open to commerce the free navigation of the river st.|lawrence and to fisherman unmoleste access to the shore and bay from which have be previously exclude on the coast of north|american|province in return for which ask for the introduction free of duty into the port of the|united|state of the fish catch on the same coast by british fisherman this be the compensation stipulate in the treaty for privilege of the high importance and value to the|united|state which be thus voluntarily yield before become effective the request seem to to be a reasonable but could not be accede to from want of authority to suspend law impose duty upon all foreign fish in the meantime the|treasury|department issue a regulation for ascertain the duty pay or secure by bond on fish catch on the coast of the|british|province and bring to market by british subject after the fishing ground have be make fully accessible to the citizen of the|united|state recommend to favorable consideration a proposition which will be submit to for authority to refund the duty and cancel the bond thus receive the|provinces|of|canada and new|brunswick have also anticipate the full operation of the treaty by legislative arrangement respectively to admit free of duty the product of the|united|state mention in the free list of the treaty and an arrangement similar to that regard british fish have be make for duty now chargeable on the product of those provinces enumerate in the same free list and introduce therefrom into the|united|state a proposition for refund which will in judgment be in like manner entitle to favorable consideration there be difference of opinion between the|united|state and great|britain as to the boundary line of the|territory|of|washington adjoin the british possession on the pacific which have already lead to difficulty on the part of the citizen and local authority of the government recommend that provision make for a commission to be join by on the part of her|britannic|majesty for the purpose of run and establish the line in controversy certain stipulation of the third and fourth article of the treaty conclude by the|united|state and great|britain in regard possessory right of the|hudsons|bay|company and property of the|pugets|sound|agricultural|company have give rise to serious dispute and be important to all concerned that summary mean of settle amicably should be devise have reason to believe that an arrangement can be make on just term for the extinguishment of the right in question embrace also the right of the|hudsons|bay|company to the navigation of the river columbia and therefore suggest to consideration the expediency of make a contingent appropriation for that purpose france be the early and efficient ally of the|united|state in struggle for independence from that time to the present with occasional slight interruption cordial relation of friendship have exist between the government and people of the country the kindly sentiment cherish alike by both nation have lead to extensive social and commercial intercourse which trust will not be interrupt or check by any casual event of an apparently unsatisfactory character the french consul at san|francisco be not long since bring into district court at that place by compulsory process as a witness in favor of another foreign consul in violation as the|french|government conceive of privilege under consular convention with france there be nothing in the transaction which could imply any disrespect to france or consul such explanation have be make as hope will be satisfactory subsequently misunderstand arise on the subject of the|french|government have as appear abruptly exclude the american minister to spain from pass through france on way from london to madrid but that government have unequivocally disavow any design to deny the right of transit to the minister of the|united|state and after explanation to this effect have resume journey and actually return through france to spain herewith lie before congress the correspondence on this subject between envoy at paris and the minister of foreign relation of the|french|government the position of affair with spain remain as at the close of the last session internal agitation assume very nearly the character of political revolution have recently convulse that country the late minister be violently expel from power and man of very different view in relation to internal affair have succeed since this change there have be no propitious opportunity to resume and press on negotiation for the adjustment of serious question of difficulty between the|spanish|government and the|united|state there be reason to believe that minister will find the present government more favorably inclined than the precede to comply with just demand and to make suitable arrangement for restore harmony and preserve peace between the country negotiation be pende with denmark to discontinue the practice of levy toll on vessel and cargo pass through the sound do not doubt that can claim exemption therefrom as a matter of right be admit on all hand that this exaction be sanction not by the general principle of the law of nation but only by special convention which most of the commercial nation have enter into with denmark the fifth article of treaty of with denmark provide that there shall not be pay on the vessel of the|united|state and cargo when pass through the sound high duty than those of the most favor nation this may be regard as an imply agreement to submit to the toll during the continuance of the treaty and consequently may embarrass the assertion of right to be release therefrom there be also other provision in the treaty which ought to be modify be to remain in force for ten|year and until one|year after either party should give notice to the other of intention to terminate deem expedient that the contemplate notice should be give to the|government|of|denmark the naval expedition dispatch about|two|year since for the purpose of establish relation with the|empire|of|japan have be ably and skillfully conduct to a successful termination by the officer to whom be intrust a treaty open certain of the port of that populous country have be negotiate and in order to give full effect thereto only remain to exchange ratification and adopt requisite commercial regulation the treaty lately conclude between the|united|state and mexico settle some of most embarrassing difficulty with that country but numerous claim upon for wrong and injury to citizen remain unadjusted and many new ease have be recently add to the former list of grievance legation have be earnest in endeavor to obtain from the|mexican|government a favorable consideration of these claim but hitherto without success this failure be probably in some measure to be ascribe to the disturbed condition of that country have be anxious desire to maintain friendly relation with the|mexican|republic and to cause right and territory to be respect not only by citizen but by foreigner who have resort to the|united|states for the purpose of organize hostile expedition against some of the|state of that republic the defenseless condition in which frontier have be leave have stimulate lawless adventurer to embark in these enterprise and greatly increase the difficulty of enforce obligation of neutrality regard as solemn duty to fulfill efficiently these obligation not only toward mexico but other foreign nation have exert all the power with which be invest to defeat such proceeding and bring to punishment those who by take a part therein violate law the energy and activity of civil and military authority have frustrate the design of those who meditate expedition of this character except in instance of these compose of foreigner be at first countenance and aid by the|mexican|government have be deceive as to real object the other small in number elude the vigilance of the magistrate at san|francisco and succeed in reach the mexican territory but the effective measure take by this government compel the abandonment of the undertaking the commission to establish the new line between the|united|state and mexico accord to the provision of the treaty of the|30th|of|december last have be organize and the work be already commence treaty with the|argentine|confederation and with the republics of uruguay and paraguay secure to the free navigation of the river la|plata and some of large tributary but the same success have not attend endeavor to open the amazon the reason in favor of the free use of that river have occasion to present fully in a former message and consider the cordial relation which have long exist between this government and brazil may be expect that pende negotiation will eventually reach a favorable result convenient mean of transit between the several part of a country be not only desirable for the object of commercial and personal communication but essential to existence under government separate as be the atlantic and pacific coast of the|united|state by the whole breadth of the continent still the inhabitant of each be closely bind together by community of origin and institution and by strong attachment to the union hence the constant and increase intercourse and vast interchange of commercial production between these remote division of the republic at the present time the most practicable and only commodious route for communication between be by the way of the isthmus of central|america be the duty of the government to secure these avenue against all danger of interruption in relation to central|america perplex question exist between the|united|state and great|britain at the time of the cession of california these as well as question which subsequently arise concern interoceanic communication across the isthmus be as be suppose adjust by the|treaty|of|april|19,|1850 but unfortunately have be reopen by serious misunderstanding as to the import of some or provision a readjustment of which be now under consideration minister at london have make strenuous effort to accomplish this desirable object but have not yet find possible to bring the negotiation to a termination as incidental to these question deem proper to notice an occurrence which happen in central|america near the close of the last session of congress so soon as the necessity be perceive of establish interoceanic communication across the isthmus a company be organize under the authority of the|state|of|nicaragua but compose for the most part of citizen of the|united|state for the purpose of open such a transit way by the river san|juan and lake|nicaragua which soon become an eligible and much use route in the transportation of citizen and property between the atlantic and pacific meanwhile and in anticipation of the completion and importance of this transit way a number of adventurer have take possession of the old spanish port at the mouth of the river san|juan in open defiance of the state or states of central|america which upon become independent have rightfully succeed to the local sovereignty and jurisdiction of spain these adventurer undertake to change the name of the place from san|juan|del|norte to greytown and though at first pretending to act as the subject of the fictitious sovereign of the|mosquito|indian subsequently repudiate the control of any power whatever assume to adopt a distinct political organization and declare an independent sovereign state if at some time a faint hope be entertain that may become a stable and respectable community that hope soon vanish proceed to assert unfounded claim to civil jurisdiction over punta|arenas a position on the opposite side of the river san|juan which be in possession under a title wholly independent of of citizen of the|united|state interested in the|nicaragua|transit|company and which be indispensably necessary to the prosperous operation of that route across the isthmus the company resist groundless claim whereupon proceed to destroy some of building and attempt violently to dispossess at a later period organize a strong force for the purpose of demolish the establishment at punta|arenas but this mischievous design be defeat by the interposition of of ship of war at that time in the harbor of san|juan subsequently to this in may last a body of man from greytown cross over to punta|arenas arrogate authority to arrest on the charge of murder a captain of of the steamboat of the|transit|company be well aware that the claim to exercise jurisdiction there would be resist then as have be on previous occasion go prepared to assert by force of arm minister to central|america happen to be present on that occasion believe that the captain of the steamboat be innocent for witness the transaction on which the charge be founder and believe also that the intrude party have no jurisdiction over the place where propose to make the arrest would encounter desperate resistance if persist in purpose interpose effectually to prevent violence and bloodshed the american minister afterwards visit greytown and whilst be there a mob include certain of the so call public functionary of the place surround the house in which be avow that have come to arrest by order of some person exercise the chief authority while parley with be wound by a missile from the crowd a boat dispatch from the american steamer to release from the perilous situation in which be understand to be be fire into by the town guard and compel to return these incident together with the know character of the population of greytown and excited state induce just apprehension that the life and property of citizen at punta arenas would be in imminent danger after the departure of the steamer with passenger for new|york unless a guard be leave for protection for this purpose and in order to insure the safety of passenger and property pass over the route a temporary force be organize at considerable expense to the|united|state for which provision be make at the last session of congress this pretend community a heterogeneous assemblage gather from various country and compose for the most part of black and person of mixed blood have previously give other indication of mischievous and dangerous propensity early in the|same|month property be clandestinely abstract from the depot of the|transit|company and take to greytown the plunderer obtain shelter there and pursuer be drive back by people who not only protect the wrongdoer and share the plunder but treat with rudeness and violence those who seek to recover property such in substance be the fact submit to consideration and prove by trustworthy evidence could not doubt that the case demand the interposition of this government justice require that reparation should be make for so many and such gross wrong and that a course of insolence and plunder tend directly to the insecurity of the life of numerous traveler and of the rich treasure belong to citizen pass over this transit way should be peremptorily arrest whatever may be in other respect the community in question in power to do mischief be not despicable be well provide with ordnance small arm and ammunition and may easily seize on the unarmed boat freight with million of property which pass almost daily within reach do not profess to belong to any regular government and have in fact no recognize dependence on or connection with anyone to which the|united|state or injure citizen may apply for redress or which could be hold responsible in any way for the outrage commit not stand before the world in the attitude of an organized political society be neither competent to exercise the right nor to discharge the obligation of a government be in fact a marauding establishment too dangerous to be disregard and too guilty to pass unpunished and yet incapable of be treat in any other way than as a piratical resort of outlaw or a camp of savage depredate on emigrant train or caravan and the frontier settlement of civilized state seasonable notice be give to the people of greytown that this government require to repair the injury have do to citizen and to make suitable apology for insult of minister and that a ship of war would be dispatch thither to enforce compliance with these demand but the notice pass unheeded thereupon a commander of the navy in charge of the sloop of war cyane be order to repeat the demand and to insist upon a compliance therewith find that neither the populace nor those assume to have authority over manifest any disposition to make the require reparation or even to offer excuse for conduct warn by a public proclamation that if do not give satisfaction within a time specify would bombard the town by this procedure afford opportunity to provide for personal safety to those also who desire to avoid loss of property in the punishment about to be inflict on the offending town furnish the mean of remove effect by the boat of own ship and of a steamer which procure and tender to for that purpose at length perceive no disposition on the part of the town to comply with requisition appeal to the commander of her|britannic|majesty 's schoon bermuda who be see to have intercourse and apparently much influence with the leader among to interpose and persuade to take some course calculate to save the necessity of resort to the extreme measure indicate in proclamation but that officer instead of accede to the request do nothing more than to protest against the contemplate bombardment no step of any sort be take by the people to give the satisfaction require no individual if any there be who regard as not responsible for the misconduct of the community adopt any mean to separate from the fate of the guilty the several charge on which the demand for redress be found have be publicly know to all for some time and be again announce to do not deny any of these charge offer no explanation nothing in extenuation of conduct but contumaciously refuse to hold any intercourse with the commander of the cyane by obstinate silence seem rather desirous to provoke chastisement than to escape there be ample reason to believe that this conduct of wanton defiance on part be imputable chiefly to the delusive idea that the|american|government would be deter from punish through fear of displease a formidable foreign power which presume to think look with complacency upon aggressive and insulting deportment toward the|united|state the cyane at length fire upon the town before much injury have be do the fire be twice suspend in order to afford opportunity for an arrangement but this be decline most of the building of the place of little value generally be in the sequel destroy but owe to the considerate precaution take by naval commander there be no destruction of life when the cyane be order to central|america be confidently hope and expect that no occasion would arise for a resort to violence and destruction of property and loss of life instruction to that effect be give to commander and no extreme act would have be requisite have not the people by extraordinary conduct in the affair frustrate all the possible mild measure for obtain satisfaction a withdrawal from the place the object of visit entirely defeat would under the circumstance in which the commander of the cyane find have be absolute abandonment of all claim of citizen for indemnification and submissive acquiescence in national indignity would have encourage in these lawless man a spirit of insolence and rapine most dangerous to the life and property of citizen at punta|arenas and probably embolden to grasp at the treasure and valuable merchandise continually pass over the nicaragua route certainly would have be most satisfactory to if the object of the cyane 's mission could have be consummate without any act of public force but the arrogant contumacy of the offender render impossible to avoid the alternative either to break up establishment or to leave impressed with the idea that may persevere with impunity in a career of insolence and plunder this transaction have be the subject of complaint on the part of some foreign power and have be characterize with more of harshness than of justice if comparison be to be institute would not be difficult to present repeat instance in the history of state stand in the very front of modern civilization where community far less offending and more defenseless than greytown have be chastise with much great severity and where not city only have be lay in ruin but human life have be recklessly sacrifice and the blood of the innocent make profusely to mingle with that of the guilty pass from foreign to domestic affair attention be naturally direct to the financial condition of the country always a subject of general interest for complete and exact information regard the finance and the various branch of the public service connect therewith refer to the report of the secretary of the treasury from which will appear that the amount of revenue during the|last|fiscal|year from all source be and that the public expenditure for the same period exclusive of payment on account of the public debt amount to during the same period the payment make in redemption of the public debt include interest and premium amount to to the sum total of the receipt of that|year be to be add a balance remain in the treasury at the commencement thereof amount to and at the close of the|same|year a corresponding balance amount to of receipt above expenditure also remain in the treasury although in the opinion of the secretary of the treasury the receipt of the|current|fiscal|year be not likely to equal in amount those of the last yet will undoubtedly exceed the amount of expenditure by at|least|$15,000,000 shall therefore continue to direct that the surplus revenue be apply so far as can be judiciously and economically do to the reduction of the public debt the amount of which at the commencement of the|last|fiscal|year be of which there have be pay on the|20th|day|of|november,|1854 the sum of leave a balance of outstanding public debt of only|$44,975,456 redeemable at different period within fourteen|years there be also remnant of other government stock most of which be already due and on which the interest have cease but which have not yet be present for payment amount to this statement exhibit the fact that the annual income of the government greatly exceed the amount of public debt which latter remain unpaid only because the time of payment have not yet mature and can not be discharge at once except at the option of public creditor who prefer to retain the security of the|united|state and the other fact not less striking that the annual revenue from all source exceed by many millions|of|dollar the amount need for a prudent and economical administration of the government the estimate present to congress from the different executive|department at the last session amount to and the appropriation make to the sum of of this excess of appropriation over estimate however more|than|twenty|million be applicable to extraordinary object have no reference to the usual annual expenditure among these object be embrace ten|million to meet the third article of the treaty between the|united|state and mexico so that in fact for object of ordinary expenditure the appropriation be limit to considerably less|than|$40,000,000 therefore renew recommendation for a reduction of the duty on import the report of the secretary of the treasury present a series of table show the operation of the revenue system for several|successive|year and as the general principle of reduction of duty with a view to revenue and not protection may now be regard as the settle policy of the country trust that little difficulty will be encounter in settle the detail of a measure to that effect in connection with this subject recommend a change in the law which recent experience have show to be essential to the protection of the government there be no express provision of law require the record and paper of a public character of the several officer of the government to be leave in office for the use of successor nor any provision declare felony on part to make false entry in the book or return false account in the absence of such express provision by law the outgoing officer in many instance have claim and exercise the right to take into own possession important book and paper on the ground that these be private property and have place beyond the reach of the government conduct of this character bring in several instance to the notice of the present secretary of the treasury naturally awaken suspicion and result in the disclosure that at port namely oswego toledo sandusky and milwaukee the treasury have by false entry be defraud within the|four|years|next|preceding|march,|1853 of the sum of the great difficulty with which the detection of these fraud have be attend in consequence of the abstraction of book and paper by the retire officer and the facility with which similar fraud in the public service may be perpetrate render the necessity of new legal enactment in the respect above refer to quite obvious for other material modification of the revenue law which seem to desirable refer to the report of the secretary of the treasury that report and the table which accompany furnish ample proof of the solid foundation on which the financial security of the country rest and of the salutary influence of the independent treasury system upon commerce and all monetary operation the experience of the last year furnish additional reason regret to say of a painful character for the recommendation heretofore make to provide for increase the military force employ in the territory inhabit by the indians the settler on the frontier have suffer much from the incursion of predatory band and large party of emigrant to pacific possession have be massacre with impunity the recurrence of such scene can only be prevent by teach these wild tribe the power of and responsibility to the|united|state from the garrison of frontier post be only possible to detach troop in small body and though these have on all occasion display a gallantry and a stern devotion to duty which on a large field would have command universal admiration have usually suffer severely in these conflict with superior number and have sometimes be entirely sacrifice all the disposable force of the army be already employ on this service and be know to be wholly inadequate to the protection which should be afford the public mind of the country have be recently shock by savage atrocity commit upon defenseless emigrant and border settlement and hardly less by the unnecessary destruction of valuable life where inadequate detachment of troop have undertake to furnish the need aid without increase of the military force these scene will be repeat be to be fear on a large scale and with more disastrous consequence congress be sure will perceive that the plain duty and responsibility of government be involve in this question and doubt not that prompt action may be confidently anticipate when delay must be attend by such fearful hazard the bill of the last session provide for an increase of the pay of the rank and file of the army have have beneficial result not only in facilitating enlistment but in obvious improvement in the class of man who enter the service regret that correspond consideration be not bestow on the officer who in view of character and service and the expense to which be necessarily subject receive at present what be in judgment inadequate compensation the valuable service constantly render by the army and inestimable importance as the nucleus around which the volunteer force of the nation can promptly gather in the|hour of danger sufficiently attest the wisdom of maintain a military peace establishment but the theory of system and the wise practice under require that any propose augmentation in time of peace be only commensurate with extended limit and frontier relation while scrupulously adhere to this principle find in exist circumstance a necessity for increase of military force and be believe that new regiment of infantry and of mount man will be sufficient to meet the present exigency if be necessary carefully to weigh the cost in a case of such urgency would be show that the additional expense would be comparatively light with the increase of the numerical force of the army should think be combine certain measure of reform in organic arrangement and administration the present organization be the result of partial legislation often direct to special object and interest and the law regulate rank and command have be adopt from the british code be not always applicable to service be not surprising therefore that the system should be deficient in the symmetry and simplicity essential to the harmonious working of several part and require a careful revision the present organization by maintain large staff corp or department separate many officer from that close connection with troop and those active duty in the field which be deem requisite to qualify for the varied responsibility of high command be the duty of the army staff mainly discharge by officer detach from regiment be believe that the special service would be equally well perform and the discipline and instruction of the army be improve while due regard to the security of the right of officer and to the nice sense of honor which should be cultivate among would seem to exact compliance with the establish rule of promotion in ordinary case still can hardly be doubt that the range of promotion by selection which be now practically confine to the grade of general officer may be somewhat extend with benefit to the public service observance of the rule of seniority sometimes lead especially in time of peace to the promotion of officer who after meritorious and even distinguished service may have be render by age or infirmity incapable of perform active duty and whose advancement therefore would tend to impair the efficiency of the army suitable provision for this class of officer by the creation of a retired list would remedy the evil without wound the just pride of man who by past service have establish a claim to high consideration in again commend this measure to the favorable consideration of congress would suggest that the power of place officer on the retired list be limit to one|year the practical operation of the measure would thus be test and if after the lapse of year there should be occasion to renew the provision can be reproduce with any improvement which experience may indicate the present organization of the artillery into regiment be liable to obvious objection the service of artillery be that of battery and an organization of battery into a corps of artillery would be more consistent with the nature of duty a large part of the troop now call artillery be and have be on duty as infantry the distinction between the arm be merely nominal this nominal artillery in service be disproportionate to the whole force and great than the want of the country demand therefore commend the discontinuance of a distinction which have no foundation in either the arm use or the character of the service expect to be perform in connection with the proposition for the increase of the army have present these suggestion with regard to certain measure of reform as the complement of a system which would produce the happy result from a give expenditure and which hope may attract the early attention and be deem worthy of the approval of congress the recommendation of the secretary of the navy have reference to more ample provision for the discipline and general improvement in the character of seamen and for the reorganization and gradual increase of the navy deem eminently worthy of favorable consideration the principle which have control policy in relation to the permanent military force by sea and land be sound consistent with the theory of system and should by no mean be disregard but limit the force to the object particularly set forth in the precede part of this message should not overlook the present magnitude and prospective extension of commercial marine nor fail to give due weight to the fact that besides the of atlantic seaboard have now a pacific coast stretch from mexico to the british possession in the north teem with wealth and enterprise and demand the constant presence of ship of war the augmentation of the navy have not keep pace with the duty properly and profitably assign to in time of peace and be inadequate for the large field of operation not merely in the present but still more in the progressively increase exigency of the commerce of the|united|state cordially approve of the propose apprentice system for national vessel recommend by the secretary of the navy the occurrence during the|last|few|month of marine disaster of the most tragic nature involve great loss of human life have produce intense emotion of sympathy and sorrow throughout the country may well be doubt whether all these calamitous event be wholly attributable to the necessary and inevitable danger of the sea the merchant mariner and shipbuilder of the|united|state be be true unsurpassed in far reach enterprise skill intelligence and courage by any other in the world but with the increase amount of commercial tonnage in the aggregate and the large size and improved equipment of the ship now construct a deficiency in the supply of reliable seamen begin to be very seriously feel the inconvenience may perhaps be meet in part by due regulation for the introduction into merchant ship of indent apprentice which while would afford useful and eligible occupation to numerous young man would have a tendency to raise the character of seamen as a class and be deserve of serious reflection whether may not be desirable to revise the exist law for the maintenance of discipline at sea upon which the security of life and property on the ocean must to so great an extent depend although much attention have already be give by congress to the proper construction and arrangement of steam vessel and all passenger ship still be believe that the resource of science and mechanical skill in this direction have not be exhaust no good reason exist for the mark distinction which appear upon statute between the law for protect life and property at sea and those for protect on land in most of the states severe penalty be provide to punish conductor of train engineer and other employ in the transportation of person by railway or by steamboat on river why should not the same principle be apply to act of insubordination cowardice or other misconduct on the part of master and mariner produce injury or death to passenger on the high sea beyond the jurisdiction of any of the states and where such delinquency can be reach only by the power of congress the whole subject be earnestly commend to consideration the report of the|postmaster general to which be refer for many interesting detail in relation to this important and rapidly extend branch of the public service show that the expenditure of the|year|ending|june|30,|1854 include of balance due to foreign office amount to the gross receipt during the same period amount to exhibit an expenditure over income of and a diminution of deficiency as compare with the|last|year of the increase of the revenue of the|department|for|the year end june over the|preceding|year be no proportionate increase however can be anticipate for the|current|year in consequence of the act of congress of june|23,|1854 provide for increase compensation to all postmaster from these statement be apparent that the|post office|department instead of defray expense accord to the design at the time of creation be now and under exist law must continue to be to no small extent a charge upon the general treasury the cost of mail transportation during the|year|ending|june|30,|1854 exceed the cost of the|preceding|year by again call attention to the subject of mail transportation by ocean steamer and commend the suggestion of the|postmaster|general to early attention during the|last|fiscal|year of the public land have be survey and 8,190,017|acre bring into market the number of acre sell be and the amount receive therefor the aggregate amount of land sell locate under military scrip and land warrant select as swamp land by states and by locate under grant for road be upward of the increase of land sell over the|previous|year be about|6,000,000|acres and the sale during the|first|two|quarters|of|the|current|year present the extraordinary result of five|and|a|half|million sell exceed by nearly|4,000,000|acre the sale of the correspond quarter of the|last|year the commendable policy of the government in relation to set apart public domain for those who have serve country in time of war be illustrate by the fact that since no less|than|30,000,000|acre have be apply to this object the suggestion which submit in annual message of last|year in reference to grant of land in aid of the construction of railway be less full and explicit than the magnitude of the subject and subsequent development would seem to render proper and desirable of the soundness of the principle then assert with regard to the limitation of the power of congress entertain no doubt but in application be not enough that the value of land in a particular locality may be enhance that in fact a large amount of money may probably be receive in a give time for alternate section than could have be realize for all the section without the impulse and influence of the propose improvement a prudent proprietor look beyond limited section of domain beyond present result to the ultimate effect which a particular line of policy be likely to produce upon all possession and interest the government which be trustee in this matter for the people of the states be bind to take the same wise and comprehensive view prior to and during the last session of congress upward of of land be withdraw from public sale with a view to application for grant of this character pende before congress a careful review of the whole subject lead to direct that all such order be abrogate and the land restore to market and instruction be immediately give to that effect the application at the last session contemplate the construction of more|than|5,000|mile of road and grant to the amount of nearly|20,000,000|acre of the public domain even admit the right on the part of congress to be unquestionable be quite clear that the propose grant would be productive of good and not evil the different project be confine for the present to eleven|state of this union and territory the reason assign for the grant show that be propose to put the work speedily in process of construction when reflect that since the commencement of the construction of railway in the|united|state stimulate as have be by the large dividend realize from the early work over the great thoroughfare and between the most important point of commerce and population encourage by state legislation and press forward by the amazing energy of private enterprise only|17,000|mile have be complete in all the states in a|quarter|of|a|century when see the crippled condition of many work commence and prosecute upon what be deem to be sound principle and safe calculation when contemplate the enormous absorption of capital withdraw from the ordinary channel of business the extravagant rate of interest at this moment pay to continue operation the bankruptcy not merely in money but in character and the inevitable effect upon finance generally can be doubt that the tendency be to run to excess in this matter be wise to augment this excess by encourage hope of sudden wealth expect to flow from magnificent scheme dependent upon the action of congress do the spirit which have produce such result need to be stimulate or check be not the well rule to leave all these work to private enterprise regulate and when expedient aid by the cooperation of states if construct by private capital the stimulant and the check go together and furnish a salutary restraint against speculative scheme and extravagance but be manifest that with the most effective guard there be danger of go too fast and too far may well pause before a proposition contemplate a simultaneous movement for the construction of railroad which in extent will equal exclusive of the great pacific road and all branch nearly|one third of the entire length of such work now complete in the|united|state and which can not cost with equipment the danger likely to result from combination of interest of this character can hardly be overestimate but independently of these consideration where be the accurate knowledge the comprehensive intelligence which shall discriminate between the relative claim of these twenty|eight propose road in eleven|state and territory where will begin and where end if to enable these company to execute propose work be necessary that the aid of the|general|government be primarily give the policy will present a problem so comprehensive in bearing and so important to political and social well being as to claim in anticipation the severest analysis entertain these view recur with satisfaction to the experience and action of the last session of congress as furnish assurance that the subject will not fail to elicit a careful reexamination and rigid scrutiny be intention to present on this occasion some suggestion regard internal improvement by the|general|government which want of time at the close of the last session prevent submitting on the return to the|house|of|representatives with objection of the bill entitle an act make appropriation for the repair preservation and completion of certain public work heretofore commence under the authority of law but the space in this communication already occupy with other matter of immediate public exigency constrain to reserve that subject for a special message which will be transmit to the houses|of|congress at an|early|day the judicial establishment of the united|states require modification and certain reform in the manner of conduct the legal business of the government be also much need but as have address upon both of these subject at length before have only to call attention to the suggestion then make former recommendation in relation to suitable provision for various object of deep interest to the inhabitant of the|district|of|columbia be renew many of these object partake largely of a national character and be important independently of relation to the prosperity of the only considerable organized community in the union entirely unrepresente in congress have thus present suggestion on such subject as appear to to be of particular interest or importance and therefore most worthy of consideration during the short remain period allot to the labor of the present congress forefather of the united colony in acquire independence and in round this republic of the|united|states|of|america have devolve upon descendant the great and the most noble trust ever commit to the hand of man impose upon all and especially such as the public will may have invest for the time be with political function the most sacred obligation have to maintain inviolate the great doctrine of the inherent right of popular self government to reconcile the large liberty of the individual citizen with complete security of the public order to render cheerful obedience to the law of the land to unite in enforce execution and to frown indignantly on all combination to resist to harmonize a sincere and ardent devotion to the institution of religion faith with the most universal religious toleration to preserve the right of all by cause each to respect those of the other to carry forward every social improvement to the uttermost limit of human perfectibility by the free action of mind upon mind not by the obtrusive intervention of misapply force to uphold the integrity and guard the limitation of organic law to preserve sacred from all touch of usurpation as the very palladium of political salvation the reserve right and power of the several states and of the people to cherish with loyal fealty and devoted affection this union as the only sure foundation on which the hope of civil liberty rest to administer government with vigilant integrity and rigid economy to cultivate peace and friendship with foreign nation and to demand and exact equal justice from all but to do wrong to none to eschew intermeddle with the national policy and the domestic repose of other government and to repel from own never to shrink from war when the right and the honor of the country call to arm but to cultivate in preference the art of peace seek enlargement of the right of neutrality and elevate and liberalize the intercourse of nation and by such just and honorable mean and such only whilst exalt the condition of the republic to assure to the legitimate influence and the benign authority of a great example amongst all the power of christendom under the solemnity of these conviction the blessing of almighty god be earnestly invoke to attend upon deliberation and upon all the counsel and act of the government to the end that with common zeal and common effort may in humble submission to the divine will cooperate for the promotion of the supreme good of transcript the repeal of the missouri compromise and the propriety of restoration constitute the subject of what be about to say as desire to present own connected view of this subject remark will not be specifically an answer to judge douglas yet as proceed the main point have present will arise and will receive such respectful attention as may be able to give wish further to say that do not propose to question the patriotism or to assail the motif of any man or class of man but rather to strictly confine to the naked merit of the question also wish to be no less than national in all the position may take and whenever take ground which other have think or may think narrow sectional and dangerous to the union hope to give a reason which will appear sufficient at least to some why think differently and as this subject be no other than part and parcel of the large general question of domestic slavery wish to make and to keep the distinction between the existing institution and the extension of so broad and so clear that no honest man can misunderstand and no dishonest one successfully misrepresent in order to a clear understanding of what the|missouri|compromise be a short history of the precede kindre subject will perhaps be proper when establish independence do not own or claim the country to which this compromise apply indeed strictly speak the confederacy then own no country at all the states respectively own the country within limit and some of own territory beyond strict state limit virginia thus own the north western territory the country out of which the principal part of ohio all indiana all illinois all michigan and all wisconsin have since be form also own perhaps within then limit what have since be form into the|state|of|kentucky north|carolina thus own what be now the state of tennessee and south|carolina and georgia in separate part own what be now mississippi and alabama connecticut think own the little remaining part of ohio be the same where now send giddings to congress and beat all creation at make cheese these territory together with the states constitute all the country over which the confederacy then claim any sort of jurisdiction be then live under the|articles|of|confederation which be supercede by the constitution several|years afterwards the question of cede these territory to the general government be set on foot mr. jefferson the author of the|declaration|of|independence and otherwise a chief actor in the revolution then a delegate in congress afterwards twice president who be be and perhaps will continue to be the most distinguished politician of history a virginian by birth and continue residence and withal a slave holder conceive the idea of take that occasion to prevent slavery ever go into the north western territory prevail on the|virginia|legislature to adopt view and to cede the territory make the prohibition of slavery therein a condition of the deed congress accept the cession with the condition and in the first ordinance which the act of congress be then call for the government of the territory provide that slavery should never be permit therein this be the famed ordinance of so often speak of thenceforward for one|year and until in the last scrap of this territory come into the union as the|state|of|wisconsin all party act in quiet obedience to this ordinance be now what jefferson foresaw and intend the happy home of teem million of free white prosperous people and no slave amongst thus with the author of the declaration of independence the policy of prohibit slavery in new territory originate thus away back of the constitution in the pure fresh free breath of the revolution the|state|of|virginia and the national congress put that policy in practice thus through sixty|odd of the good year of the republic do that policy steadily work to great and beneficent end and thus in those state and five|million of free enterprise people have before the rich fruit of this policy but now new light break upon now congress declare this ought never to have be and the like of must never be again the sacred right of self government be grossly violate by even find some man who draw first breath and every other breath of life under this very restriction now live in dread of absolute suffocation if should be restrict in the sacred right of take slave to nebraska that perfect liberty sigh for the liberty of make slave of other people jefferson never think of own father never think of never think of a|year|ago how fortunate for do not sooner become sensible of great misery oh how difficult be to treat with respect such assault upon all have ever really hold sacred but to return to history in purchase what be then call louisiana of france include the now state of louisiana arkansas missouri and iowa also the territory of minnesota and the present bone of contention kansas and nebraska slavery already exist among the french at new|orlean and to some extent at st.|louis in louisiana come into the union as a slave state without controversy in or missouri show sign of a wish to come in with slavery this be resist by northern member of congress and thus begin the first great slavery agitation in the nation this controversy last several|months and become very angry and exciting the|house|of|representative voting steadily for the prohibition of slavery in missouri and the senate voting as steadily against threat of break up the union be freely make and the ablest public man of the|day become seriously alarm at length a compromise be make in which like all compromise both side yield something be a law pass on the|6th|day|of|march,|1820 provide that missouri may come into the union with slavery but that in all the remain part of the territory purchase of france which lie north of and north latitude slavery should never be permit this provision of law be the|missouri|compromise in exclude slavery north of the line the same language be employ as in the|ordinance|of|'87 directly apply to iowa minnesota and to the present bone of contention kansas and nebraska whether there should or should not be slavery south of that line nothing be say in the law but arkansas constitute the principal remain part south of the line and have since be admit as a slave state without serious controversy more recently iowa north of the line come in as a free state without controversy still later minnesota north of the line have a territorial organization without controversy texas principally south of the line and west|of|arkansas though originally within the purchase from france have in be trade off to spain in treaty for the acquisition of florida have thus become a part of mexico mexico revolutionize and become independent of spain american citizen begin settle rapidly with slave in the southern part of texas soon revolutionize against mexico and establish an independent government of own adopt a constitution with slavery strongly resemble the constitution of slave state by still another rapid move texas claim a boundary much further west than when part with in be bring back to the|united|state and admit into the union as a slave state there then be little or no settlement in the northern part of texas a considerable portion of which lie north of the missouri line and in the resolution admit into the union the missouri restriction be expressly extend westward across territory this be in only|nine|years|ago thus originate the|missouri|compromise and thus have be respect down to and even four|years|later in distinguished senator in a public address hold the following language in relation to the missouri compromise have be in practical operation for about|a|quarter|of|a|century and have receive the sanction and approbation of man of all party in every section of the union have allay all sectional jealousy and irritation grow out of this vexed question and harmonize and tranquilize the whole country have give to henry|clay as prominent champion the proud sobriquet of the|“great|pacificator and by that title and for that service political friend have repeatedly appeal to the people to rally under standard as a presidential candidate as the man who have exhibit the patriotism and the power to suppress an unholy and treasonable agitation and preserve the union be not aware that any man or any party from any section of the union have ever urge as an objection to mr. clay that be the great champion of the missouri compromise on the contrary the effort be make by the opponent of mr. clay to prove that be not entitle to the exclusive merit of that great patriotic measure and that the honor be equally due to other as well as to for secure adoption that have origin in the heart of all patriotic man who desire to preserve and perpetuate the blessing of glorious union an origin akin that of the constitution of the|united|state conceive in the same spirit of fraternal affection and calculate to remove forever the only danger which seem to threaten at some distant day to sever the social bond of union all the evidence of public opinion at that|day seem to indicate that this compromise have be canonize in the heart of the american people as a sacred thing which no ruthless hand would ever be reckless enough to disturb do not read this extract to involve judge douglas in an inconsistency if afterwards think have be wrong be right for to change bring this forward merely to show the high estimate place on the missouri compromise by all party up to so late as the|year|1849 but go back a little in point of time war with mexico break out in when congress be about adjourn that session president polk ask to place two|millions|of|dollar under control to be use by in the recess if find practicable and expedient in negociate a treaty of peace with mexico and acquire some part of territory a bill be duly get up for the purpose and be progress swimmingly in the|house|of|representatives when a member by the name of david|wilmot a democrat from pennsylvania move as an amendment “ provide that in any territory thus acquire there shall never be slavery this be the origin of the far famed “ wilmot|proviso create a great flutter but stick like wax be vote into the bill and the bill pass with through the house the senate however adjourn without final action on and so both appropriation and proviso be lose for the time the war continue and at the next session the president renew request for the appropriation enlarge the amount think to three|million again come the proviso and defeat the measure congress adjourn again and the war go on in dec.,|1847 the new congress assemble be in the low house that term the “ wilmot proviso or the principle of be constantly come up in some shape or other and think may venture to say vote for at|least|forty time during the short term be there the senate however hold in check and never become law in the|spring|of|1848 a treaty of peace be make with mexico by which obtain that portion of country which now constitute the territory of new|mexico and utah and the now state of california by this treaty be defeat as so far as be intend to be a condition of the acquisition of territory friend however be still determined to find some way to restrain slavery from get into the new country this new acquisition lie directly west of old purchase from france and extend west to the pacific ocean and be so situate that if the missouri line should be extend straight west the new country would be divide by such extended line leave some north and some south of on judge douglas ' motion a bill or provision of a bill pass the senate to so extend the missouri line the proviso man in the house include vote down because by implication give up the southern part to slavery while be bent on have all free in the|fall|of|1848 the gold mine be discover in california this attract people to with unprecedented rapidity so that on or soon after the meeting of the new congress in dec.,|1849 already have a population of nearly|a|hundred|thousand have call a convention form a state constitution exclude slavery and be knock for admission into the union the proviso man of course be for let in but the senate always true to the other side would not consent to admission and there california stand keep out of the union because would not let slavery into border under all the circumstance perhaps this be not wrong there be other point of dispute connect with the general question of slavery which equally need adjustment the south clamor for a more efficient fugitive slave law the north clamor for the abolition of a peculiar specie of slave trade in in connection with which in view from the window of the capitol a sort of negro livery stable where drove of negro be collect temporarily keep and finally take to southern market precisely like drove of horse have be openly maintain for fifty|years utah and new|mexico need territorial government and whether slavery should or should not be prohibit within be another question the indefinite western boundary of texas be to be settle be receive a slave state and consequently the farther west the slavery man could push boundary the more slave country secure and the farther east the slavery opponent could thrust the boundary back the less slave ground be secure thus this be just as clearly a slavery question as any of the other these point all need adjustment and be all hold up perhaps wisely to make help to adjust another the union now as in be think to be in danger and devotion to the union rightfully incline man to yield somewhat in point where nothing else could have so incline a compromise be finally effect the south get new fugitive slave law and the north get california the far good part of acquisition from mexico as a free state the south get a provision that new|mexico and utah when admit as states may come in with or without slavery as may then choose and the north get the slave trade abolish in the north get the western boundary of texas thence further back eastward than the south desire but in turn give texas ten|millions|of|dollars with which to pay old debt this be the compromise of precede the presidential election of each of the great political party democrat and whig meet in convention and adopt resolution endorse the compromise of as a finality a final settlement so far as these party could make so of all slavery agitation previous to this in the|illinois|legislature have indorse during this long period of time nebraska have remain substantially an uninhabited country but now emigration to and settlement within begin to take place be about|one|third as large as the present united|stat and importance so long overlook begin to come into view the restriction of slavery by the missouri compromise directly apply to in fact be first make and have since be maintain expressly for in a bill to give a territorial government pass the|house|of|representatives and in the hand of judge douglas fail of pass the senate only for want of time this bill contain no repeal of the missouri compromise indeed when be assail because do not contain such repeal judge douglas defend in exist form on january|4th,|1854 judge douglas introduce a new bill to give nebraska territorial government accompany this bill with a report in which last expressly recommend that the missouri compromise shall neither be affirm nor repeal before long the bill be so modify as to make territory instead of call the southern kansas also about|a|month after the introduction of the bill on the judge 's own motion be so amend as to declare the missouri compromise inoperative and void and substantially that the people who go and settle there may establish slavery or exclude as may see fit in this shape the bill pass both branch of congress and become a law this be the repeal of the|missouri|compromise the forego history may not be precisely accurate in every particular but be sure be sufficiently so for all the us shall attempt to make of and in have before the chief material enable to correctly judge whether the repeal of the|missouri|compromise be right or wrong think and shall try to show that be wrong wrong in direct effect let slavery into kansas and nebraska and wrong in prospective principle allow to spread to every other part of the wide world where man can be find inclined to take this declare indifference but as must think covert real zeal for the spread of slavery can not but hate hate because of the monstrous injustice of slavery hate because deprive republican example of just influence in the world enable the enemy of free institution with plausibility to taunt as hypocrite cause the real friend of freedom to doubt sincerity and especially because force so many really good man amongst into an open war with the very fundamental principle of civil liberty criticise the|declaration|of|independence and insist that there be no right principle of action but self interest before proceed let say think have no prejudice against the southern people be just what would be in situation if slavery do not now exist amongst would not introduce if do now exist amongst should not instantly give up this believe of the masse north and south doubtless there be individual on both side who would not hold slave under any circumstance and other who would gladly introduce slavery anew if be out of existence know that some southern man do free slave go north and become tip top abolitionist while some northern one go south and become most cruel slave master when southern people tell be no more responsible for the origin of slavery than acknowledge the fact when be say that the institution exist and that be very difficult to get rid of in any satisfactory way can understand and appreciate the saying surely will not blame for not do what should not know how to do if all earthly power be give should not know what to do as to the exist institution first impulse would be to free all the slave and send to liberia,---to own native land but a moment 's reflection would convince that whatever of high hope as think there be there may be in this in the long run sudden execution be impossible if be all land there in a day would all perish in the|next|ten|day and there be not surplus shipping and surplus money enough in the world to carry there in many time ten|day what then free all and keep among as underling be quite certain that this better condition think would not hold in slavery at any rate yet the point be not clear enough for to denounce people upon what next free and make politically and socially equal own feeling will not admit of this and if would well know that those of the great mass of white people will not whether this feeling accord with justice and sound judgment be not the sole question if indeed be any part of a universal feeling whether well or ill found can not be safely disregard can not then make equal do seem to that system of gradual emancipation may be adopt but for tardiness in this will not undertake to judge brother of the south when remind of constitutional right acknowledge not grudgingly but fully and fairly and would give any legislation for the reclaiming of fugitive which should not in stringency be more likely to carry a free man into slavery than ordinary criminal law be to hang an innocent but all this to judgment furnish no more excuse for permit slavery to go into own free territory than would for revive the african slave trade by law the law which forbid the bringing of slave from africa and that which have so long forbid the take to nebraska can hardly be distinguish on any moral principle and the repeal of the former could find quite as plausible excuse as that of the latter the argument by which the repeal of the missouri compromise be seek to be justify be these first that the nebraska country need a territorial government second that in various way the public have repudiate and demand the repeal and therefore should not now complain of and lastly that the repeal establish a principle which be intrinsically right will attempt an answer to each of in turn first then if that country be in need of a territorial organization could not have have as well without as with the repeal iowa and minnesota to both of which the missouri restriction apply have without repeal each in succession territorial organization and even a bill for nebraska be within an ace of pass without the repeal clause and this in the hand of the same man who be now the champion of repeal why no necessity then for the repeal but still later when this very bill be first bring in contain no repeal but say because the public have demand or rather command the repeal the repeal be to accompany the organization whenever that should occur now deny that the public ever demand any such thing ever repudiate the missouri compromise ever command repeal deny and call for the proof be not contend believe that any such command have ever be give in express term be only say that be do in principle the support of the|wilmot|proviso be the first fact mention to prove that the missouri restriction be repudiate in principle and the second be the refusal to extend the missouri line over the country acquire from mexico these be near enough alike to be treat together the one be to exclude the chance of slavery from the whole new acquisition by the lump and the other be to reject a division of by which one|half be to be give up to those chance now whether this be a repudiation of the missouri line in principle depend upon whether the missouri law contain any principle require the line to be extend over the country acquire from mexico contend do not insist that contain no general principle but that be in every sense specific that term limit to the country purchase from france be undenied and undeniable could have no principle beyond the intention of those who make do not intend to extend the line to country which do not own if intend to extend in the event of acquire additional territory why do not say so be just as easy to say that in all the country west of the mississippi which now own or may hereafter acquire there shall never be slavery as to say what do say and would have say if have mean an intention to extend the law be not only not mention in the law but be not mention in any contemporaneous history both the law and the history of the time be a blank as to any principle of extension and by neither the know rule for construe statute and contract nor by common sense can any such principle be infer another fact show the specific character of the missouri law show that intend no more than express show that the line be not intend as a universal dividing line between free and slave territory present and prospective north of which slavery could never go be the fact that by that very law missouri come in as a slave state north of the line if that law contain any prospective principle the whole law must be look to in order to ascertain what the principle be and by this rule the south could fairly contend that inasmuch as get slave state north of the line at the inception of the law have the right to have another give north of occasionally now and then in the indefinite westward extension of the line this demonstrate the absurdity of attempt to deduce a prospective principle from the missouri compromise line when vote for the|wilmot|proviso be vote to keep slavery out of the whole missouri acquisition and little do think be thereby vote to let into nebraska lay several|hundred|miles distant when vote against extend the missouri line little do think be vote to destroy the old line then of near thirty|years stand to argue that thus repudiate the|missouri|compromise be no less absurd than would be to argue that because have so far forborne to acquire cuba have thereby in principle repudiate former acquisition and determine to throw out of the union no less absurd than would be to say that because may have refuse to build an addition to house thereby have decide to destroy the exist house and if catch set fire to house will turn upon and say instructed to do the most conclusive argument however that while vote for the|wilmot|proviso and while vote against the extension of the missouri line never think of disturb the original missouri|compromise be find in the fact that there be then and still be an unorganized tract of fine country nearly as large as the state of missouri lie immediately west of arkansas and south of the missouri compromise line and that never attempt to prohibit slavery as to wish particular attention to this adjoin the original missouri|compromise line by northern boundary and consequently be part of the country into which by implication slavery be permit to go by that compromise there have lie open ever since and there still lie and yet no effort have be make at any time to wrest from the south in all struggle to prohibit slavery within mexican acquisition never so much as lift a finger to prohibit as to this tract be not this entirely conclusive that at all time have hold the|missouri|compromise as a sacred thing even when against as well as when for senator douglas sometimes say the missouri line be in principle only an extension of the line of the ordinance of --that be to say an extension of the ohio river think this be weak enough on face will remark however that as a glance at the map will show the missouri line be a long way farther south than the ohio and that if senator in propose extension have stick to the principle of jog southward perhaps may not have be vote down so readily but next be say that the compromise of and the ratification of by both political party in establish a new principle which require the repeal of the|missouri|compromise this again deny deny and demand the proof have already state fully what the compromise of be the particular part of those measure for which the virtual repeal of the missouri compromise be seek to be infer for be admit contain nothing about in express term be the provision in the utah and new|mexico law which permit when seek admission into the|union|as|states to come in with or without slavery as shall then see fit now insist this provision be make for utah and new|mexico and for no other place whatever have no more direct reference to nebraska than have to the territory of the moon but say have reference to nebraska in principle let see the north consent to this provision not because consider right in but because be compensate pay for at the same time get california into the union as a free state this be far the good part of all have struggle for by the|wilmot|proviso also get the area of slavery somewhat narrow in the settlement of the boundary of texas also get the slave trade abolish in for all these desirable object the north could afford to yield something and do yield to the south the utah and new|mexico provision do not mean that the whole north or even a majority yield when the law pass but enough yield when add to the vote of the south to carry the measure now can be pretend that the principle of this arrangement require to permit the same provision to be apply to nebraska without any equivalent at all give another free state press the boundary of texas still further back give another step toward the destruction of slavery in the district and present a similar case but ask not to repeat for nothing what pay for in the first instance if wish the thing again pay again that be the principle of the compromise of if indeed have any principle beyond specific term be the system of equivalent again if congress at that time intend that all future territory should when admit as states come in with or without slavery at own option why do not say so with such an universal provision all know the bill could not have pass do then could establish a principle contrary to own intention still further if intend to establish the principle that wherever congress have control should be leave to the people to do as think fit with slavery why do not authorize the people of the|district|of|columbia at adoption to abolish slavery within these limit personally know that this have not be leave undone because be unthought of be frequently speak of by member of congress and by citizen of washington six|years|ago and hear no one express a doubt that a system of gradual emancipation with compensation to owner would meet the approbation of a large majority of the white people of the district but without the action of congress could say nothing and congress say no in the measure of congress have the subject of slavery in the district expressly in hand if be then establish the principle of allow the people to do as please with slavery why do not apply the principle to that people again be claim that by the resolutions of the illinois legislature pass in the repeal of the missouri compromise be demand this deny also whatever may be work out by a criticism of the language of those resolution the people have never understand as be any more than an endorsement of the compromise of and a release of senator from vote for the|wilmot|proviso the whole people be live witness that this only be view finally be ask “ if do not mean to apply the utah and new|mexico provision to all future territory what do mean when in endorse the compromise of for can answer this question most easily mean not to ask a repeal or modification of the fugitive slave law mean not to ask for the abolition of slavery in mean not to resist the admission of utah and new|mexico even should ask to come in as slave states mean nothing about additional territory because as understand then have no territory whose character as to slavery be not already settle as to nebraska regard character as be fix by the missouri compromise for thirty|year as unalterably fix as that of own home in illinois as to new acquisition say “ sufficient unto the|day be the evil thereof when make new acquaintance will as heretofore try to manage some how that be answer that be what mean and say and appeal to the people to say each for whether that be not also the universal meaning of the free states and now in turn let ask a few question if by any or all these matter the repeal of the missouri compromise be command why be not the command sooner obeyed why be the repeal omit in the nebraska bill of why be omit in the original bill of why in the accompanying report be such a repeal characterize as a departure from the course pursue in and continued omission recommend be aware judge douglas now argue that the subsequent express repeal be no substantial alteration of the bill this argument seem wonderful to be as if one should argue that white and black be not different admit however that there be a literal change in the bill and that make the change in deference to other senator who would not support the bill without this prove that those other senators think the change a substantial and that the judge think opinion worth defer to own opinion therefore seem not to rest on a very firm basis even in own mind and suppose the world believe and will continue to believe that precisely on the substance of that change this whole agitation have arise conclude then that the public never demand the repeal of the missouri compromise now come to consider whether the repeal with avowed principle be intrinsically right insist that be not take the particular case a controversy have arise between the advocate and opponent of slavery in relation to establishment within the country have purchase of france the southern and then good part of the purchase be already in as a slave state the controversy be settle by also let missouri in as a slave state but with the agreement that within all the remain part of the purchase north of a certain line there should never be slavery as to what be to be do with the remain part south of the line nothing be say but perhaps the fair implication be that should come in with slavery if should so choose the southern part except a portion heretofore mention afterwards do come in with slavery as the state of arkansas all these many year since the northern part have remain a wilderness at length settlement begin in also in due course iowa come in as a free state and minnesota be give a territorial government without remove the slavery restriction finally the sole remain part north of the line kansas and nebraska be to be organize and be propose and carry to blot out the old dividing line of four|year standing and to open the whole of that country to the introduction of slavery now this to mind be manifestly unjust after an angry and dangerous controversy the party make friend by divide the bone of contention the party first appropriate own share beyond all power to be disturb in the possession of and then seize the share of the other party be as if starve man have divide only loaf the one have hastily swallow half and then grab the other half just as be put to mouth let here drop the main argument to notice what consider rather an inferior matter be argue that slavery will not go to kansas and nebraska in any event this be a palliation a lullaby have some hope that will not but let not be too confident as to climate a glance at the map show that there be slave states delaware maryland virginia kentucky and missouri and also all north of the missouri compromise line the census return of show that within these there be slave be fourth of all the slave in the nation be not climate then that will keep slavery out of these territory be there any thing in the peculiar nature of the country missouri adjoin these territory by entire western boundary and slavery be already within every of western county have even hear say that there be more slave in proportion to white in the north western county of missouri than within any county of the state slavery press entirely up to the old western boundary of the state and when rather recently a part of that boundary at the north west be move out a little farther west slavery follow on quite up to the new line now when the restriction be remove what be to prevent from go still further climate will not no peculiarity of the country will nothing in nature will will the disposition of the people prevent those nearest the scene be all in favor of the extension the yankee who be oppose to may be more numerous but in military phrase the battle field be too far from base of operation but be say there now be no law in nebraska on the subject of slavery and that in such case take a slave there operate freedom that be good book law but be not the rule of actual practice wherever slavery be have be first introduce without law the old law find concern be not law introduce but regulate as an already exist thing a white man take slave to nebraska now who will inform the negro that be free who will take before court to test the question of freedom in ignorance of legal emancipation be keep chop splitting and plowing other be bring and move on in the same track at last if ever the time for voting come on the question of slavery the institution already in fact exist in the country and can not well be remove the fact of presence and the difficulty of removal will carry the vote in favor keep out until a vote be take and a vote in favor of can not be get in any population of forty|thousand on earth who have be draw together by the ordinary motif of emigration and settlement to get slave into the country simultaneously with the white in the incipient stage of settlement be the precise stake play for and win in this nebraska measure the question be ask if slave will go in notwithstanding the general principle of law liberate why would not equally go in against positive statute law?---go in even if the missouri restriction be maintain answer because take a much bold man to venture in with property in the latter case than in the former because the positive congressional enactment be know to and respect by all or nearly all whereas the negative principle that no law be free law be not much know except among lawyer have some experience of this practical difference in spite of the|ordinance|of|'87 a few negro be bring into illinois and hold in a state of quasi slavery not enough however to carry a vote of the people in favor of the institution when come to form a constitution but in the adjoin missouri country where there be no ordinance of no restriction be carry time nay a time as fast and actually make a slave state this be fact naked fact another lullaby argument be that take slave to new country do not increase number do not make any slave who otherwise would be free there be some truth in this and be glad of but not wholly true the african slave trade be not yet effectually suppress and if make a reasonable deduction for the white people amongst who be foreigner and the descendant of foreigner arrive here since shall find the increase of the black population out run that of the white to an extent unaccountable except by suppose that some of too have be come from africa if this be so the opening of new country to the institution increase the demand for and augment the price of slave and so do in fact make slave of freeman by cause to be bring from africa and sell into bondage but however this may be know the opening of new country to slavery tend to the perpetuation of the institution and so do keep man in slavery who otherwise would be free this result do not feel like favor and be under no legal obligation to suppress feeling in this respect equal justice to the south be say require to consent to the extending of slavery to new country that be to say inasmuch as do not object to take hog to nebraska therefore must not object to take slave now admit this be perfectly logical if there be no difference between hog and negro but while thus require to deny the humanity of the negro wish to ask whether of the south yourself have ever be willing to do as much be kindly provide that of all those who come into the world only a small percentage be natural tyrant that percentage be no large in the slave states than in the free the great majority south as well as north have human sympathy of which can no more div than can of sensibility to physical pain these sympathy in the bosom of the southern people manifest in many way sense of the wrong of slavery and consciousness that after all there be humanity in the negro if deny this let address a few plain question in join the north almost unanimously in declare the african slave trade piracy and in annex to the punishment of death why do do this if do not feel that be wrong why do join in provide that man should be hang for the practice be no more than bring wild negro from africa to sell to such as would buy but never think of hang man for catch and sell wild horse wild buffaloes or wild bear again have amongst a sneak individual of the class of native tyrant know as the slave dealer watch necessity and crawl up to buy slave at a speculating price if can not help sell to but if can help drive from door despise utterly do not recognize as a friend or even as an honest man child must not play with may rollick freely with the little negro but not with the “ slave dealer child if be oblige to deal with try to get through the job without so much as touch be common with to join hand with the man meet but with the slave dealer avoid the ceremony instinctively shrink from the snaky contact if grow rich and retire from business still remember and still keep up the ban of non - intercourse upon and family now why be this do not so treat the man who deal in corn cattle or tobacco and yet again there be in the|united|state and territory include free black at per head be worth over million of dollar how come this vast amount of property to be run about without owner do not see free horse or free cattle run at large how be this all these free black be the descendant of slave or have be slave and would be slave now but for something which have operate on white owner induce at vast pecuniary sacrifice to liberate what be that something be there any mistake in all these case be sense of justice and human sympathy continually tell that the poor negro have some natural right to that those who deny and make mere merchandise of deserve kicking contempt and death and now why will ask to deny the humanity of the slave and estimate only as the equal of the hog why ask to do what will not do why ask to do for nothing what two|hundred|million|of|dollar could not induce to do but great argument in the support of the repeal of the missouri compromise be still to come that argument be the sacred right of self government seem distinguished senator have find great difficulty in get antagonist even in the senate to meet fairly on this argument some poet have say “ fools rush in where angel fear to tread at the hazzard of be think of the fool of this quotation meet that argument rush in take that bull by the horn trust understand and truly estimate the right of self government faith in the proposition that each man should do precisely as please with all which be exclusively own lie at the foundation of the sense of justice there be in extend the principle to community of man as well as to individual so extend because be politically wise as well as naturally just politically wise in save from broil about matter which do not concern here or at washington would not trouble with the oyster law of virginia or the cranberry law of indiana the doctrine of self government be right absolutely and eternally right but have no just application as here attempt or perhaps should rather say that whether have such just application depend upon whether a negro be not or be a man if be not a man why in that case who be a man may as a matter of self government do just as please with but if the negro be a man be not to that extent a total destruction of self government to say that too shall not govern when the white man govern that be self government but when govern and also govern another man that be more than self government that be despotism if the negro be a man why then ancient faith teach that all man be create equal and that there can be no moral right in connection with man be make a slave of another judge douglas frequently with bitter irony and sarcasm paraphrase argument by say the white people of nebraska be good enough to govern but be not good enough to govern a few miserable negro well doubt not that the people of nebraska be and will continue to be as good as the average of people elsewhere do not say the contrary what do say be that no man be good enough to govern another man without that other 's consent say this be the lead principle the sheet anchor of american republicanism declaration of independence say hold these truth to be self evident that all man be create equal that be endow by creator with certain inalienable right that among these be life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these right government be institute among man derive their just power from the consent of the governed have quote so much at this time merely to show that accord to ancient faith the just power of government be derive from the consent of the govern now the relation of master and slave be pro|tanto a total violation of this principle the master not only govern the slave without consent but govern by a set of rule altogether different from those which prescribe for allow all the govern an equal voice in the government and that and that only be self government let not be say be contend for the establishment of political and social equality between the white and black have already say the contrary be not now combat the argument of necessity arise from the fact that the black be already amongst but be combat what be set up as moral argument for allow to be take where have never yet be argue against the extension of a bad thing which where already exist must of necessity manage as best can in support of application of the doctrine of self government senator douglas have seek to bring to aid the opinion and example of revolutionary father be glad have do this love the sentiment of those old time man and shall be most happy to abide by opinion show that when be in contemplation for the colony to break off from great|britain and set up a new government for several of the state instruct delegate to go for the measure provided each state should be allowed to regulate its domestic concern in its own way do not quote but this in substance this be right see nothing objectionable in also think probable that have some reference to the existence of slavery amongst will not deny that have but have in any reference to the carrying of slavery into new country that be the question and will let the father answer this same generation of man and mostly the same individual of the generation who declare this principle who declare independence who fight the war of the revolution through who afterwards make the constitution under which still live these same man pass the ordinance of declare that slavery should never go to the north west territory have no doubt judge douglas think be very inconsistent in this be a question of discrimination between and but there be not an inch of ground leave for claiming that opinion example authority be on side in this controversy again be not nebraska while a territory a part of do not own the country and if surrender the control of do not surrender the right of self government be part of if say shall not control because be only part the same be true of every other part and when all the part be go what have become of the whole what be then leave of what use for the general government when there be nothing leave for govern but say this question should be leave to the people of nebraska because be more particularly interested if this be the rule must leave to each individual to say for whether will have slave what well moral right have citizen of nebraska to say that the second shall not hold slave than the people of the|thirty state have to say that slavery shall not go into the second state at all but if be a sacred right for the people of nebraska to take and hold slave there be equally sacred right to buy where can buy cheap and that undoubtedly will be on the coast of africa provide will consent to not hang for go there to buy must remove this restriction too from the sacred right of self government be aware say that take slave from the|states|of|nebraska do not make slave of freeman but the african slave trader can say just as much do not catch free negro and bring here find already slave in the hand of black captor and honestly buy at the rate of about a red cotton handkerchief a head this be very cheap and be a great abridgement of the sacred right of self government to hang man for engage in this profitable trade another important objection to this application of the right of self government be that enable the first few to deprive the succeed many of a free exercise of the right of self government the first few may get slavery in and the subsequent many can not easily get out how common be the remark now in the slave states---“if be only clear of slave how much well would be for be actually deprive of the privilege of govern as would by the action of a very few in the beginning the same thing be true of the whole nation at the time constitution be form whether slavery shall go into nebraska or other new territory be not a matter of exclusive concern to the people who may go there the whole nation be interested that the good use shall be make of these territory want for the home of free white people this can not be to any considerable extent if slavery shall be plant within slave|state be place for poor white people to remove from not to remove to new free states be the place for poor people to go to and better condition for this use the nation need these territory still further there be constitutional relation between the slave and free states which be degrade to the latter be under legal obligation to catch and return runaway slave to a sort of dirty disagreeable job which believe as a general rule the slave holder will not perform for another then again in the control of the government the management of the partnership affair have greatly the advantage of by the constitution each state have senator each have a number of representatives in proportion to the number of people and each have a number of presidential elector equal to the whole number of senators|and|representative together but in ascertain the number of the people for this purpose slave be count as be equal to white the slave do not vote be only count and so use as to swell the influence of the white people 's vote the practical effect of this be more aptly show by a comparison of the|states|of|south|carolina and maine south|carolina have representative and so have maine south|carolina have presidential elector and so have maine this be precise equality so far and of course be equal in senators each have thus in the control of the government the states be equal precisely but how be in the number of white people maine have south|carolina have maine have twice as many as south|carolina and over thus each white man in south|carolina be more than the double of any man in maine this be all because south|carolina besides free people have slave the|south|carolinian have precisely the same advantage over the white man in every other free state as well as in maine be more than the double of any of in this crowd the same advantage but not to the same extent be hold by all the citizen of the slave states over those of the free and be an absolute truth without an exception that there be no voter in any slave state but who have more legal power in the government than any voter in any free state there be no instance of exact equality and the disadvantage be against the whole chapter through this principle in the aggregate give the slave states in the present congress additional representative be more than the whole majority by which pass the nebraska bill now all this be manifestly unfair yet do not mention to complain of in so far as be already settle be in the constitution and do not for that cause or any other cause propose to destroy or alter or disregard the constitution stand to fairly fully and firmly but when be tell must leave altogether to other people to say whether new partner be to be breed up and bring into the firm on the same degrading term against respectfully demur insist that whether shall be a whole man or only the half of in comparison with other be a question in which be somewhat concerned and one which no other man can have a sacred right of decide for if be wrong in this if really be a sacred right of self government in the man who shall go to nebraska to decide whether will be the equal of or the double of then after shall have exercise that right and thereby shall have reduce to a still small fraction of a man than already be should like for some gentleman deeply skilled in the mystery of sacred right to provide with a microscope and peep about and find out if can what have become of sacred right will surely be too small for detection with the naked eye finally insist that if there be any thing which be the duty of the whole people to never entrust to any hand but own that thing be the preservation and perpetuity of own liberty and institution and if shall think as do that the extension of slavery endanger more than any or all other cause how recreant to if submit the question and with the fate of country to a mere hand full of man bend only on temporary self interest if this question of slavery extension be an insignificant have no power to do harm may be shuffle aside in this way but be as be the great behemoth of danger shall the strong gripe of the nation be loosen upon to entrust to the hand of such feeble keeper have do with this mighty argument of self government go sacred thing go in peace but nebraska be urge as a great union save measure well too go for save the union much as hate slavery would consent to the extension of rather than see the union dissolve just as would consent to any great evil to avoid a greater one but when go to union saving must believe at least that the mean employ have some adaptation to the end to mind nebraska have no such adaptation “ hath no relish of salvation in be an aggravation rather of the only thing which ever endanger the union when come upon all be peace and quiet the nation be look to the forming of new bond of union and a long course of peace and prosperity seem to lie before in the whole range of possibility there scarcely appear to to have be any thing out of which the slavery agitation could have be revive except the very project of repeal the missouri compromise every inch of territory own already have a definite settlement of the slavery question and by which all party be pledge to abide indeed there be no uninhabited country on the continent which could acquire if except some extreme northern region which be wholly out of the question in this state of case the genius of discord could scarcely have invent a way of again get by the ear but by turn back and destroy the peace measure of the past the council of that genius seem to have prevail the missouri compromise be repeal and here be in the midst of a new slavery agitation such think as have never see before who be responsible for this be those who resist the measure or those who causelessly bring forward and press through have reason to know and in fact know must and would be so resist could not but be expect by author that would be look upon as a measure for the extension of slavery aggravate by a gross breach of faith argue as will and long as will this be the naked front and aspect of the measure and in this aspect could not but produce agitation slavery be found in the selfishness of man 's nature opposition to be love of justice these principle be an eternal antagonism and when bring into collision so fiercely as slavery extension bring shock and throe and convulsion must ceaselessly follow repeal the missouri compromise repeal all compromise repeal the declaration of independence repeal all past history still can not repeal human nature still will be the abundance of man 's heart that slavery extension be wrong and out of the abundance of heart mouth will continue to speak the structure too of the nebraska bill be very peculiar the people be to decide the question of slavery for but when be to decide or how be to decide or whether when the question be once decide be to remain so or be to be subject to an indefinite succession of new trial the law do not say be to be decide by the first dozen settler who arrive there or be to await the arrival of a|hundred be to be decide by a vote of the people or a vote of the legislature or indeed by a vote of any sort to these question the law give no answer there be a mystery about this for when a member propose to give the legislature express authority to exclude slavery be hoot down by the friend of the bill this fact be worth remember some yankee in the east be send emigrant to nebraska to exclude slavery from and so far as can judge expect the question to be decide by voting in some way or other but the missourians be awake too be within a stone 's throw of the contest ground hold meeting and pass resolution in which not the slight allusion to voting be make resolve that slavery already exist in the territory that more shall go there that remain in missouri will protect and that abolitionist shall be hang or drive away through all this bowie knife and shooter be see plainly enough but never a glimpse of the ballot box and really what be to be the result of this each party within have numerous and determined backer without be not probable that the contest will come to blow and bloodshed could there be a more apt invention to bring about collision and violence on the slavery question than this nebraska project be do not charge or believe that such be intend by congress but if have literally form a ring and place champion within to fight out the controversy the fight could be no more likely to come off than be and if this fight should begin be likely to take a very peaceful union save turn will not the first drop of blood so shed be the real knell of the union the missouri compromise ought to be restore for the sake of the union ought to be restore ought to elect a|house|of|representative which will vote restoration if by any mean omit to do this what follow slavery may or may not be establish in nebraska but whether be or not shall have repudiate discard from the council of the nation the spirit of compromise for who after this will ever trust in a national compromise the spirit of mutual concession that spirit which first give the constitution and which have thrice save the union shall have strangle and cast from forever and what shall have in lieu of the south flush with triumph and tempt to excess the north betray as believe brood on wrong and burn for revenge side will provoke the other resent the one will taunt the other defy agree the other retaliate already a few in the north defy all constitutional restraint resist the execution of the fugitive slave law and even menace the institution of slavery in the state where exist already a few in the south claim the constitutional right to take to and hold slave in the free state demand the revival of the slave trade and demand a treaty with great|britain by which fugitive slave may be reclaim from canada as yet be but few on either side be a grave question for the lover of the union whether the final destruction of the missouri compromise and with the spirit of all compromise will or will not embolden and embitter each of these and fatally increase the number of both but restore the compromise and what then thereby restore the national faith the national confidence the national feeling of brotherhood thereby reinstate the spirit of concession and compromise that spirit which have never fail in past peril and which may be safely trust for all the future the south ought to join in do this the peace of the nation be as dear to as to in memory of the past and hope of the future share as largely as would be on part a great act great in spirit and great in effect would be worth to the nation a|hundred|years ' purchase of peace and prosperity and what of sacrifice would make only surrender to what give for a consideration long long ago what have not now ask for struggle or care for what have be thrust upon not less to own astonishment than to but be say can not restore that though elect every member of the low house the senate be still against be quite true that of the senators who pass the nebraska bill a majority of the whole senate will retain seat in spite of the election of this and the|next|year but if at these election several constituency shall clearly express will against nebraska will these senator disregard will will neither obey nor make room for those who will but even if fail to technically restore the compromise be still a great point to carry a popular vote in favor of the restoration the moral weight of such a vote can not be estimate too highly the author of nebraska be not at all satisfied with the destruction of the compromise an endorsement of this principle proclaim to be the great object with nebraska alone be a small matter to establish a principle for future use be what particularly desire that future use be to be the planting of slavery wherever in the wide world local and unorganized opposition can not prevent now if wish to give this endorsement if wish to establish this principle do so shall regret but be right on the contrary if be oppose to the principle intend to give no such endorsement let no wheedling no sophistry divert from throw a direct vote against some man mostly whig who condemn the repeal of the missouri compromise nevertheless hesitate to go for restoration lest be throw in company with the abolitionist will allow as an old whig to tell good humoredly that think this be very silly stand with anybody that stand right stand with while be right and part with when go wrong stand with the abolitionist in restore the missouri compromise and stand against when attempt to repeal the fugitive slave law in the latter case stand with the southern disunionist what of that be still right in both case be right in both case oppose the dangerous extreme in both stand on middle ground and hold the ship level and steady in both be national and nothing less than national this be good old whig ground to desert such ground because of any company be to be less than a whig less than a man less than an american particularly object to the new position which the avowed principle of this nebraska law give to slavery in the body politic object to because assume that there can be moral right in the enslaving of man by another object to as a dangerous dalliance for a few people a sad evidence that feel prosperity forget right that liberty as a principle have cease to revere object to because the father of the republic eschew and reject the argument of “ necessity be the only argument ever admit in favor of slavery and so far and so far only as carry do ever go find the institution exist among which could not help and cast blame upon the british king for have permit introduction before the constitution prohibit introduction into the north western territory the only country own then free from at the framing and adoption of the constitution forbore to so much as mention the word slave or slavery in the whole instrument in the provision for the recovery of fugitive the slave be speak of as a person hold to service or labor in that prohibit the abolition of the african slave trade for twenty|years that trade be speak of as the migration or importation of such person as any of the state now exist shall think proper to admit & c. these be the only provision allude to slavery thus the thing be hide away in the constitution just as an afflicted man hide away a wen or a cancer which dare not cut out at once lest blee to death with the promise nevertheless that the cutting may begin at the end of a give time less than this father could not do and now would not do necessity drive so far and farther would not go but this be not all the early congress under the constitution take the same view of slavery hedge and hem in to the narrow limit of necessity in prohibit an out go slave trade that is the taking of slave from the|united|state to sell in prohibit the bringing of slave from africa into the mississippi territory this territory then comprise what be now of mississippi and alabama this be ten|years before have the authority to do the same thing as to the state exist at the adoption of the constitution in prohibit american citizen from trading in slave between foreign country as for instance from africa to brazil in pass a law in aid of or state law in restraint of the internal slave trade in in apparent hot haste pass the law in advance to take effect the|first|day|of|1808 the constitution would permit prohibit the african slave trade by heavy pecuniary and corporal penalty in find these provision ineffectual declare the trade piracy and annex to the extreme penalty of death while all this be pass in the general government or of the original slave states have adopt system of gradual emancipation and by which the institution be rapidly become extinct within these limit thus see the plain unmistakable spirit of that age towards slavery be hostility to the principle and toleration only by necessity but now be to be transform into a sacred right nebraska bring forth place on the high road to extension and perpetuity and with a pat on back say to “ go and god speed henceforth be to be the chief jewel of the nation the very figure head of the ship of state little by little but steadily as man 's march to the grave have be give up the old for the new faith near eighty|years|ago begin by declare that all man be create equal but now from that begin have run down to the other declaration that for some man to enslave others be a sacred right of self government these principle can not stand together be as opposite as god and mammon and whoever hold to the one must despise the other when pettit in connection with support of the nebraska bill call the|declaration|of|independence “ a self evident lie only do what consistency and candor require all other nebraska man to do of the odd nebraska senators who sit present and hear no one rebuke nor be apprize that any nebraska newspaper or any nebraska orator in the whole nation have ever yet rebuke if this have be say among marion 's man southerner though be what would have become of the man who say if this have be say to the man who capture andre the man who say would probably have be hang sooner than andre be if have be say in old independence|hall the very door keeper would have throttle the man and thrust into the street let no one be deceive the spirit of and the spirit of nebraska be utter antagonism and the former be be rapidly displace by the latter fellow countryman americans south as well as north shall make no effort to arrest this already the liberal party throughout the world express the apprehension “ that the retrograde institution in america be undermine the principle of progress and fatally violate the noble political system the world ever see this be not the taunt of enemy but the warning of friend be quite safe to disregard to despise be there no danger to liberty in discard the early practice and first precept of ancient faith in greedy chase to make profit of the negro let beware lest “ cancel and tear to piece even the white man 's charter of freedom republican robe be soil and trail in the dust let repurify let turn and wash white in the spirit if not the blood of the revolution let turn slavery from claim of moral right back upon exist legal right and argument of “ necessity let return to the position father give and there let rest in peace let re - adopt the|declaration|of|independence and with the practice and policy which harmonize with let north and south let all americans let all lover of liberty everywhere join in the great and good work if do this shall not only have save the union but shall have so save as to make and to keep forever worthy of the saving shall have so save that the succeed million of free happy people the world over shall rise up and call bless to the late generation at springfield where have speak substantially as have here judge douglas reply to and as be to reply to here shall attempt to anticipate by notice some of the point make there commence by state have assume all the way through that the principle of the nebraska bill would have the effect of extend slavery deny that this be intended or that this effect would follow will not re - open the argument upon this point that such be the intention the world believe at the start and will continue to believe this be the countenance of the thing and both friend and enemy instantly recognize as such that countenance can not now be change by argument can as easily argue the color out of the negro ' skin like the bloody hand may wash and wash the red witness of guilt still stick and stare horribly at next say congressional intervention never prevent slavery any where that do not prevent in the north west territory now in illinois that in fact illinois come into the union as a slave state that the principle of the nebraska bill expel from illinois from several old states from every where now this be mere quibble all the way through if the ordinance of do not keep slavery out of the north west territory how happen that the north west shore of the ohio river be entirely free from while the south east shore less than a mile distant along nearly the whole length of the river be entirely cover with if that ordinance do not keep out of illinois what be that make the difference between illinois and missouri lie side by side the mississippi river only divide while early settlement be within the same latitude between|1810|and|1820 the number of slave in missouri increased while in illinois in the same ten|year decrease this appear by the census return during nearly all of that ten|year both be territory not states during this time the ordinance forbid slavery to go into illinois and nothing forbid to go into missouri do go into missouri and do not go into illinois that be the fact can any doubt as to the reason of but say illinois come into the union as a slave state silence perhaps would be the good answer to this flat contradiction of the know history of the country what be the fact upon which this bold assertion be base when first acquire the country as far back as there be some slave within hold by the french inhabitant at kaskaskia the territorial legislation admit a few negro from the slave states as indenture servant one|year after the adoption of the first state constitution the whole number of be what do think just the aggregate free population be to upon this state of fact the people frame constitution prohibit the further introduction of slavery with a sort of guaranty to the owner of the few indentured servant give freedom to child to be bear thereafter and make no mention whatever of any suppose slave for life out of this small matter the judge manufacture argument that illinois come into the union as a slave state let the fact be the answer to the argument the principle of the nebraska bill say expel slavery from illinois the principle of that bill first plant here that is first come because there be no law to prevent first come before own the country and find here and have the ordinance of to prevent increasing people struggle along and finally get rid of as best could but the principle of the nebraska bill abolish slavery in several of the old states well be true that several of the old states in the|last|quarter|of|the|last|century do adopt system of gradual emancipation by which the institution have finally become extinct within limit but may or may not be true that the principle of the nebraska bill be the cause that lead to the adoption of these measure be now more|than|fifty|year since the last of these states adopt system of emancipation if nebraska bill be the real author of these benevolent work be rather deplorable that have for so long a time cease work all together be there not some reason to suspect that be the principle of the revolution and not the principle of nebraska bill that lead to emancipation in these old state leave to the people of those old emancipate states and be quite sure will decide that neither that nor any other good thing ever do or ever will come of nebraska bill in the course of main argument judge douglas interrupt to say that the principle the nebraska bill be very old that originate when god make man and place good and evil before allow to choose for be responsible for the choice should make at the time think this be merely playful and answer accordingly but in reply to renew as a serious argument in seriousness then the fact of this proposition be not true as state god do not place good and evil before man tell to make choice on the contrary do tell there be tree of the fruit of which should not eat upon pain of certain death should scarcely wish so strong a prohibition against slavery in nebraska but this argument strike as not a little remarkable in another particular in strong resemblance to the old argument for the “ divine right of king by the latter the king be to do just as please with white subject be responsible to god alone by the former the white man be to do just as please with black slave be responsible to god alone the thing be precisely alike and be but natural that should find similar argument to sustain have argue that the application of the principle of self government as contend for would require the revival of the african slave trade that no argument could be make in favor of a man 's right to take slave to nebraska which could not be equally well make in favor of right to bring from the coast of africa the judge reply that the constitution require the suppression of the foreign slave trade but do not require the prohibition of slavery in the territory that be a mistake in point of fact the constitution do not require the action of congress in either case and do authorize in both and so there be still no difference between the case in regard to what have say the advantage the slave state have over the free in the matter of representation the judge reply that in the free states count free negro as white people while in the slave states count slave as white only and that the advantage at last be on the side of the free states now in the slave states count free negro just as do and so happen that besides slave have as many free negro as have and three|thousand over thus free negro more than balance our and advantage over in consequence of slave still remain as state in reply to argument that the compromise measure of be a system of equivalent and that the provision of no one of could fairly be carry to other subject without correspond equivalent be carry with the judge deny out right that these measure have any connection with or dependence upon each other this be mere desperation if have no connection why be always speak of in connection why have so spoken of a time why have constantly call a series of measure why do everybody call a compromise why be california keep out of the union six|or|seven|months if be not because of connection with the other measure webster 's lead definition of the verb “ to compromise be to adjust and settle a difference by mutual agreement with concession of claim by the party this convey precisely the popular understanding of the word compromise know before the judge tell that these measure pass separately and in distinct bill and that no of be pass by the vote of precisely the same member but also know and so do know that no one of could have pass both branch of congress but for the understanding that the other be to pass also upon this understanding each get vote which could have get in no other way be this fact that give to the measure true character and be the universal knowledge of this fact that have give the name of compromise so expressive of that true character have ask “ if in carry the provision of the utah and new|mexico law to nebraska could clear away other objection how can leave nebraska “ perfectly free to introduce slavery before form a constitution during territorial the utah and new|mexico law only authorize when form constitution and be admit into the union to this judge douglas answer that the utah and new|mexico law also authorize before and to prove this read from of law as follow that the legislative power of say territory shall extend to all rightful subject of legislation consistent with the constitution of the|united|state and the provision of this act now be perceive from the reading of this that there be nothing express upon the subject but that the authority be seek to be imply merely for the general provision of “ all rightful subject of legislation in reply to this insist as a legal rule of construction as well as the plain popular view of the matter that the express provision for utah and new|mexico come in with slavery if choose when shall form constitution be an exclusion of all imply authority on the same subject that congress have the subject distinctly in mind when make the express provision therein express whole meaning on that subject the judge rather insinuate that have find convenient to forget the washington territorial law pass in this be a division of oregon organize the northern part as the territory of washington assert that by this act the ordinance of theretofore exist in oregon be repeal that nearly all the member of congress vote for begin in the h.r. with of massachusetts and end with richard|yates of illinois and that could not understand how those who now oppose the nebraska bill so vote then unless be because be then too soon after both the great political party have ratify the compromise of and the ratification therefore too fresh to be then repudiate now have see the washington act before and have carefully examine since and aver that there be no repeal of the ordinance of or of any prohibition of slavery in in express term there be absolutely nothing in the whole law upon the subject in fact nothing to lead a reader to think of the subject to judgment be equally free from every thing from which such repeal can be legally imply but however this may be be man now to be entrap by a legal implication extract from covert language introduce perhaps for the very purpose of entrap sincerely wish every man could read this law quite through carefully watch every sentence and every line for a repeal of the ordinance of or any thing equivalent to another point on the washington act if be intend to be model after the utah and new|mexico act as judge douglas insist why be not insert in as in that washington be to come in with or without slavery as may choose at the adoption of constitution have no such provision in and defy the ingenuity of man to give a reason for the omission other than that be not intend to follow the utah and new|mexico law in regard to the question of slavery the washington act not only differ vitally from the utah and new|mexico act but the nebraska act differ vitally from both by the latter act the people be leave “ perfectly free to regulate own domestic concern & c. but in all the former all law be to be submit to congress and if disapprove be to be null the washington act go even further absolutely prohibit the territorial legislation by very strong and guarded language from establish bank or borrow money on the faith of the territory be this the sacred right of self government hear vaunt so much no sir the nebraska bill find no model in the act of or the washington act find no model in any law from adam till today as phillips say of napoleon the nebraska act be grand gloomy and peculiar wrap in the solitude of own originality without a model and without a shadow upon the earth in the course of reply senator douglas remark in substance that have always consider this government be make for the white people and not for the negro why in point of mere fact think so too but in this remark of the judge there be a significance which think be the key to the great mistake if there be any such mistake which have make in this nebraska measure show that the judge have no very vivid impression that the negro be a human and consequently have no idea that there can be any moral question in legislate about in view the question of whether a new country shall be slave or free be a matter of as utter indifference as be whether neighbor shall plant farm with tobacco or stock with horned cattle now whether this view be right or wrong be very certain that the great mass of mankind take a totally different view consider slavery a great moral wrong and feeling against be not evanescent but eternal lie at the very foundation of sense of justice and can not be trifle with be a great and durable element of popular action and think no statesman can safely disregard senator also object that those who oppose in this measure do not entirely agree with another remind that in firm adherence to the constitutional right of the slave states differ widely from other who be co - operate with in oppose the nebraska bill and say be not quite fair to oppose in this variety of way should remember that take by surprise astound by this measure be thunderstruck and stunned and reel and fall in utter confusion but rise each fighting grasp whatever could first reach a scythe a pitchfork a chopping axe or a butcher 's cleaver strike in the direction of the sound and be rapidly close in upon must not think to divert from purpose by show that drill dress and weapon be not entirely perfect and uniform when the storm shall be past shall find still americans no less devoted to the continue union and prosperity of the country than heretofore finally the judge invoke against the memory of clay and of webster be great man and man of great deed but where have assail for what be that life long enemy shall now make profit by assume to defend against life long friend go against the repeal of the missouri compromise do ever go for go for the compromise of do ever go against be greatly devoted to the union to the small measure of ability be ever less so clay and webster be dead before this question arise by what authority shall senator say would espouse side of if alive mr. clay be the lead spirit in make the missouri compromise be very credible that if now alive would take the lead in the breaking of the truth be that some support from whig be now a necessity with the judge and for thus be that the name of clay|and|webster be now invoke old friend have desert in such number as to leave too few to live by come to own and own receive not and lo turn unto the gentiles a word now as to the judge 's desperate assumption that the compromise of have no connection with another that illinois come into the union as a slave state and some other similar one this be no other than a bold denial of the history of the country if do not know that the compromises of be dependent on each other if do not know that illinois come into the union as a free state do not know any thing if do not know these thing do not know that ever have a revolutionary war or such a chief as washington to deny these thing be to deny national axiom or dogma at least and put an end to all argument if a man will stand up and assert and repeat and re - assert that and do not make know nothing in the power of argument that can stop think can answer the judge so long as stick to the premise but when fly from can not work an argument into the consistency of a maternal gag and actually close mouth with in such a case can only commend to the seventy|thousand answer just in from pennsylvania ohio and indiana the repeal of the missouri compromise and the propriety of restoration constitute the subject of what be about to say as desire to present own connected view of this subject remark will not be specifically an answer to judge douglas yet as proceed the main point have present will arise and will receive such respectful attention as may be able to give wish further to say that do not propose to question the patriotism or to assail the motif of any man or class of man but rather to strictly confine to the naked merit of the question also wish to be no less than national in all the position may take and whenever take ground which other have think or may think narrow sectional and dangerous to the union hope to give a reason which will appear sufficient at least to some why think differently and as this subject be no other than part and parcel of the large general question of domestic slavery wish to make and to keep the distinction between the existing institution and the extension of so broad and so clear that no honest man can misunderstand and no dishonest one successfully misrepresent in order to a clear understanding of what the|missouri|compromise be a short history of the precede kindre subject will perhaps be proper when establish independence do not own or claim the country to which this compromise apply indeed strictly speak the confederacy then own no country at all the states respectively own the country within limit and some of own territory beyond strict state limit virginia thus own the north western territory the country out of which the principal part of ohio all indiana all illinois all michigan and all wisconsin have since be form also own perhaps within then limit what have since be form into the|state|of|kentucky north|carolina thus own what be now the state of tennessee and south|carolina and georgia in separate part own what be now mississippi and alabama connecticut think own the little remaining part of ohio — be the same where now send giddings to congress and beat all creation at make cheese these territory together with the states constitute all the country over which the confederacy then claim any sort of jurisdiction be then live under the|articles|of|confederation which be supercede by the constitution several|years afterwards the question of cede these territory to the general government be set on foot mr. jefferson the author of the|declaration|of|independence and otherwise a chief actor in the revolution then a delegate in congress afterwards twice president who be be and perhaps will continue to be the most distinguished politician of history a virginian by birth and continue residence and withal a slave holder conceive the idea of take that occasion to prevent slavery ever go into the north western territory prevail on the|virginia|legislature to adopt view and to cede the territory make the prohibition of slavery therein a condition of the deed congress accept the cession with the condition and in the first ordinance which the act of congress be then call for the government of the territory provide that slavery should never be permit therein this be the famed ordinance of so often speak of thenceforward for one|year and until in the last scrap of this territory come into the union as the|state|of|wisconsin all party act in quiet obedience to this ordinance be now what jefferson foresaw and intend the happy home of teem million of free white prosperous people and no slave amongst thus with the author of the declaration of independence the policy of prohibit slavery in new territory originate thus away back of the constitution in the pure fresh free breath of the revolution the|state|of|virginia and the national congress put that policy in practice thus through sixty|odd of the good year of the republic do that policy steadily work to great and beneficent end and thus in those state and five|million of free enterprise people have before the rich fruit of this policy but now new light break upon now congress declare this ought never to have be and the like of must never be again the sacred right of self government be grossly violate by even find some man who draw first breath and every other breath of life under this very restriction now live in dread of absolute suffocation if should be restrict in the sacred right of take slave to nebraska that perfect liberty sigh for — the liberty of make slave of other people jefferson never think of own father never think of never think of a|year|ago how fortunate for do not sooner become sensible of great misery oh how difficult be to treat with respect such assault upon all have ever really hold sacred but to return to history in purchase what be then call louisiana of france include the now state of louisiana arkansas missouri and iowa also the territory of minnesota and the present bone of contention kansas and nebraska slavery already exist among the french at new|orlean and to some extent at st.|louis in louisiana come into the union as a slave state without controversy in or missouri show sign of a wish to come in with slavery this be resist by northern member of congress and thus begin the first great slavery agitation in the nation this controversy last several|months and become very angry and exciting the|house|of|representative voting steadily for the prohibition of slavery in missouri and the senate voting as steadily against threat of break up the union be freely make and the ablest public man of the|day become seriously alarm at length a compromise be make in which like all compromise both side yield something be a law pass on the|6th|day|of|march,|1820 provide that missouri may come into the union with slavery but that in all the remain part of the territory purchase of france which lie north of and north latitude slavery should never be permit this provision of law be the|missouri|compromise in exclude slavery north of the line the same language be employ as in the|ordinance|of|'87 directly apply to iowa minnesota and to the present bone of contention kansas and nebraska whether there should or should not be slavery south of that line nothing be say in the law but arkansas constitute the principal remain part south of the line and have since be admit as a slave state without serious controversy more recently iowa north of the line come in as a free state without controversy still later minnesota north of the line have a territorial organization without controversy texas principally south of the line and west|of|arkansas though originally within the purchase from france have in be trade off to spain in treaty for the acquisition of florida have thus become a part of mexico mexico revolutionize and become independent of spain american citizen begin settle rapidly with slave in the southern part of texas soon revolutionize against mexico and establish an independent government of own adopt a constitution with slavery strongly resemble the constitution of slave state by still another rapid move texas claim a boundary much further west than when part with in be bring back to the|united|state and admit into the union as a slave state there then be little or no settlement in the northern part of texas a considerable portion of which lie north of the missouri line and in the resolution admit into the union the missouri restriction be expressly extend westward across territory this be in only|nine|years|ago thus originate the|missouri|compromise and thus have be respect down to and even four|years|later in distinguished senator in a public address hold the following language in relation to the missouri compromise have be in practical operation for about|a|quarter|of|a|century and have receive the sanction and approbation of man of all party in every section of the union have allay all sectional jealousy and irritation grow out of this vexed question and harmonize and tranquilize the whole country have give to henry|clay as prominent champion the proud sobriquet of the|“great|pacificator and by that title and for that service political friend have repeatedly appeal to the people to rally under standard as a presidential candidate as the man who have exhibit the patriotism and the power to suppress an unholy and treasonable agitation and preserve the union be not aware that any man or any party from any section of the union have ever urge as an objection to mr. clay that be the great champion of the missouri compromise on the contrary the effort be make by the opponent of mr. clay to prove that be not entitle to the exclusive merit of that great patriotic measure and that the honor be equally due to other as well as to for secure adoption that have origin in the heart of all patriotic man who desire to preserve and perpetuate the blessing of glorious union an origin akin that of the constitution of the|united|state conceive in the same spirit of fraternal affection and calculate to remove forever the only danger which seem to threaten at some distant day to sever the social bond of union all the evidence of public opinion at that|day seem to indicate that this compromise have be canonize in the heart of the american people as a sacred thing which no ruthless hand would ever be reckless enough to disturb do not read this extract to involve judge douglas in an inconsistency if afterwards think have be wrong be right for to change bring this forward merely to show the high estimate place on the missouri compromise by all party up to so late as the|year|1849 but go back a little in point of time war with mexico break out in when congress be about adjourn that session president polk ask to place two|millions|of|dollar under control to be use by in the recess if find practicable and expedient in negociate a treaty of peace with mexico and acquire some part of territory a bill be duly get up for the purpose and be progress swimmingly in the|house|of|representatives when a member by the name of david|wilmot a democrat from pennsylvania move as an amendment “ provide that in any territory thus acquire there shall never be slavery this be the origin of the far famed “ wilmot|proviso create a great flutter but stick like wax be vote into the bill and the bill pass with through the house the senate however adjourn without final action on and so both appropriation and proviso be lose for the time the war continue and at the next session the president renew request for the appropriation enlarge the amount think to three|million again come the proviso and defeat the measure congress adjourn again and the war go on in dec.,|1847 the new congress assemble be in the low house that term the “ wilmot proviso or the principle of be constantly come up in some shape or other and think may venture to say vote for at|least|forty time during the short term be there the senate however hold in check and never become law in the|spring|of|1848 a treaty of peace be make with mexico by which obtain that portion of country which now constitute the territory of new|mexico and utah and the now state of california by this treaty be defeat as so far as be intend to be a condition of the acquisition of territory friend however be still determined to find some way to restrain slavery from get into the new country this new acquisition lie directly west of old purchase from france and extend west to the pacific ocean and be so situate that if the missouri line should be extend straight west the new country would be divide by such extended line leave some north and some south of on judge douglas ' motion a bill or provision of a bill pass the senate to so extend the missouri line the proviso man in the house include vote down because by implication give up the southern part to slavery while be bent on have all free in the|fall|of|1848 the gold mine be discover in california this attract people to with unprecedented rapidity so that on or soon after the meeting of the new congress in dec.,|1849 already have a population of nearly|a|hundred|thousand have call a convention form a state constitution exclude slavery and be knock for admission into the union the proviso man of course be for let in but the senate always true to the other side would not consent to admission and there california stand keep out of the union because would not let slavery into border under all the circumstance perhaps this be not wrong there be other point of dispute connect with the general question of slavery which equally need adjustment the south clamor for a more efficient fugitive slave law the north clamor for the abolition of a peculiar specie of slave trade in in connection with which in view from the window of the capitol a sort of negro livery stable where drove of negro be collect temporarily keep and finally take to southern market precisely like drove of horse have be openly maintain for fifty|years utah and new|mexico need territorial government and whether slavery should or should not be prohibit within be another question the indefinite western boundary of texas be to be settle be receive a slave state and consequently the farther west the slavery man could push boundary the more slave country secure and the farther east the slavery opponent could thrust the boundary back the less slave ground be secure thus this be just as clearly a slavery question as any of the other these point all need adjustment and be all hold up perhaps wisely to make help to adjust another the union now as in be think to be in danger and devotion to the union rightfully incline man to yield somewhat in point where nothing else could have so incline a compromise be finally effect the south get new fugitive slave law and the north get california the far good part of acquisition from mexico as a free state the south get a provision that new|mexico and utah when admit as states may come in with or without slavery as may then choose and the north get the slave trade abolish in the north get the western boundary of texas thence further back eastward than the south desire but in turn give texas ten|millions|of|dollars with which to pay old debt this be the compromise of precede the presidential election of each of the great political party democrat and whig meet in convention and adopt resolution endorse the compromise of as a finality a final settlement so far as these party could make so of all slavery agitation previous to this in the|illinois|legislature have indorse during this long period of time nebraska have remain substantially an uninhabited country but now emigration to and settlement within begin to take place be about|one|third as large as the present united|stat and importance so long overlook begin to come into view the restriction of slavery by the missouri compromise directly apply to in fact be first make and have since be maintain expressly for in a bill to give a territorial government pass the|house|of|representatives and in the hand of judge douglas fail of pass the senate only for want of time this bill contain no repeal of the missouri compromise indeed when be assail because do not contain such repeal judge douglas defend in exist form on january|4th,|1854 judge douglas introduce a new bill to give nebraska territorial government accompany this bill with a report in which last expressly recommend that the missouri compromise shall neither be affirm nor repeal before long the bill be so modify as to make territory instead of call the southern kansas also about|a|month after the introduction of the bill on the judge 's own motion be so amend as to declare the missouri compromise inoperative and void and substantially that the people who go and settle there may establish slavery or exclude as may see fit in this shape the bill pass both branch of congress and become a law this be the repeal of the|missouri|compromise the forego history may not be precisely accurate in every particular but be sure be sufficiently so for all the us shall attempt to make of and in have before the chief material enable to correctly judge whether the repeal of the|missouri|compromise be right or wrong think and shall try to show that be wrong wrong in direct effect let slavery into kansas and nebraska — and wrong in prospective principle allow to spread to every other part of the wide world where man can be find inclined to take this declare indifference but as must think covert real zeal for the spread of slavery can not but hate hate because of the monstrous injustice of slavery hate because deprive republican example of just influence in the world enable the enemy of free institution with plausibility to taunt as hypocrite cause the real friend of freedom to doubt sincerity and especially because force so many really good man amongst into an open war with the very fundamental principle of civil liberty criticise the|declaration|of|independence and insist that there be no right principle of action but self interest before proceed let say think have no prejudice against the southern people be just what would be in situation if slavery do not now exist amongst would not introduce if do now exist amongst should not instantly give up this believe of the masse north and south doubtless there be individual on both side who would not hold slave under any circumstance and other who would gladly introduce slavery anew if be out of existence know that some southern man do free slave go north and become tip top abolitionist while some northern one go south and become most cruel slave master when southern people tell be no more responsible for the origin of slavery than acknowledge the fact when be say that the institution exist and that be very difficult to get rid of in any satisfactory way can understand and appreciate the saying surely will not blame for not do what should not know how to do if all earthly power be give should not know what to do as to the exist institution first impulse would be to free all the slave and send to liberia,—to own native land but a moment 's reflection would convince that whatever of high hope as think there be there may be in this in the long run sudden execution be impossible if be all land there in a day would all perish in the|next|ten|day and there be not surplus shipping and surplus money enough in the world to carry there in many time ten|day what then free all and keep among as underling be quite certain that this better condition think would not hold in slavery at any rate yet the point be not clear enough for to denounce people upon what next free and make politically and socially equal own feeling will not admit of this and if would well know that those of the great mass of white people will not whether this feeling accord with justice and sound judgment be not the sole question if indeed be any part of a universal feeling whether well or ill found can not be safely disregard can not then make equal do seem to that system of gradual emancipation may be adopt but for tardiness in this will not undertake to judge brother of the south when remind of constitutional right acknowledge not grudgingly but fully and fairly and would give any legislation for the reclaiming of fugitive which should not in stringency be more likely to carry a free man into slavery than ordinary criminal law be to hang an innocent but all this to judgment furnish no more excuse for permit slavery to go into own free territory than would for revive the african slave trade by law the law which forbid the bringing of slave from africa and that which have so long forbid the take to nebraska can hardly be distinguish on any moral principle and the repeal of the former could find quite as plausible excuse as that of the latter the argument by which the repeal of the missouri compromise be seek to be justify be these first that the nebraska country need a territorial government second that in various way the public have repudiate and demand the repeal and therefore should not now complain of and lastly that the repeal establish a principle which be intrinsically right will attempt an answer to each of in turn first then if that country be in need of a territorial organization could not have have as well without as with the repeal iowa and minnesota to both of which the missouri restriction apply have without repeal each in succession territorial organization and even a bill for nebraska be within an ace of pass without the repeal clause and this in the hand of the same man who be now the champion of repeal why no necessity then for the repeal but still later when this very bill be first bring in contain no repeal but say because the public have demand or rather command the repeal the repeal be to accompany the organization whenever that should occur now deny that the public ever demand any such thing — ever repudiate the missouri compromise ever command repeal deny and call for the proof be not contend believe that any such command have ever be give in express term be only say that be do in principle the support of the|wilmot|proviso be the first fact mention to prove that the missouri restriction be repudiate in principle and the second be the refusal to extend the missouri line over the country acquire from mexico these be near enough alike to be treat together the one be to exclude the chance of slavery from the whole new acquisition by the lump and the other be to reject a division of by which one|half be to be give up to those chance now whether this be a repudiation of the missouri line in principle depend upon whether the missouri law contain any principle require the line to be extend over the country acquire from mexico contend do not insist that contain no general principle but that be in every sense specific that term limit to the country purchase from france be undenied and undeniable could have no principle beyond the intention of those who make do not intend to extend the line to country which do not own if intend to extend in the event of acquire additional territory why do not say so be just as easy to say that in all the country west of the mississippi which now own or may hereafter acquire there shall never be slavery as to say what do say and would have say if have mean an intention to extend the law be not only not mention in the law but be not mention in any contemporaneous history both the law and the history of the time be a blank as to any principle of extension and by neither the know rule for construe statute and contract nor by common sense can any such principle be infer another fact show the specific character of the missouri law show that intend no more than express — show that the line be not intend as a universal dividing line between free and slave territory present and prospective north of which slavery could never go be the fact that by that very law missouri come in as a slave state north of the line if that law contain any prospective principle the whole law must be look to in order to ascertain what the principle be and by this rule the south could fairly contend that inasmuch as get slave state north of the line at the inception of the law have the right to have another give north of occasionally — now and then in the indefinite westward extension of the line this demonstrate the absurdity of attempt to deduce a prospective principle from the missouri compromise line when vote for the|wilmot|proviso be vote to keep slavery out of the whole missouri acquisition and little do think be thereby vote to let into nebraska lay several|hundred|miles distant when vote against extend the missouri line little do think be vote to destroy the old line then of near thirty|years stand to argue that thus repudiate the|missouri|compromise be no less absurd than would be to argue that because have so far forborne to acquire cuba have thereby in principle repudiate former acquisition and determine to throw out of the union no less absurd than would be to say that because may have refuse to build an addition to house thereby have decide to destroy the exist house and if catch set fire to house will turn upon and say instructed to do the most conclusive argument however that while vote for the|wilmot|proviso and while vote against the extension of the missouri line never think of disturb the original missouri|compromise be find in the fact that there be then and still be an unorganized tract of fine country nearly as large as the state of missouri lie immediately west of arkansas and south of the missouri compromise line and that never attempt to prohibit slavery as to wish particular attention to this adjoin the original missouri|compromise line by northern boundary and consequently be part of the country into which by implication slavery be permit to go by that compromise there have lie open ever since and there still lie and yet no effort have be make at any time to wrest from the south in all struggle to prohibit slavery within mexican acquisition never so much as lift a finger to prohibit as to this tract be not this entirely conclusive that at all time have hold the|missouri|compromise as a sacred thing even when against as well as when for senator douglas sometimes say the missouri line be in principle only an extension of the line of the ordinance of 87—that be to say an extension of the ohio river think this be weak enough on face will remark however that as a glance at the map will show the missouri line be a long way farther south than the ohio and that if senator in propose extension have stick to the principle of jog southward perhaps may not have be vote down so readily but next be say that the compromise of and the ratification of by both political party in establish a new principle which require the repeal of the|missouri|compromise this again deny deny and demand the proof have already state fully what the compromise of be the particular part of those measure for which the virtual repeal of the missouri compromise be seek to be infer for be admit contain nothing about in express term be the provision in the utah and new|mexico law which permit when seek admission into the|union|as|states to come in with or without slavery as shall then see fit now insist this provision be make for utah and new|mexico and for no other place whatever have no more direct reference to nebraska than have to the territory of the moon but say have reference to nebraska in principle let see the north consent to this provision not because consider right in but because be compensate pay for at the same time get california into the union as a free state this be far the good part of all have struggle for by the|wilmot|proviso also get the area of slavery somewhat narrow in the settlement of the boundary of texas also get the slave trade abolish in for all these desirable object the north could afford to yield something and do yield to the south the utah and new|mexico provision do not mean that the whole north or even a majority yield when the law pass but enough yield when add to the vote of the south to carry the measure now can be pretend that the principle of this arrangement require to permit the same provision to be apply to nebraska without any equivalent at all give another free state press the boundary of texas still further back give another step toward the destruction of slavery in the district and present a similar case but ask not to repeat for nothing what pay for in the first instance if wish the thing again pay again that be the principle of the compromise of if indeed have any principle beyond specific term be the system of equivalent again if congress at that time intend that all future territory should when admit as states come in with or without slavery at own option why do not say so with such an universal provision all know the bill could not have pass do then could — establish a principle contrary to own intention still further if intend to establish the principle that wherever congress have control should be leave to the people to do as think fit with slavery why do not authorize the people of the|district|of|columbia at adoption to abolish slavery within these limit personally know that this have not be leave undone because be unthought of be frequently speak of by member of congress and by citizen of washington six|years|ago and hear no one express a doubt that a system of gradual emancipation with compensation to owner would meet the approbation of a large majority of the white people of the district but without the action of congress could say nothing and congress say no in the measure of congress have the subject of slavery in the district expressly in hand if be then establish the principle of allow the people to do as please with slavery why do not apply the principle to that people again be claim that by the resolutions of the illinois legislature pass in the repeal of the missouri compromise be demand this deny also whatever may be work out by a criticism of the language of those resolution the people have never understand as be any more than an endorsement of the compromise of and a release of senator from vote for the|wilmot|proviso the whole people be live witness that this only be view finally be ask “ if do not mean to apply the utah and new|mexico provision to all future territory what do mean when in endorse the compromise of for can answer this question most easily mean not to ask a repeal or modification of the fugitive slave law mean not to ask for the abolition of slavery in mean not to resist the admission of utah and new|mexico even should ask to come in as slave states mean nothing about additional territory because as understand then have no territory whose character as to slavery be not already settle as to nebraska regard character as be fix by the missouri compromise for thirty|years as unalterably fix as that of own home in illinois as to new acquisition say “ sufficient unto the|day be the evil thereof when make new acquaintance will as heretofore try to manage some how that be answer that be what mean and say and appeal to the people to say each for whether that be not also the universal meaning of the free states and now in turn let ask a few question if by any or all these matter the repeal of the missouri compromise be command why be not the command sooner obeyed why be the repeal omit in the nebraska bill of why be omit in the original bill of why in the accompanying report be such a repeal characterize as a departure from the course pursue in and continued omission recommend be aware judge douglas now argue that the subsequent express repeal be no substantial alteration of the bill this argument seem wonderful to be as if one should argue that white and black be not different admit however that there be a literal change in the bill and that make the change in deference to other senator who would not support the bill without this prove that those other senators think the change a substantial and that the judge think opinion worth defer to own opinion therefore seem not to rest on a very firm basis even in own mind and suppose the world believe and will continue to believe that precisely on the substance of that change this whole agitation have arise conclude then that the public never demand the repeal of the missouri compromise now come to consider whether the repeal with avowed principle be intrinsically right insist that be not take the particular case a controversy have arise between the advocate and opponent of slavery in relation to establishment within the country have purchase of france the southern and then good part of the purchase be already in as a slave state the controversy be settle by also let missouri in as a slave state but with the agreement that within all the remain part of the purchase north of a certain line there should never be slavery as to what be to be do with the remain part south of the line nothing be say but perhaps the fair implication be that should come in with slavery if should so choose the southern part except a portion heretofore mention afterwards do come in with slavery as the state of arkansas all these many year since the northern part have remain a wilderness at length settlement begin in also in due course iowa come in as a free state and minnesota be give a territorial government without remove the slavery restriction finally the sole remain part north of the line kansas and nebraska be to be organize and be propose and carry to blot out the old dividing line of four|year standing and to open the whole of that country to the introduction of slavery now this to mind be manifestly unjust after an angry and dangerous controversy the party make friend by divide the bone of contention the party first appropriate own share beyond all power to be disturb in the possession of and then seize the share of the other party be as if starve man have divide only loaf the one have hastily swallow half and then grab the other half just as be put to mouth let here drop the main argument to notice what consider rather an inferior matter be argue that slavery will not go to kansas and nebraska in any event this be a palliation a lullaby have some hope that will not but let not be too confident as to climate a glance at the map show that there be slave states — delaware maryland virginia kentucky and missouri — and also all north of the missouri compromise line the census return of show that within these there be slave be fourth of all the slave in the nation be not climate then that will keep slavery out of these territory be there any thing in the peculiar nature of the country missouri adjoin these territory by entire western boundary and slavery be already within every of western county have even hear say that there be more slave in proportion to white in the north western county of missouri than within any county of the state slavery press entirely up to the old western boundary of the state and when rather recently a part of that boundary at the north west be move out a little farther west slavery follow on quite up to the new line now when the restriction be remove what be to prevent from go still further climate will not no peculiarity of the country will — nothing in nature will will the disposition of the people prevent those nearest the scene be all in favor of the extension the yankee who be oppose to may be more numerous but in military phrase the battle field be too far from base of operation but be say there now be no law in nebraska on the subject of slavery and that in such case take a slave there operate freedom that be good book law but be not the rule of actual practice wherever slavery be have be first introduce without law the old law find concern be not law introduce but regulate as an already exist thing a white man take slave to nebraska now who will inform the negro that be free who will take before court to test the question of freedom in ignorance of legal emancipation be keep chop splitting and plowing other be bring and move on in the same track at last if ever the time for voting come on the question of slavery the institution already in fact exist in the country and can not well be remove the fact of presence and the difficulty of removal will carry the vote in favor keep out until a vote be take and a vote in favor of can not be get in any population of forty|thousand on earth who have be draw together by the ordinary motif of emigration and settlement to get slave into the country simultaneously with the white in the incipient stage of settlement be the precise stake play for and win in this nebraska measure the question be ask if slave will go in notwithstanding the general principle of law liberate why would not equally go in against positive statute law?—go in even if the missouri restriction be maintain answer because take a much bold man to venture in with property in the latter case than in the former — because the positive congressional enactment be know to and respect by all or nearly all whereas the negative principle that no law be free law be not much know except among lawyer have some experience of this practical difference in spite of the|ordinance|of|'87 a few negro be bring into illinois and hold in a state of quasi slavery not enough however to carry a vote of the people in favor of the institution when come to form a constitution but in the adjoin missouri country where there be no ordinance of no restriction be carry time nay a time as fast and actually make a slave state this be fact — naked fact another lullaby argument be that take slave to new country do not increase number do not make any slave who otherwise would be free there be some truth in this and be glad of but not wholly true the african slave trade be not yet effectually suppress and if make a reasonable deduction for the white people amongst who be foreigner and the descendant of foreigner arrive here since shall find the increase of the black population out run that of the white to an extent unaccountable except by suppose that some of too have be come from africa if this be so the opening of new country to the institution increase the demand for and augment the price of slave and so do in fact make slave of freeman by cause to be bring from africa and sell into bondage but however this may be know the opening of new country to slavery tend to the perpetuation of the institution and so do keep man in slavery who otherwise would be free this result do not feel like favor and be under no legal obligation to suppress feeling in this respect equal justice to the south be say require to consent to the extending of slavery to new country that be to say inasmuch as do not object to take hog to nebraska therefore must not object to take slave now admit this be perfectly logical if there be no difference between hog and negro but while thus require to deny the humanity of the negro wish to ask whether of the south yourself have ever be willing to do as much be kindly provide that of all those who come into the world only a small percentage be natural tyrant that percentage be no large in the slave states than in the free the great majority south as well as north have human sympathy of which can no more div than can of sensibility to physical pain these sympathy in the bosom of the southern people manifest in many way sense of the wrong of slavery and consciousness that after all there be humanity in the negro if deny this let address a few plain question in join the north almost unanimously in declare the african slave trade piracy and in annex to the punishment of death why do do this if do not feel that be wrong why do join in provide that man should be hang for the practice be no more than bring wild negro from africa to sell to such as would buy but never think of hang man for catch and sell wild horse wild buffaloes or wild bear again have amongst a sneak individual of the class of native tyrant know as the slave dealer watch necessity and crawl up to buy slave at a speculating price if can not help sell to but if can help drive from door despise utterly do not recognize as a friend or even as an honest man child must not play with may rollick freely with the little negro but not with the “ slave dealer child if be oblige to deal with try to get through the job without so much as touch be common with to join hand with the man meet but with the slave dealer avoid the ceremony instinctively shrink from the snaky contact if grow rich and retire from business still remember and still keep up the ban of non - intercourse upon and family now why be this do not so treat the man who deal in corn cattle or tobacco and yet again there be in the|united|state and territory include free black at per head be worth over million of dollar how come this vast amount of property to be run about without owner do not see free horse or free cattle run at large how be this all these free black be the descendant of slave or have be slave and would be slave now but for something which have operate on white owner induce at vast pecuniary sacrifice to liberate what be that something be there any mistake in all these case be sense of justice and human sympathy continually tell that the poor negro have some natural right to that those who deny and make mere merchandise of deserve kicking contempt and death and now why will ask to deny the humanity of the slave and estimate only as the equal of the hog why ask to do what will not do why ask to do for nothing what two|hundred|million|of|dollar could not induce to do but great argument in the support of the repeal of the missouri compromise be still to come that argument be the sacred right of self government seem distinguished senator have find great difficulty in get antagonist even in the senate to meet fairly on this argument some poet have say “ fools rush in where angel fear to tread at the hazzard of be think of the fool of this quotation meet that argument — rush in take that bull by the horn trust understand and truly estimate the right of self government faith in the proposition that each man should do precisely as please with all which be exclusively own lie at the foundation of the sense of justice there be in extend the principle to community of man as well as to individual so extend because be politically wise as well as naturally just politically wise in save from broil about matter which do not concern here or at washington would not trouble with the oyster law of virginia or the cranberry law of indiana the doctrine of self government be right — absolutely and eternally right but have no just application as here attempt or perhaps should rather say that whether have such just application depend upon whether a negro be not or be a man if be not a man why in that case who be a man may as a matter of self government do just as please with but if the negro be a man be not to that extent a total destruction of self government to say that too shall not govern when the white man govern that be self government but when govern and also govern another man that be more than self government that be despotism if the negro be a man why then ancient faith teach that all man be create equal and that there can be no moral right in connection with man be make a slave of another judge douglas frequently with bitter irony and sarcasm paraphrase argument by say the white people of nebraska be good enough to govern but be not good enough to govern a few miserable negro well doubt not that the people of nebraska be and will continue to be as good as the average of people elsewhere do not say the contrary what do say be that no man be good enough to govern another man without that other 's consent say this be the lead principle the sheet anchor of american republicanism declaration of independence say hold these truth to be self evident that all man be create equal that be endow by creator with certain inalienable right that among these be life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these right government be institute among man derive their just power from the consent of the governed have quote so much at this time merely to show that accord to ancient faith the just power of government be derive from the consent of the govern now the relation of master and slave be pro|tanto a total violation of this principle the master not only govern the slave without consent but govern by a set of rule altogether different from those which prescribe for allow all the govern an equal voice in the government and that and that only be self government let not be say be contend for the establishment of political and social equality between the white and black have already say the contrary be not now combat the argument of necessity arise from the fact that the black be already amongst but be combat what be set up as moral argument for allow to be take where have never yet be argue against the extension of a bad thing which where already exist must of necessity manage as best can in support of application of the doctrine of self government senator douglas have seek to bring to aid the opinion and example of revolutionary father be glad have do this love the sentiment of those old time man and shall be most happy to abide by opinion show that when be in contemplation for the colony to break off from great|britain and set up a new government for several of the state instruct delegate to go for the measure provided each state should be allowed to regulate its domestic concern in its own way do not quote but this in substance this be right see nothing objectionable in also think probable that have some reference to the existence of slavery amongst will not deny that have but have in any reference to the carrying of slavery into new country that be the question and will let the father answer this same generation of man and mostly the same individual of the generation who declare this principle — who declare independence who fight the war of the revolution through — who afterwards make the constitution under which still live these same man pass the ordinance of declare that slavery should never go to the north west territory have no doubt judge douglas think be very inconsistent in this be a question of discrimination between and but there be not an inch of ground leave for claiming that opinion example authority be on side in this controversy again be not nebraska while a territory a part of do not own the country and if surrender the control of do not surrender the right of self government be part of if say shall not control because be only part the same be true of every other part and when all the part be go what have become of the whole what be then leave of what use for the general government when there be nothing leave for govern but say this question should be leave to the people of nebraska because be more particularly interested if this be the rule must leave to each individual to say for whether will have slave what well moral right have citizen of nebraska to say that the second shall not hold slave than the people of the|thirty state have to say that slavery shall not go into the second state at all but if be a sacred right for the people of nebraska to take and hold slave there be equally sacred right to buy where can buy cheap and that undoubtedly will be on the coast of africa provide will consent to not hang for go there to buy must remove this restriction too from the sacred right of self government be aware say that take slave from the|states|of|nebraska do not make slave of freeman but the african slave trader can say just as much do not catch free negro and bring here find already slave in the hand of black captor and honestly buy at the rate of about a red cotton handkerchief a head this be very cheap and be a great abridgement of the sacred right of self government to hang man for engage in this profitable trade another important objection to this application of the right of self government be that enable the first few to deprive the succeed many of a free exercise of the right of self government the first few may get slavery in and the subsequent many can not easily get out how common be the remark now in the slave be only clear of slave how much well would be for be actually deprive of the privilege of govern as would by the action of a very few in the beginning the same thing be true of the whole nation at the time constitution be form whether slavery shall go into nebraska or other new territory be not a matter of exclusive concern to the people who may go there the whole nation be interested that the good use shall be make of these territory want for the home of free white people this can not be to any considerable extent if slavery shall be plant within slave|state be place for poor white people to remove from not to remove to new free states be the place for poor people to go to and better condition for this use the nation need these territory still further there be constitutional relation between the slave and free states which be degrade to the latter be under legal obligation to catch and return runaway slave to — a sort of dirty disagreeable job which believe as a general rule the slave holder will not perform for another then again in the control of the government the management of the partnership affair have greatly the advantage of by the constitution each state have senator each have a number of representatives in proportion to the number of people and each have a number of presidential elector equal to the whole number of senators|and|representative together but in ascertain the number of the people for this purpose slave be count as be equal to white the slave do not vote be only count and so use as to swell the influence of the white people 's vote the practical effect of this be more aptly show by a comparison of the|states|of|south|carolina and maine south|carolina have representative and so have maine south|carolina have presidential elector and so have maine this be precise equality so far and of course be equal in senators each have thus in the control of the government the states be equal precisely but how be in the number of white people maine have south|carolina have maine have twice as many as south|carolina and over thus each white man in south|carolina be more than the double of any man in maine this be all because south|carolina besides free people have slave the|south|carolinian have precisely the same advantage over the white man in every other free state as well as in maine be more than the double of any of in this crowd the same advantage but not to the same extent be hold by all the citizen of the slave states over those of the free and be an absolute truth without an exception that there be no voter in any slave state but who have more legal power in the government than any voter in any free state there be no instance of exact equality and the disadvantage be against the whole chapter through this principle in the aggregate give the slave states in the present congress additional representative be more than the whole majority by which pass the nebraska bill now all this be manifestly unfair yet do not mention to complain of in so far as be already settle be in the constitution and do not for that cause or any other cause propose to destroy or alter or disregard the constitution stand to fairly fully and firmly but when be tell must leave altogether to other people to say whether new partner be to be breed up and bring into the firm on the same degrading term against respectfully demur insist that whether shall be a whole man or only the half of in comparison with other be a question in which be somewhat concerned and one which no other man can have a sacred right of decide for if be wrong in this if really be a sacred right of self government in the man who shall go to nebraska to decide whether will be the equal of or the double of then after shall have exercise that right and thereby shall have reduce to a still small fraction of a man than already be should like for some gentleman deeply skilled in the mystery of sacred right to provide with a microscope and peep about and find out if can what have become of sacred right will surely be too small for detection with the naked eye finally insist that if there be any thing which be the duty of the whole people to never entrust to any hand but own that thing be the preservation and perpetuity of own liberty and institution and if shall think as do that the extension of slavery endanger more than any or all other cause how recreant to if submit the question and with the fate of country to a mere hand full of man bend only on temporary self interest if this question of slavery extension be an insignificant have no power to do harm may be shuffle aside in this way but be as be the great behemoth of danger shall the strong gripe of the nation be loosen upon to entrust to the hand of such feeble keeper have do with this mighty argument of self government go sacred thing go in peace but nebraska be urge as a great union save measure well too go for save the union much as hate slavery would consent to the extension of rather than see the union dissolve just as would consent to any great evil to avoid a greater one but when go to union saving must believe at least that the mean employ have some adaptation to the end to mind nebraska have no such adaptation “ hath no relish of salvation in be an aggravation rather of the only thing which ever endanger the union when come upon all be peace and quiet the nation be look to the forming of new bond of union and a long course of peace and prosperity seem to lie before in the whole range of possibility there scarcely appear to to have be any thing out of which the slavery agitation could have be revive except the very project of repeal the missouri compromise every inch of territory own already have a definite settlement of the slavery question and by which all party be pledge to abide indeed there be no uninhabited country on the continent which could acquire if except some extreme northern region which be wholly out of the question in this state of case the genius of discord could scarcely have invent a way of again get by the ear but by turn back and destroy the peace measure of the past the council of that genius seem to have prevail the missouri compromise be repeal and here be in the midst of a new slavery agitation such think as have never see before who be responsible for this be those who resist the measure or those who causelessly bring forward and press through have reason to know and in fact know must and would be so resist could not but be expect by author that would be look upon as a measure for the extension of slavery aggravate by a gross breach of faith argue as will and long as will this be the naked front and aspect of the measure and in this aspect could not but produce agitation slavery be found in the selfishness of man 's nature opposition to be love of justice these principle be an eternal antagonism and when bring into collision so fiercely as slavery extension bring shock and throe and convulsion must ceaselessly follow repeal the missouri compromise repeal all compromise repeal the declaration of independence — repeal all past history still can not repeal human nature still will be the abundance of man 's heart that slavery extension be wrong and out of the abundance of heart mouth will continue to speak the structure too of the nebraska bill be very peculiar the people be to decide the question of slavery for but when be to decide or how be to decide or whether when the question be once decide be to remain so or be to be subject to an indefinite succession of new trial the law do not say be to be decide by the first dozen settler who arrive there or be to await the arrival of a|hundred be to be decide by a vote of the people or a vote of the legislature or indeed by a vote of any sort to these question the law give no answer there be a mystery about this for when a member propose to give the legislature express authority to exclude slavery be hoot down by the friend of the bill this fact be worth remember some yankee in the east be send emigrant to nebraska to exclude slavery from and so far as can judge expect the question to be decide by voting in some way or other but the missourians be awake too be within a stone 's throw of the contest ground hold meeting and pass resolution in which not the slight allusion to voting be make resolve that slavery already exist in the territory that more shall go there that remain in missouri will protect and that abolitionist shall be hang or drive away through all this bowie knife and shooter be see plainly enough but never a glimpse of the ballot box and really what be to be the result of this each party within have numerous and determined backer without be not probable that the contest will come to blow and bloodshed could there be a more apt invention to bring about collision and violence on the slavery question than this nebraska project be do not charge or believe that such be intend by congress but if have literally form a ring and place champion within to fight out the controversy the fight could be no more likely to come off than be and if this fight should begin be likely to take a very peaceful union save turn will not the first drop of blood so shed be the real knell of the union the missouri compromise ought to be restore for the sake of the union ought to be restore ought to elect a|house|of|representative which will vote restoration if by any mean omit to do this what follow slavery may or may not be establish in nebraska but whether be or not shall have repudiate — discard from the council of the nation the spirit of compromise for who after this will ever trust in a national compromise the spirit of mutual concession that spirit which first give the constitution and which have thrice save the union shall have strangle and cast from forever and what shall have in lieu of the south flush with triumph and tempt to excess the north betray as believe brood on wrong and burn for revenge side will provoke the other resent the one will taunt the other defy agree the other retaliate already a few in the north defy all constitutional restraint resist the execution of the fugitive slave law and even menace the institution of slavery in the state where exist already a few in the south claim the constitutional right to take to and hold slave in the free state demand the revival of the slave trade and demand a treaty with great|britain by which fugitive slave may be reclaim from canada as yet be but few on either side be a grave question for the lover of the union whether the final destruction of the missouri compromise and with the spirit of all compromise will or will not embolden and embitter each of these and fatally increase the number of both but restore the compromise and what then thereby restore the national faith the national confidence the national feeling of brotherhood thereby reinstate the spirit of concession and compromise — that spirit which have never fail in past peril and which may be safely trust for all the future the south ought to join in do this the peace of the nation be as dear to as to in memory of the past and hope of the future share as largely as would be on part a great act — great in spirit and great in effect would be worth to the nation a|hundred|years ' purchase of peace and prosperity and what of sacrifice would make only surrender to what give for a consideration long long ago what have not now ask for struggle or care for what have be thrust upon not less to own astonishment than to but be say can not restore that though elect every member of the low house the senate be still against be quite true that of the senators who pass the nebraska bill a majority of the whole senate will retain seat in spite of the election of this and the|next|year but if at these election several constituency shall clearly express will against nebraska will these senator disregard will will neither obey nor make room for those who will but even if fail to technically restore the compromise be still a great point to carry a popular vote in favor of the restoration the moral weight of such a vote can not be estimate too highly the author of nebraska be not at all satisfied with the destruction of the compromise an endorsement of this principle proclaim to be the great object with nebraska alone be a small matter — to establish a principle for future use be what particularly desire that future use be to be the planting of slavery wherever in the wide world local and unorganized opposition can not prevent now if wish to give this endorsement if wish to establish this principle do so shall regret but be right on the contrary if be oppose to the principle — intend to give no such endorsement let no wheedling no sophistry divert from throw a direct vote against some man mostly whig who condemn the repeal of the missouri compromise nevertheless hesitate to go for restoration lest be throw in company with the abolitionist will allow as an old whig to tell good humoredly that think this be very silly stand with anybody that stand right stand with while be right and part with when go wrong stand with the abolitionist in restore the missouri compromise and stand against when attempt to repeal the fugitive slave law in the latter case stand with the southern disunionist what of that be still right in both case be right in both case oppose the dangerous extreme in both stand on middle ground and hold the ship level and steady in both be national and nothing less than national this be good old whig ground to desert such ground because of any company be to be less than a whig less than a man less than an american particularly object to the new position which the avowed principle of this nebraska law give to slavery in the body politic object to because assume that there can be moral right in the enslaving of man by another object to as a dangerous dalliance for a few people a sad evidence that feel prosperity forget right that liberty as a principle have cease to revere object to because the father of the republic eschew and reject the argument of “ necessity be the only argument ever admit in favor of slavery and so far and so far only as carry do ever go find the institution exist among which could not help and cast blame upon the british king for have permit introduction before the constitution prohibit introduction into the north western territory the only country own then free from at the framing and adoption of the constitution forbore to so much as mention the word slave or slavery in the whole instrument in the provision for the recovery of fugitive the slave be speak of as a person hold to service or labor in that prohibit the abolition of the african slave trade for twenty|years that trade be speak of as the migration or importation of such person as any of the state now exist shall think proper to admit & c. these be the only provision allude to slavery thus the thing be hide away in the constitution just as an afflicted man hide away a wen or a cancer which dare not cut out at once lest blee to death with the promise nevertheless that the cutting may begin at the end of a give time less than this father could not do and now would not do necessity drive so far and farther would not go but this be not all the early congress under the constitution take the same view of slavery hedge and hem in to the narrow limit of necessity in prohibit an out go slave trade that is the taking of slave from the|united|state to sell in prohibit the bringing of slave from africa into the mississippi territory this territory then comprise what be now of mississippi and alabama this be ten|years before have the authority to do the same thing as to the state exist at the adoption of the constitution in prohibit american citizen from trading in slave between foreign country as for instance from africa to brazil in pass a law in aid of or state law in restraint of the internal slave trade in in apparent hot haste pass the law in advance to take effect the|first|day of 1808—the very first day the constitution would permit prohibit the african slave trade by heavy pecuniary and corporal penalty in find these provision ineffectual declare the trade piracy and annex to the extreme penalty of death while all this be pass in the general government or of the original slave states have adopt system of gradual emancipation and by which the institution be rapidly become extinct within these limit thus see the plain unmistakable spirit of that age towards slavery be hostility to the principle and toleration only by necessity but now be to be transform into a sacred right nebraska bring forth place on the high road to extension and perpetuity and with a pat on back say to “ go and god speed henceforth be to be the chief jewel of the nation the very figure head of the ship of state little by little but steadily as man 's march to the grave have be give up the old for the new faith near eighty|years|ago begin by declare that all man be create equal but now from that begin have run down to the other declaration that for some man to enslave others be a sacred right of self government these principle can not stand together be as opposite as god and mammon and whoever hold to the one must despise the other when pettit in connection with support of the nebraska bill call the|declaration|of|independence “ a self evident lie only do what consistency and candor require all other nebraska man to do of the odd nebraska senators who sit present and hear no one rebuke nor be apprize that any nebraska newspaper or any nebraska orator in the whole nation have ever yet rebuke if this have be say among marion 's man southerner though be what would have become of the man who say if this have be say to the man who capture andre the man who say would probably have be hang sooner than andre be if have be say in old independence|hall the very door keeper would have throttle the man and thrust into the street let no one be deceive the spirit of and the spirit of nebraska be utter antagonism and the former be be rapidly displace by the latter fellow countryman americans south as well as north shall make no effort to arrest this already the liberal party throughout the world express the apprehension “ that the retrograde institution in america be undermine the principle of progress and fatally violate the noble political system the world ever see this be not the taunt of enemy but the warning of friend be quite safe to disregard — to despise be there no danger to liberty in discard the early practice and first precept of ancient faith in greedy chase to make profit of the negro let beware lest “ cancel and tear to piece even the white man 's charter of freedom republican robe be soil and trail in the dust let repurify let turn and wash white in the spirit if not the blood of the revolution let turn slavery from claim of moral right back upon exist legal right and argument of “ necessity let return to the position father give and there let rest in peace let re - adopt the|declaration|of|independence and with the practice and policy which harmonize with let north and south let all americans — let all lover of liberty everywhere join in the great and good work if do this shall not only have save the union but shall have so save as to make and to keep forever worthy of the saving shall have so save that the succeed million of free happy people the world over shall rise up and call bless to the late generation at springfield where have speak substantially as have here judge douglas reply to — and as be to reply to here shall attempt to anticipate by notice some of the point make there commence by state have assume all the way through that the principle of the nebraska bill would have the effect of extend slavery deny that this be intended or that this effect would follow will not re - open the argument upon this point that such be the intention the world believe at the start and will continue to believe this be the countenance of the thing and both friend and enemy instantly recognize as such that countenance can not now be change by argument can as easily argue the color out of the negro ' skin like the bloody hand may wash and wash the red witness of guilt still stick and stare horribly at next say congressional intervention never prevent slavery any where — that do not prevent in the north west territory now in illinois that in fact illinois come into the union as a slave state that the principle of the nebraska bill expel from illinois from several old states from every where now this be mere quibble all the way through if the ordinance of do not keep slavery out of the north west territory how happen that the north west shore of the ohio river be entirely free from while the south east shore less than a mile distant along nearly the whole length of the river be entirely cover with if that ordinance do not keep out of illinois what be that make the difference between illinois and missouri lie side by side the mississippi river only divide while early settlement be within the same latitude between|1810|and|1820 the number of slave in missouri increased while in illinois in the same ten|year decrease this appear by the census return during nearly all of that ten|year both be territory not states during this time the ordinance forbid slavery to go into illinois and nothing forbid to go into missouri do go into missouri and do not go into illinois that be the fact can any doubt as to the reason of but say illinois come into the union as a slave state silence perhaps would be the good answer to this flat contradiction of the know history of the country what be the fact upon which this bold assertion be base when first acquire the country as far back as there be some slave within hold by the french inhabitant at kaskaskia the territorial legislation admit a few negro from the slave states as indenture servant one|year after the adoption of the first state constitution the whole number of be what do think just 117—while the aggregate free population be to upon this state of fact the people frame constitution prohibit the further introduction of slavery with a sort of guaranty to the owner of the few indentured servant give freedom to child to be bear thereafter and make no mention whatever of any suppose slave for life out of this small matter the judge manufacture argument that illinois come into the union as a slave state let the fact be the answer to the argument the principle of the nebraska bill say expel slavery from illinois the principle of that bill first plant here — that is first come because there be no law to prevent first come before own the country and find here and have the ordinance of to prevent increasing people struggle along and finally get rid of as best could but the principle of the nebraska bill abolish slavery in several of the old states well be true that several of the old states in the|last|quarter|of|the|last|century do adopt system of gradual emancipation by which the institution have finally become extinct within limit but may or may not be true that the principle of the nebraska bill be the cause that lead to the adoption of these measure be now more|than|fifty|year since the last of these states adopt system of emancipation if nebraska bill be the real author of these benevolent work be rather deplorable that have for so long a time cease work all together be there not some reason to suspect that be the principle of the revolution and not the principle of nebraska bill that lead to emancipation in these old state leave to the people of those old emancipate states and be quite sure will decide that neither that nor any other good thing ever do or ever will come of nebraska bill in the course of main argument judge douglas interrupt to say that the principle the nebraska bill be very old that originate when god make man and place good and evil before allow to choose for be responsible for the choice should make at the time think this be merely playful and answer accordingly but in reply to renew as a serious argument in seriousness then the fact of this proposition be not true as state god do not place good and evil before man tell to make choice on the contrary do tell there be tree of the fruit of which should not eat upon pain of certain death should scarcely wish so strong a prohibition against slavery in nebraska but this argument strike as not a little remarkable in another particular in strong resemblance to the old argument for the “ divine right of king by the latter the king be to do just as please with white subject be responsible to god alone by the former the white man be to do just as please with black slave be responsible to god alone the thing be precisely alike and be but natural that should find similar argument to sustain have argue that the application of the principle of self government as contend for would require the revival of the african slave trade that no argument could be make in favor of a man 's right to take slave to nebraska which could not be equally well make in favor of right to bring from the coast of africa the judge reply that the constitution require the suppression of the foreign slave trade but do not require the prohibition of slavery in the territory that be a mistake in point of fact the constitution do not require the action of congress in either case and do authorize in both and so there be still no difference between the case in regard to what have say the advantage the slave state have over the free in the matter of representation the judge reply that in the free states count free negro as white people while in the slave states count slave as white only and that the advantage at last be on the side of the free states now in the slave states count free negro just as do and so happen that besides slave have as many free negro as have and three|thousand over thus free negro more than balance our and advantage over in consequence of slave still remain as state in reply to argument that the compromise measure of be a system of equivalent and that the provision of no one of could fairly be carry to other subject without correspond equivalent be carry with the judge deny out right that these measure have any connection with or dependence upon each other this be mere desperation if have no connection why be always speak of in connection why have so spoken of a time why have constantly call a series of measure why do everybody call a compromise why be california keep out of the union six|or|seven|months if be not because of connection with the other measure webster 's lead definition of the verb “ to compromise be to adjust and settle a difference by mutual agreement with concession of claim by the party this convey precisely the popular understanding of the word compromise know before the judge tell that these measure pass separately and in distinct bill and that no of be pass by the vote of precisely the same member but also know and so do know that no one of could have pass both branch of congress but for the understanding that the other be to pass also upon this understanding each get vote which could have get in no other way be this fact that give to the measure true character and be the universal knowledge of this fact that have give the name of compromise so expressive of that true character have ask “ if in carry the provision of the utah and new|mexico law to nebraska could clear away other objection how can leave nebraska “ perfectly free to introduce slavery before form a constitution during territorial government?—while the utah and new|mexico law only authorize when form constitution and be admit into the union to this judge douglas answer that the utah and new|mexico law also authorize before and to prove this read from of law as follow that the legislative power of say territory shall extend to all rightful subject of legislation consistent with the constitution of the|united|state and the provision of this act now be perceive from the reading of this that there be nothing express upon the subject but that the authority be seek to be imply merely for the general provision of “ all rightful subject of legislation in reply to this insist as a legal rule of construction as well as the plain popular view of the matter that the express provision for utah and new|mexico come in with slavery if choose when shall form constitution be an exclusion of all imply authority on the same subject that congress have the subject distinctly in mind when make the express provision therein express whole meaning on that subject the judge rather insinuate that have find convenient to forget the washington territorial law pass in this be a division of oregon organize the northern part as the territory of washington assert that by this act the ordinance of theretofore exist in oregon be repeal that nearly all the member of congress vote for begin in the h.r. with of massachusetts and end with richard|yates of illinois and that could not understand how those who now oppose the nebraska bill so vote then unless be because be then too soon after both the great political party have ratify the compromise of and the ratification therefore too fresh to be then repudiate now have see the washington act before and have carefully examine since and aver that there be no repeal of the ordinance of or of any prohibition of slavery in in express term there be absolutely nothing in the whole law upon the subject — in fact nothing to lead a reader to think of the subject to judgment be equally free from every thing from which such repeal can be legally imply but however this may be be man now to be entrap by a legal implication extract from covert language introduce perhaps for the very purpose of entrap sincerely wish every man could read this law quite through carefully watch every sentence and every line for a repeal of the ordinance of or any thing equivalent to another point on the washington act if be intend to be model after the utah and new|mexico act as judge douglas insist why be not insert in as in that washington be to come in with or without slavery as may choose at the adoption of constitution have no such provision in and defy the ingenuity of man to give a reason for the omission other than that be not intend to follow the utah and new|mexico law in regard to the question of slavery the washington act not only differ vitally from the utah and new|mexico act but the nebraska act differ vitally from both by the latter act the people be leave “ perfectly free to regulate own domestic concern & c. but in all the former all law be to be submit to congress and if disapprove be to be null the washington act go even further absolutely prohibit the territorial legislation by very strong and guarded language from establish bank or borrow money on the faith of the territory be this the sacred right of self government hear vaunt so much no sir the nebraska bill find no model in the act of or the washington act find no model in any law from adam till today as phillips say of napoleon the nebraska act be grand gloomy and peculiar wrap in the solitude of own originality without a model and without a shadow upon the earth in the course of reply senator douglas remark in substance that have always consider this government be make for the white people and not for the negro why in point of mere fact think so too but in this remark of the judge there be a significance which think be the key to the great mistake if there be any such mistake which have make in this nebraska measure show that the judge have no very vivid impression that the negro be a human and consequently have no idea that there can be any moral question in legislate about in view the question of whether a new country shall be slave or free be a matter of as utter indifference as be whether neighbor shall plant farm with tobacco or stock with horned cattle now whether this view be right or wrong be very certain that the great mass of mankind take a totally different view consider slavery a great moral wrong and feeling against be not evanescent but eternal lie at the very foundation of sense of justice and can not be trifle with be a great and durable element of popular action and think no statesman can safely disregard senator also object that those who oppose in this measure do not entirely agree with another remind that in firm adherence to the constitutional right of the slave states differ widely from other who be co - operate with in oppose the nebraska bill and say be not quite fair to oppose in this variety of way should remember that take by surprise — astound by this measure be thunderstruck and stunned and reel and fall in utter confusion but rise each fighting grasp whatever could first reach a scythe a pitchfork a chopping axe or a butcher 's cleaver strike in the direction of the sound and be rapidly close in upon must not think to divert from purpose by show that drill dress and weapon be not entirely perfect and uniform when the storm shall be past shall find still americans no less devoted to the continue union and prosperity of the country than heretofore finally the judge invoke against the memory of clay and of webster be great man and man of great deed but where have assail for what be that life long enemy shall now make profit by assume to defend against life long friend go against the repeal of the missouri compromise do ever go for go for the compromise of do ever go against be greatly devoted to the union to the small measure of ability be ever less so clay and webster be dead before this question arise by what authority shall senator say would espouse side of if alive mr. clay be the lead spirit in make the missouri compromise be very credible that if now alive would take the lead in the breaking of the truth be that some support from whig be now a necessity with the judge and for thus be that the name of clay|and|webster be now invoke old friend have desert in such number as to leave too few to live by come to own and own receive not and lo turn unto the gentiles a word now as to the judge 's desperate assumption that the compromise of have no connection with another that illinois come into the union as a slave state and some other similar one this be no other than a bold denial of the history of the country if do not know that the compromises of be dependent on each other if do not know that illinois come into the union as a free state do not know any thing if do not know these thing do not know that ever have a revolutionary war or such a chief as washington to deny these thing be to deny national axiom or dogma at least and put an end to all argument if a man will stand up and assert and repeat and re - assert that and do not make know nothing in the power of argument that can stop think can answer the judge so long as stick to the premise but when fly from can not work an argument into the consistency of a maternal gag and actually close mouth with in such a case can only commend to the seventy|thousand answer just in from pennsylvania ohio and indiana transcript have receive the bill entitle an act make appropriation for the repair preservation and completion of certain public work heretofore commence under the authority of law reach in the|expiring|hours of the session and time do not allow full opportunity for examine and consider provision or of state at length the reason which forbid to give signature belong to that class of measure which be commonly know as internal improvement by the|general|government and which from a very early period have be deem of doubtful constitutionality and expediency and have thus fail to obtain the approbation of successive chief magistrates on such an examination of this bill as have be in power to make recognize in certain provision national in character and which if stand alone would be compatible with conviction of public duty to assent to but at the same time embrace other which be merely local and not in judgment warrant by any safe or true construction of the constitution to make proper and sound discrimination between these different pro - vision would require a deliberate discussion of general principle as well as a careful scrutiny of detail for the purpose of rightfully apply those principle to each separate item of appropriation public opinion with regard to the value and importance of internal improvement in the country be undivided there be a disposition on all hand to have prosecute with energy and to see the benefit seek to be attain by fully realize the prominent point of difference between those who have be regard as the friend of a system of internal improvement by the|general|government and those adverse to such a system have be of constitutional power though more or less connected with consideration of expediency own judgment be well know have on both ground be oppose to a general system of internal improvement by have entertain the most serious doubt from the inherent difficulty of application as well as from past unsatisfactory experience whether the power could be so exercise by the|general|government as to render use advantageous either to the country at large or effectual for the accomplishment of the object contemplate shall consider incumbent on to present to congress at next session a matured view of the whole subject and to endeavor to define approximately at least and accord to own conviction what appropriation of this nature by the|general|government the great interest of the|united|state require and the constitution will admit and sanction in case no substitute should be devise capable of reconcile difference both of constitutionality and expediency in the absence of the requisite mean and time for duly consider the whole subject at present and discuss such possible substitute become necessary to return this bill to the|house|of|representatives in which originate and for the reason thus briefly submit to the consideration of congress to withhold from approval transcript to the senate of the|united|state hasten to respond briefly to the resolution of the senate of this date request the president to inform the senate if in opinion be not incompatible with the public interest whether anything have arise since the date of message to the|house|of|representatives of the 15th of march last concern relation with the|government|of|spain which in opinion may dispense with the suggestion therein contain touch the propriety of provisional measure by congress to meet any exigency that may arise in the recess of congress affect those relation in the message to the|house|of|representatives refer to avail of the occasion to present the follow reflection and suggestion in view of the position of the island of cuba proximity to coast the relation which must ever bear to commercial and other interest be vain to expect that a series of unfriendly act infringe commercial right and the adoption of a policy threaten the honor and security of these states can long consist with peaceful relation in case the measure take for amicable adjustment of difficulty with spain should unfortunately fail shall not hesitate to use the authority and mean which congress may grant to insure the observance of just right to obtain redress for injury receive and to vindicate the honor of flag in anticipation of that contingency which earnestly hope may not arise suggest to congress the propriety of adopt such provisional measure as the exigency may seem to demand the houses|of|congress may have anticipate that the hope then express would be realize before the period of adjournment and that relation with spain would have assume a satisfactory condition so as to remove past cause of complaint and afford well security for tranquillity and justice in the future but be constrain to say that such be not the fact the formal demand for immediate reparation in the case of instead of have be meet on the part of spain by prompt satisfaction have only serve to call forth a justification of the local authority of cuba and thus to transfer the responsibility for act to the|spanish|government meanwhile information not only reliable in nature but of an official character be receive to the effect that preparation be make within the limit of the|united|state by private individual under military organization for a descent upon the island of cuba with a view to wrest that colony from the dominion of spain international comity the obligation of treaty and the express provision of law alike require in judgment that all the constitutional power of the executive should be exert to prevent the consummation of such a violation of positive law and of that good faith on which mainly the amicable relation of neighboring nation must depend in conformity with these conviction of public duty a proclamation be issue to warn all person not to participate in the contemplate enterprise and to invoke the interposition in this behalf of the proper officer of the government no provocation whatever can justify private expedition of hostility against a country at peace with the|united|state the power to declare war be vest by the constitution in congress and the experience of past history leave no room to doubt that the wisdom of this arrangement of constitutional power will continue to be verify whenever the national interest and honor shall demand a resort to ultimate measure of redress pende negotiation by the executive and before the action of congress individual could not be permit to embarrass the operation of the and usurp the power of the other of these depositary of the function of government have only to add that nothing have arise since the date of former message to dispense with the suggestion therein contain touch the propriety of provisional measure by congress transcript to the senate and house|of|representatif transmit herewith report of the secretary of state the secretary of the navy and the attorney general in reply to a resolution of the senate of the 24th of march last and also to a resolution of the|house|of|representatives of the 8th of may instant both have reference to the route of transit between the atlantic and pacific ocean through the republics of new granada and nicaragua and to the condition of affair in central|america these document relate to question of the high importance and interest to the people of the|united|state the narrow isthmus which connect the continent of north|and|south|america by the facility afford for easy transit between the atlantic and pacific ocean render the country of central|america an object of special consideration to all maritime nation which have be greatly augment in modern time by the operation of change in commercial relation especially those produce by the general use of steam as a motive power by land and sea to on account of geographical position and of political interest as an american state of primary magnitude that isthmus be of peculiar importance just as the|isthmus|of|suez be for correspond reason to the maritime power of europe but above all the importance to the|united|state of secure free transit across the american isthmus have render of paramount interest to since the settlement of the territories of oregon and washington and the accession of california to the union impel by these consideration the|united|state take step at an early day to assure suitable mean of commercial transit by canal railway or otherwise across this isthmus conclude in the first place a treaty of peace amity navigation and commerce with the|republic|of|new|granada among the condition of which be a stipulation on the part of new|granada guarantee to the|united|state the right of way or transit across that part of the isthmus which lie in the territory of new|granada in consideration of which the|united|state guarantee in respect of the same territory the right of sovereignty and property of new|granada the effect of this treaty be to afford to the people of the united|states facility for at once open a common road from chagre to panama and for at length construct a railway in the same direction to connect regularly with steamship for the transportation of mail specie and passenger to and fro between the atlantic and pacific|states and territories of the|united|state the|united|state also endeavor but unsuccessfully to obtain from the|mexican|republic the cession of the right of way at the northern extremity of the|isthmus|by|tehuantepec and that line of communication continue to be an object of solicitude to the people of this republic in the meantime intervene between the|republic|of|new|granada and lie the|state of guatemala salvador honduras nicaragua and costa|rica the several member of the former republic|of|central|america here in the territory of the|central|american|state be the narrow part of the isthmus and hither of course public attention have be direct as the most inviting field for enterprise of interoceanic communication between the opposite shore of america and more especially to the territory of the|states|of|nicaragua and honduras paramount to that of any european state as be the interest of the|united|state in the security and freedom of project line of travel across the isthmus by the way of nicaragua and honduras still do not yield in this respect to any suggestion of territorial aggrandizement or even of exclusive advantage either of communication or of commerce opportunity have not be want to the|united|state to procure such advantage by peaceful mean and with full and free assent of those who alone have any legitimate authority in the matter disregard those opportunity from consideration alike of domestic and foreign policy just as even to the|present|day have persevere in a system of justice and respect for the right and interest of other as well as own in regard to each and all of be with surprise and regret therefore that the|united|states learn a|few|days after the conclusion of the treaty of guadalupe|hidalgo by which the|united|state become with the consent of the|mexican|republic the rightful owner of california and thus invest with augmented special interest in the political condition of central|america that a military expedition under the authority of the|british|government have land at san|juan|del|norte in the|state|of|nicaragua and take forcible possession of that port the necessary terminus of any canal or railway across the isthmus within the territory of nicaragua do not diminish the unwelcomeness to of this act on the part of great|britain to find that assume to justify on the ground of an alleged protectorship of a small and obscure band of uncivilized indians whose proper name have even become lose to history who do not constitute a state capable of territorial sovereignty either in fact or of right and all political interest in whom and in the territory occupy great|britain have previously renounce by successive treaty with spain when spain be sovereign to the country and subsequently with independent nevertheless and injuriously affect as the|united|state conceive to have be by this act of the|british|government and by occupation about the same time of insular and of continental portion of the territory of the|state|of|honduras remember the many and powerful tie and mutual interest by which great|britain and the|united|state be associate and proceed in earnest good faith and with a sincere desire to do whatever may strengthen the bond of peace between to negotiate with great|britain a convention to assure the perfect neutrality of all interoceanic communication across the isthmus and as the indispensable condition of such neutrality the absolute independence of and complete sovereignty within the limit of own territory as well against great|britain as against the|united|state suppose have accomplish that object by the convention of april|19,|1850 which would never have be sign nor ratify on the part of the|united|state but for the conviction that in virtue of provision neither great|britain nor the|united|state be thereafter to exercise any territorial sovereignty in fact or in name in any part of central|america however or whensoever acquire either before or afterwards the essential object of the convention the neutralization of the isthmus would of course become a nullity if either great|britain or the|united|state be to continue to hold exclusively island or mainland of the isthmus and more especially if under any claim of protectorship of indians either government be to remain forever sovereign in fact of the atlantic shore of the states of costa|rica nicaragua and honduras have already communicate to the houses|of|congress full information of the protract and hitherto fruitless effort which the|united|state have make to arrange this international question with great|britain be refer to on the present occasion only because of intimate connection with the special object now to be bring to the attention of congress the unsettled political condition of some of the spanish american republics have never cease to be regard by this government with solicitude and regret on own account while have be the source of continual embarrassment in public and private relation with in the midst of the violent revolution and the war by which be continually agitate public authority be unable to afford due protection to foreigner and to foreign interest within territory or even to defend own soil against individual aggressor foreign or domestic the burden of the inconvenience and loss of which therefore devolve in no inconsiderable degree upon the foreign state associate with in close relation of geographical vicinity or of commercial intercourse such be more emphatically the situation of the|united|state with respect to the republics of mexico and of central|america notwithstanding however the relative remoteness of the|european|states from america fact of the same order have not fail to appear conspicuously in intercourse with spanish|american republics great|britain have repeatedly be constrain to recur to measure of force for the protection of british interest in those country france find necessary to attack the castle of san|juan|de|uloa and even to debark troop at in order to obtain redress of wrong do to frenchmen in mexico what be memorable in this respect in the conduct and policy of the|united|state be that while would be as easy for to annex and absorb new territory in america as be for european states to do this in asia or africa and while if do by may be justify as well on the alleged ground of the advantage which would accrue therefrom to the territory annex and absorb yet have abstain from do in obedience to consideration of right not less than of policy and that while the courageous and self reliant spirit of people prompt to hardy enterprise and occasionally yield to the temptation of take part in the trouble of country near at hand where know how potential influence moral and material must be the|american|government have uniformly and steadily resist all attempt of individual in the|united|state to undertake armed aggression against friendly spanish|american republics while the present incumbent of the executive office have be in discharge of duty have never fail to exert all the authority in vest to repress such enterprise because be in violation of the law of the land which the constitution require to execute faithfully because be contrary to the policy of the government and because to permit would be a departure from good faith toward those american republics in amity with which be entitle to and will never cease to enjoy in calamity the cordial sympathy and in prosperity the efficient good will of the government and of the people of the|united|state to say that law in this respect be sometimes violate or successfully evade be only to say what be true of all law in all country but not more so in the|united|state than in any one whatever of the country of europe suffice to repeat that the law of the|united|state prohibit all foreign military enlistment or expedition within territory have be execute with impartial good faith and so far as the nature of thing permit as well in repression of private person as of the official agent of other government both of europe and america among the|central|american|republic to which modern event have impart most prominence be that of nicaragua by reason of particular position on the isthmus citizen of the|united|state have establish in territory a regular interoceanic transit route second only in utility and value to the one previously establish in the territory of new|granada the condition of nicaragua would be believe have be much more prosperous than have be but for the occupation of only atlantic port by a foreign power and of the disturbing authority set up and sustain by the same power in a portion of territory by mean of which domestic sovereignty be impair public land be withhold from settlement and be deprive of all the maritime revenue which would otherwise collect on import merchandise at in these circumstance of the political debility of the|republic|of|nicaragua and when inhabitant be exhaust by long continue civil war between party neither of strong enough to overcome the other or permanently maintain internal tranquillity of the contend faction of the republic invite the assistance and cooperation of a small body of citizen of the|united|state from whose presence as appear put an end at once to civil war and restore apparent order throughout the territory of nicaragua with a new administration have at head a distinguished individual by birth a citizen of the republic d. patricio rivas as provisional president be the establish policy of the|united|state to recognize all government without question of source or organization or of the mean by which the govern person attain power provide there be a government accept by the people of the country and with reserve only of the time as to the recognition of revolutionary government arise out of the subdivision of parent state with which be in relation of amity do not go behind the fact of a foreign government exercise actual power to investigate question of legitimacy do not inquire into the cause which may have lead to a change of government to be indifferent whether a successful revolution have be aid by foreign intervention or not whether insurrection have overthrow exist government and another have be establish in place accord to preexist form or in a manner adopt for the occasion by those whom may find in the actual possession of power all these matter leave to the people and public authority of the particular country to determine and determination whether be by positive action or by ascertained acquiescence be to a sufficient warranty of the legitimacy of the new government during the|sixty seven|year which have elapse since the establishment of the exist government of the|united|state in all which time this union have maintain undisturbed domestic tranquillity have have occasion to recognize government found either by domestic revolution or by military invasion from abroad in many of the|governments|of|europe be the more imperatively necessary to apply this rule to the spanish american republics in consideration of the frequent and not seldom anomalous change of organization or administration which undergo and the revolutionary nature of most of these change of which the recent series of revolution in the|mexican|republic be an example where successive revolutionary government have make appearance in the course of a|few|month and be recognize successively each as the political power of that country by the|united|state when therefore some time since a new minister from the|republic|of|nicaragua present bear the commission of president rivas must and would have be receive as such unless be find on inquiry subject to personal exception but for the absence of satisfactory information upon the question whether president rivas be in fact the head of an establish government|of|the|republic|of|nicaragua doubt as to which arise not only from the circumstance of avowed association with armed emigrant recently from the|united|state but that the propose minister be of that class of person and not otherwise or previously a citizen of nicaragua another minister from the|republic|of|nicaragua have now present and have be receive as such satisfactory evidence appear that represent the government de and so far as such exist the government de jure of that republic that reception while in accordance with the establish policy of the|united|state be likewise call for by the most imperative special exigency which require that this government shall enter at once into diplomatic relation with that of nicaragua in the first place a difference have occur between the government of president rivas and the|nicaragua|transit|company which involve the necessity of inquiry into right of citizen of the|united|state who allege that have be aggrieve by the act of the former and claim protection and redress at the hand of government in the second place the interoceanic communication by the way of nicaragua be effectually interrupt and the person and property of unoffende private citizen of the|united|state in that country require the attention of government neither of these object can receive due consideration without resumption of diplomatic intercourse with the|government|of|nicaragua further than this the document communicate show that while the interoceanic transit by the way of nicaragua be cut off disturbance at panama have occur to obstruct temporarily at least that by the way of new|granada involve the sacrifice of the life and property of citizen of the|united|state a special commissioner have be dispatch to panama to investigate the fact of this occurrence with a view particularly to the redress of party aggrieve but measure of another class will be demand for the future security of interoceanic communication by this as by the other route of the isthmus would be difficult to suggest a single object of interest external or internal more important to the|united|states than the maintenance of the communication by land and sea between the atlantic and pacific|states and territories of the union be a material element of the national integrity and sovereignty have adopt such precautionary measure and have take such action for the purpose of afford security to the several transit route of central|america and to the person and property of citizen of the|united|state connect with or use the same as be within constitutional power and as exist circumstance have seem to demand should these measure prove inadequate to the object that fact will be communicate to congress with such recommendation as the exigency of the case may indicate transcript to the senate of the|united|state in transmit to the senate the report of the secretary of state together with the document therein refer to be the correspondence call for by the resolution of that body of the|9th|of|january|last deem proper to state briefly the reason which have deter from send to the senate for ratification the propose convention between the|united|states|of|america and the|united|mexican|state conclude by the respective plenipotentiary of the government on on the subject of a transit way across the|isthmus|of|tehuantepec without advert to the want of authority on the part of the american minister to conclude any such convention or to the action of this government in relation to the right of certain of citizen under the grant for a like object originally make to josé|garay the objection to upon face be numerous and should in judgment be regard as conclusive prominent among these objection be the fact that the convention bind to a foreign government to guarantee the contract of a private company with that government for the construction of the contemplate transit way to protect the person engage and property employ in the construction of the say work from the commencement thereof to completion against all confiscation spoliation or violence of whatsoever nature and to guarantee the entire security of the capital invest therein during the continuance of the contract such be the substance of the second and third article hence will be perceive that the obligation which this government be ask to assume be not to terminate in a|few|year or even with the present generation and again if the regulation which may be prescribe concern the traffic on say transit way shall be clearly contrary to the spirit and intention of this convention even then this government be not to be at liberty to withdraw protection and guaranty without first give one|year 's notice to the|mexican|government when the fact be duly consider that the responsibility of this government be thus pledge for a|long|series|of|year to the interest of a private company establish for purpose of internal improvement in a foreign country and that country peculiarly subject to civil war and other public vicissitude will be see how comprehensive and embarrassing would be those engagement to not less important than this objection be the consideration that the|united|stat can not agree to the term of this convention without disregard the provision of the eighth article of the convention which this government enter into with great|britain on april|19,|1850 which expressly include any interoceanic communication whatever by however inconvenient may be the condition of that convention still exist and the obligation of good faith rest alike upon the|united|state and without enlarge upon these and other questionable feature of the propose convention which will suggest to mind will only add that after the most careful consideration have deem duty not to ask for ratification by the senate

of nation since the date of the treaty of guadalupe so that each government in the most formal and effective manner shall be exempt and exonerate of all such obligation to each other respectively also recommend that the eighth article be modify by strike out all after the word attempt in the third line of that article the part to be omit be as follow mutually and especially obligate in all case of

public business be first in reliance on the wisdom and patriotism of the houses|of|congress and secondly in the direction afford by the principle of public polity affirm by father of the epoch of sanction by long experience and consecrate anew by the overwhelming voice of the people of the|united|state recur to these principle which constitute the organic basis of union perceive that vast as be the function and the duty of the|federal|government vest in or intrust to great department the legislative executive and judicial yet the substantive power the popular force and the large capacity for social and material development exist in the respective states which all be of well constitute republic as precede so alone be capable of maintain and perpetuate the|american|union the|federal|government have appropriate line of action in the specific and limited power confer on by the constitution chiefly as to those thing in which the states have a common interest in relation to another and to foreign government while the great mass of interest which belong to cultivate man the ordinary business of life the spring of industry all the diversify personal and domestic affair of society rest securely upon the general reserve power of the people of the several states there be the effective democracy of the nation and there the vital essence of being and greatness of the practical consequence which flow from the nature of the|federal|government the primary one be the duty of administer with integrity and fidelity the high trust repose in by the constitution especially in the application of the public fund as draw by taxation from the people and appropriate to specific object by congress happily have no occasion to suggest any radical change in the financial policy of the government be almost if not absolutely the solitary power of christendom have a surplus revenue draw immediately from impost on commerce and therefore measure by the spontaneous enterprise and national prosperity of the country with such indirect relation to agriculture manufacture and the product of the earth and sea as to violate no constitutional doctrine and yet vigorously promote the general welfare neither as to the source of the public treasure nor as to the manner of keep and manage do any grave controversy now prevail there be a general acquiescence in the wisdom of the present system the report of the secretary of the treasury will exhibit in detail the state of the public finance and the condition of the various branch of the public service administer by that department|of|the|government the revenue of the country levy almost insensibly to the taxpayer go on from|year|to|year increase beyond either the interest or the prospective want of the government at the close of the|fiscal|year|ending|june|30,|1852 there remain in the treasury a balance of the public revenue for the|fiscal|year|ending|june|30,|1853 amount to from custom and to from public land and other miscellaneous source amount together to while the public expenditure for the same period exclusive of payment on account of the public debt amount to leave a balance of of receipt above expenditure this fact of increase surplus in the treasury become the subject of anxious consideration at a very early period of administration and the path of duty in regard to seem to obvious and clear namely first to apply the surplus revenue to the discharge of the public debt so far as could judiciously be do and secondly to devise mean for the gradual reduction of the revenue to the standard of the public exigency of these object the first have be in the course of accomplishment in a manner and to a degree highly satisfactory the amount of the public debt of all class be on the|4th|of|march,|1853 payment on account of which have be make since that period to the amount of leave unpaid and in continuous course of liquidation the sum of these payment although make at the market price of the respective class of stock have be effect readily and to the general advantage of the treasury and have at the same time prove of signal utility in the relief have incidentally afford to the money market and to the industrial and commercial pursuit of the country the second of the above mention object that of the reduction of the tariff be of great importance and the plan suggest by the secretary of the treasury which be to reduce the duty on certain article and to add to the free list many article now tax and especially such as enter into manufacture and be not largely or at all produce in the country be commend to candid and careful consideration will find in the report of the secretary of the treasury also abundant proof of the entire adequacy of the present fiscal system to meet all the requirement of the public service and that while properly administer operate to the advantage of the community in ordinary business relation respectfully ask attention to sundry suggestion of improvement in the settlement of account especially as regard the large sum of outstanding arrear due to the government and of other reform in the administrative action of department which be indicate by the secretary as also to the progress make in the construction of marine hospital custom house and of a new mint in california and assay office in the city of new|york heretofore provide for by congress and also to the eminently successful progress of the|coast|survey and of the|light|house|board among the object merit attention will be important recommendation from the|secretaries|of|war|and|navy be fully satisfied that the navy of the|united|state be not in a condition of strength and efficiency commensurate with the magnitude of commercial and other interest and commend to especial attention the suggestion on this subject make by the secretary of the navy respectfully submit that the army which under system must always be regard with the high interest as a nucleus around which the volunteer force of the nation gather in the|hour of danger require augmentation or modification to adapt to the present extended limit and frontier relation of the country and the condition of the indian tribe in the interior of the continent the necessity of which will appear in the communication of the|secretaries|of|war and the interior in the administration of the|post office|department for the gross expenditure be and the gross receipt during the same period show that the current revenue fail to meet the current expense of the department by the sum of the cause which under the present postal system and law lead inevitably to this result be fully explain by the report of the|postmaster general great cause be the enormous rate the department have be compel to pay for mail service render by railroad company the exhibit in the report of the|postmaster general of the income and expenditure by mail steamer will be find peculiarly interesting and of a character to demand the immediate action of congress numerous and flagrant fraud upon have be bring to light within the|last|year and in some instance merit punishment inflict but unfortunately in other guilty party have escape not through the want of sufficient evidence to warrant a conviction but in consequence of the provision of limitation in the exist law from the nature of these claim the remoteness of the tribunal to pass upon and the mode in which the proof be of necessity furnish temptation to crime have be greatly stimulate by the obvious difficulty of detection the defect in the law upon this subject be so apparent and so fatal to the end of justice that early action relate to be most desirable during the|last|fiscal|year 9,819,411|acre of the public land have be survey and bring into market within the same period the sale by public purchase and private entry amount to 1,083,495|acre locate under military bountys and warrant 6,142,360|acre locate under other certificate cede to the states as swamp land select for railroad and other object under act of congress 1,427,457|acre total amount of land dispose of within the|fiscal|year which be an increase in quantity sell and locate under land warrant and grant of over the|fiscal|year immediately precede the quantity of land sell during the|second|and|third|quarters|of|1852 be the amount receive therefor be the quantity sell the second and be 1,609,919|acre and the amount receive therefor the whole number of land warrant issue under exist law prior to the|30th|of|september last be of which there be outstanding at that date the quantity of land require to satisfy these outstanding warrant be 4,778,120|acre warrant have be issue to last under the act of 11th february call for under act of september|28,|1850 and march|22,|1852 call for make a total of 25,384,640|acre be believe that experience have verify the wisdom and justice of the present system with regard to the public domain in most essential particular will perceive from the report of the secretary of the interior that opinion which have often be express in relation to the operation of the land system as not be a source of revenue to the|federal|treasury be erroneous the net profit from the sale of the public land to june|30,|1853 amount to the sum of recommend the extension of the land system over the|territories|of|utah and new|mexico with such modification as peculiarity may require regard public domain as chiefly valuable to provide home for the industrious and enterprising be not prepared to recommend any essential change in the land system except by modification in favor of the actual settler and an extension of the preemption principle in certain case for reason and on ground which will be fully develop in the report to be lay before congress represent the proprietor of the territorial domain and charge especially with power to dispose of territory belong to the|united|state have for a long course of year begin with the administration of mr. jefferson exercise the power to construct road within the territories and there be so many and obvious distinction between this exercise of power and that of make road within the states that the former have never be consider subject to such objection as apply to the latter and such may now be consider the settle construction of the power of the|federal|government upon the subject numerous application have be and no doubt will continue to be make for grant of land in aid of the construction of railway be not believe to be within the intent and meaning of the constitution that the power to dispose of the public domain should be use otherwise than may be expect from a prudent proprietor and therefore that grant of land to aid in the construction of road should be restrict to case where would be for the interest of a proprietor under like circumstance thus to contribute to the construction of these work for the practical operation of such grant thus far in advance the interest ot the states in which the work be locate and at the same time the substantial interest of all the other states by enhance the value and promote the rapid sale of the public domain refer to the report of the secretary of the interior a careful examination however will show that this experience be the result of a just discrimination and will be far from afford encouragement to a reckless or indiscriminate extension of the principle commend to favorable consideration the man of genius of country who by invention and discovery in science and art have contribute largely to the improvement of the age without in many instance secure for anything like an adequate reward for many interesting detail upon this subject refer to the appropriate report and especially urge upon early attention the apparently slight but really important modification of exist law therein suggest the liberal spirit which have so long mark the action of congress in relation to the|district|of|columbia will have no doubt continue to be manifest the erection of an asylum for the insane of the|district|of|columbia and of the army and navy of the|united|state have be somewhat retard by the great demand for material and labor during the|past|summer but full preparation for the reception of patient before the return of another winter be anticipate and there be the good reason to believe from the plan and contemplated arrangement which have be devise with the large experience furnish within the|last|few|year in relation to the nature and treatment of the disease that will prove an asylum indeed to this most helpless and afflicted class of sufferer and stand as a noble monument of wisdom and mercy under the act of congress of august|31,|1852 and of march|3,|1853 design to secure for the city of washington and georgetown an abundant supply of good and wholesome water become duty to examine the report and plan of the engineer who have charge of the survey under the act first name the good if not the only plan calculate to secure permanently the object seek be that which contemplate take the water from the|great|fall of the potomac and consequently give to approval for the progress and present condition of this important work and for demand so far as appropriation be concerned refer to the report of the secretary of war the present judicial system of the|united|state have now be in operation for so long a period of time and have in general theory and much of detail become so familiar to the country and acquire so entirely the public confidence that if modify in any respect should only be in those particular which may adapt to the increase extent population and legal business of the|united|state in this relation the organization of the court be now confessedly inadequate to the duty to be perform by in consequence of which the|states|of|florida wisconsin iowa texas and california and district of other states be in effect exclude from the full benefit of the general system by the function of the circuit court be devolve on the district judge in all those state or part of states the spirit of the constitution and a due regard to justice require that all the states of the union should be place on the same footing in regard to the judicial tribunal therefore commend to consideration this important subject which in judgment demand the speedy action of congress will present to if deem desirable a plan which be prepared to recommend for the enlargement and modification of the present judicial system the act of congress establish the smithsonian|institution provide that the president of the|united|state and other person therein designate should constitute an establishment by that name and that the member should hold state and special meeting for the supervision of the affair of the institution the organization not have take place seem to proper that should be effect without delay this have be do and an occasion be thereby present for inspect the condition of the institution and appreciate successful progress thus far and high promise of great and general usefulness have omit to ask favorable consideration for the estimate of work of a local character in of the|thirty one|states amount to because independently of the ground which have so often be urge against the application of the federal revenue for work of this character inequality with consequent injustice be inherent in the nature of the proposition and because the plan have prove entirely inadequate to the accomplishment of the object seek the subject of internal improvement claim alike the interest and good will of all have nevertheless be the basis of much political discussion and have stand as a deep graven line of division between statesman of eminent ability and patriotism the rule of strict construction of all power delegate by the states to the|general|government have array from time to time against the rapid progress of expenditure from the|national|treasury on work of a local character within the|state memorable as an epoch in the history of this subject be the message of president jackson of the|27th|of|may,|1830 which meet the system of internal improvement in comparative infancy but so rapid have be growth that the project appropriation in that|year for work of this character have rise to the alarming amount of in that message the president admit the difficulty of bring back the operation of the government to the construction of the constitution set up in and mark as an admonitory proof of the necessity of guard that instrument with sleepless vigilance against the authority of precedent which have not the sanction of most plainly define power government exist under a write compact between sovereign states unite for specific object and with specific grant to general agent if then in the progress of administration there have be departure from the term and intent of the compact be and will ever be proper to refer back to the fix standard which father leave and to make a stern effort to conform action to would seem that the fact of a principle have be resist from the first by many of the wise and most patriotic man of the republic and a policy have provoke constant strife without arrive at a conclusion which can be regard as satisfactory to most earnest advocate should suggest the inquiry whether there may not be a plan likely to be crown by happy result without perceive any sound distinction or intend to assert any principle as oppose to improvement need for the protection of internal commerce which do not equally apply to improvement upon the seaboard for the protection of foreign commerce submit to whether may not be safely anticipate that if the policy be once settle against appropriation by the|general|government for local improvement for the benefit of commerce locality require expenditure would not by mode and mean clearly legitimate and proper raise the fund necessary for such construction as the safety or other interest of commerce may require if that can be regard as a system which in the experience of mere than thirty|years have at no time so command the public judgment as to give the character of a settle policy which though have produce some work of concede importance have be attend with an expenditure quite disproportionate to value and have result in squander large sum upon object which have answer no valuable purpose the interest of all the states require to be abandon unless hope may be indulge for the future which find no warrant in the past with an anxious desire for the completion of the work which be regard by all good citizen with sincere interest have deem duty to ask at hand a deliberate reconsideration of the question with a hope that animate by a desire to promote the permanent and substantial interest of the country wisdom may prove equal to the task of devise and mature a plan which apply to this subject may promise something well than constant strife the suspension of the power of local enterprise the exciting of vain hope and the disappointment of cherish expectation in expend the appropriation make by the last congress several case have arise in relation to work for the improvement of harbor which involve question as to the right of soil and jurisdiction and have threaten conflict between the authority of the state and general|governments the right to construct a breakwater jetty or dam would seem necessarily to carry with the power to protect and preserve such construction this can only be effectually do by have jurisdiction over the soil but no clause of the constitution be find on which to rest the claim of the|united|state to exercise jurisdiction over the soil of a state except that confer by the eighth section of the first article of the constitution be then submit whether in all case where construction be to be erect by the|general|government the right of soil should not first be obtain and legislative provision be make to cover all such case for the progress make in the construction of road within the territories as provide for in the appropriation of the last congress refer to the report of the secretary of war there be subject of a domestic nature which from intrinsic importance and the many interesting question of future policy which involve can not fail to receive early attention allude to the mean of communication by which different part of the wide expanse of country be to be place in close connection for purpose both of defense and commercial intercourse and more especially such as appertain to the communication of those great division of the union which lie on the opposite side of the|rocky|mountain that the government have not be unmindful of this heretofore be apparent from the aid have afford through appropriation for mail facility and other purpose but the general subject will now present under aspect more imposing and more purely national by reason of the survey order by congress and now in the process of completion for communication by railway across the continent and wholly within the limit of the|united|state the power to declare war to raise and support army to provide and maintain a navy and to call forth the militia to execute the law suppress insurrection and repel invasion be confer upon congress as mean to provide for the common defense and to protect a territory and a population now widespread and vastly multiply as incidental to and indispensable for the exercise of this power must sometimes be necessary to construct military road and protect harbor of refuge to appropriation by congress for such object no sound objection can be raise happily for country peaceful policy and rapidly increase population impose upon no urgent necessity for preparation and leave but few trackless desert between assailable point and a patriotic people ever ready and generally able to protect these necessary link the enterprise and energy of people be steadily and boldly struggle to supply all experience affirm that wherever private enterprise will avail be most wise for the|general|government to leave to that and individual watchfulness the location and execution of all mean of communication the survey before allude to be design to ascertain the most practicable and economical route for a railroad from the river mississippi to party be now in the field make exploration where previous examination have not supply sufficient datum and where there be the good reason to hope the object seek may be find the mean and time be both limit be not to be expect that all the accurate knowledge desire will be obtain but be hope that much and important information will be add to the stock previously possess and that partial if not full report of the survey order will be receive in time for transmission to the houses|of|congress on or before the first monday in february next as require by the act of appropriation the magnitude of the enterprise contemplate have arouse and will doubtless continue to excite a very general interest throughout the country in political commercial and military bearing have vary great and increase claim to consideration the heavy expense the great delay and at time fatality attend travel by either of the isthmus route have demonstrate the advantage which would result from interterritorial communication by such safe and rapid mean as a railroad would supply these difficulty which have be encounter in a period of peace would be magnify and still further increase in time of war but whilst the embarrassment already encounter and other under new contingency to be anticipate may serve strikingly to exhibit the importance of such a work neither these nor all consideration combine can have an appreciable value when weigh against the obligation strictly to adhere to the constitution and faithfully to execute the power confer within this limit and to the extent of the interest of the government involve would seem both expedient and proper if an economical and practicable route shall be find to aid by all constitutional mean in the construction of a road which will unite by speedy transit the population of the pacific and atlantic states to guard against misconception should be remark that although the power to construct or aid in the construction of a road within the limit of a territory be not embarrass by that question of jurisdiction which would arise within the limit of a state be nevertheless hold to be of doubtful power and more than doubtful propriety even within the limit of a territory for the|general|government to undertake to administer the affair of a railroad a canal or other similar construction and therefore that connection with a work of this character should be incidental rather than primary will only add at present that fully appreciate the magnitude of the subject and solicitous that the atlantic and pacific shore of the republic may be bind together by inseparable tie of common interest as well as of common fealty and attachment to the union shall be dispose so far as own action be concern to follow the light of the constitution as expound and illustrate by those whose opinion and exposition constitute the standard of political faith in regard to the power of the|federal|government be trust not necessary to say that no grandeur of enterprise and no present urgent inducement promise popular favor will lead to disregard those light or to depart from that path which experience have prove to be safe and which be now radiant with the glow of prosperity and legitimate constitutional progress can afford to wait but can not afford to overlook the ark of security be no part of purpose to give prominence to any subject which may properly be regard as set at rest by the deliberate judgment of the people but while the present be bright with promise and the future full of demand and inducement for the exercise of active intelligence the past can never be without useful lesson of admonition and instruction if danger serve not as beacon will evidently fail to fulfill the object of a wise design when the grave shall have close over all who be now endeavor to meet the obligation of duty the|year|1850 will be recur to as a period fill with anxious apprehension a successful war have just terminate peace bring with a vast augmentation of territory disturbing question arise bear upon the domestic institution of portion of the confederacy and involve the constitutional right of the states but notwithstanding difference of opinion and sentiment which then exist in relation to detail and specific provision the acquiescence of distinguished citizen whose devotion to the union can never be doubt have give renew vigor to institution and restore a sense of repose and security to the public mind throughout the confederacy that this repose be to suffer no shock during official term if have power to avert those who place here may be assure the wisdom of man who know what independence cost who have put all at stake upon the issue of the revolutionary struggle dispose of the subject to which refer in the only way consistent with the|union|of|these|states and with the march of power and prosperity which have make what be be a significant fact that from the adoption of the constitution until the officer and soldier of the revolution have pass to grave or through the infirmity of age and wound have cease to participate actively in public affair there be not merely a quiet acquiescence in but a prompt vindication of the constitutional right of the states the reserve power be scrupulously respect no statesman put forth the narrow view of casuist to justify interference and agitation but the spirit of the compact be regard as sacred in the eye of honor and indispensable for the great experiment of civil liberty which environ by inherent difficulty be yet bear forward in apparent weakness by a power superior to all obstacle there be no condemnation which the voice of freedom will not pronounce upon should prove faithless to this great trust while man inhabit different part of this vast continent can no more be expect to hold the same opinion or entertain the same sentiment than every variety of climate or soil can be expect to furnish the same agricultural product can unite in a common object and sustain common principle essential to the maintenance of that object the gallant man of the south and the north could stand together during the struggle of the revolution could stand together in the more trying period which succeed the clangor of arm as united valor be adequate to all the trial of the camp and danger of the field so united wisdom prove equal to the great task of found upon a deep and broad basis institution which have be privilege to enjoy and will ever be most sacred duty to sustain be but the feeble expression of a faith strong and universal to say that son whose blood mingle so often upon the same field during and who have more recently bear in triumph the flag of the country upon a foreign soil will never permit alienation of feeling to weaken the power of united effort nor internal dissension to paralyze the great arm of freedom uplifted for the vindication of self government have thus briefly present such suggestion as seem to especially worthy of consideration in provide for the present can hardly fail to avail yourself of the light which the experience of the past cast upon the future the growth of population have now bring in the destine career of national history to a point at which well behoove to expand vision over the vast prospective the successive decennial return of the census since the adoption of the constitution have reveal a law of steady progressive development which may be state in general term as a duplication every|quarter|century carry forward from the point already reach for only a short period of time as applicable to the existence of a nation this law of progress if unchecked will bring to almost incredible result a large allowance for a diminished proportional effect of emigration would not very materially reduce the estimate while the increase average duration of human life know to have already result from the scientific and hygienic improvement of the|past|fifty|years will tend to keep up through the|next|fifty or perhaps the same ratio of growth which have be thus reveal in past progress and to the influence of these cause may be add the influx of laboring masse from eastern asia to the pacific side of possession together with the probable accession of the population already exist in other part of hemisphere which within the period in question will feel with yearly increase force the natural attraction of so vast powerful and prosperous a confederation of self govern republic and will seek the privilege of be admit within safe and happy bosom transfer with by a peaceful and healthy process of incorporation spacious region of virgin and exuberant soil which be destine to swarm with the fast growing and fast spread million of race these consideration seem fully to justify the presumption that the law of population above state will continue to act with undiminished effect through at|least|the|next|half|century and that thousand of person who have already arrive at maturity and be now exercise the right of freeman will close eye on the spectacle of of population embrace within the majestic proportion of the|american|union be not merely as an interesting topic of speculation that present these view for consideration have important practical bearing upon all the political duty be call upon to perform heretofore system of government have work on what may be term a miniature scale in comparison with the development which must thus assume within a future so near at hand as scarcely to be beyond the present of the exist generation be evident that a confederation so vast and so varied both in number and in territorial extent in habit and in interest could only be keep in national cohesion by the strict fidelity to the principle of the constitution as understand by those who have adhere to the most restricted construction of the power grant by the people and the states interpret and apply accord to those principle the great compact adapt with healthy ease and freedom to an unlimited extension of that benign system of federative self government of which be glorious and trust immortal charter let then with redouble vigilance be on guard against yield to the temptation of the exercise of doubtful power even under the pressure of the motif of concede temporary advantage and apparent temporary expediency the minimum of federal government compatible with the maintenance of national unity and efficient action in relation with the rest of the world should afford the rule and measure of construction of power under the general clause of the constitution a spirit of strict deference to the sovereign right and dignity of every state rather than a disposition to subordinate the states into a provincial relation to the central authority should characterize all exercise of the respective power temporarily vest in as a sacred trust from the generous confidence of constituent in like manner as a manifestly indispensable condition of the perpetuation of the union and of the realization of that magnificent national future advert to do the duty become yearly strong and clear upon as citizen of the several states to cultivate a fraternal and affectionate spirit language and conduct in regard to other states and in relation to the varied interest institution and habit of sentiment and opinion which may respectively characterize mutual forbearance respect and noninterference in personal action as citizen and an enlarged exercise of the most liberal principle of comity in the public dealing of state with state whether in legislation or in the execution of law be the mean to perpetuate that confidence and fraternity the decay of which a mere political union on so vast a scale could not long survive in still another point of view be an important practical duty suggest by this consideration of the magnitude of dimension to which political system with corresponding machinery of government be so rapidly expand with increase vigilance do require to cultivate the cardinal virtue of public frugality and official integrity and purity public affair ought to be so conduct that a settle conviction shall pervade the entire union that nothing short of the high tone and standard of public morality mark every part of the administration and legislation of thus will the federal system whatever expansion time and progress may give continue more and more deeply rooted in the love and confidence of the people that wise economy which be as far remove from parsimony as from corrupt and corrupt extravagance that single regard for the public good which will frown upon all attempt to approach the treasury with insidious project of private interest cloak under public pretext that sound fiscal administration which in the legislative department guard against the dangerous temptation incident to overflow revenue and in the executive maintain an unsleeping watchfulness against the tendency of all national expenditure to extravagance while be admit elementary political duty may trust be deem as properly advert to and urge in view of the more impressive sense of that necessity which be directly suggest by the consideration now present since the adjournment of congress the vice president of the|united|state have pass from the scene of earth without have enter upon the duty of the station to which have be call by the voice of countryman have occupy almost continuously for more|than|thirty|year a seat in or the other of the houses|of|congress and have by singular purity and wisdom secure unbounded confidence and universal respect fail health be watch by

conscious of no motif on part which be not inseparable from the honor and advancement of country hope may be privilege to deserve and secure not only cordial cooperation in great public measure but also those relation of mutual confidence and regard which be always so desirable to cultivate between member of coordinate branch of the government transcript countryman a relief to feel that no heart

make a matter of urgent importance be at first apprehend that an increase naval force have be order to the fishing ground to carry into effect the british interpretation of those provision in the convention of in reference to the true intent of which the government differ be soon discover that such be not the design of great|britain and satisfactory explanation of the real object of the measure have be give both here and in london the unadjusted difference however between the government as to the interpretation of the first article of the convention of be still a matter of importance american fishing vessel within nine|or|ten|year have be exclude from water to which have free access for five|year after the negotiation of the treaty in this exclusion be relax so far as concern the|bay|of|fundy but the just and liberal intention of the home government in compliance with what think the true construction of the convention to open all the other outer bay to fisherman be abandon in consequence of the opposition of the colony notwithstanding this the|united|state have since the|bay|of|fundy be reopen to fisherman in pursue the most liberal course toward the colonial fishing interest by the revenue law of the duty on colonial fish enter port be very greatly reduce and by the warehousing act be allow to be enter in bond without payment of duty in this way colonial fish have acquire the monopoly of the export trade in market and be enter to some extent into the home consumption these fact be among those which increase the sensibility of fishing interest at the movement in question these circumstance and the incident above allude to have lead to think the moment favorable for a reconsideration of the entire subject of the fishery on the coast of the|british|province with a view to place upon a more liberal footing of reciprocal privilege a willingness to meet in some arrangement of this kind be understand to exist on the part of great|britain with a desire on part to include in comprehensive settlement as well this subject as the commercial intercourse between the|united|state and the|british|province have think that whatever arrangement may be make on these subject be expedient that should be embrace in separate convention the illness and death of the late secretary of state prevent the commencement of the contemplated negotiation pain have be take to collect the information require for the detail of such an arrangement the subject be attend with considerable difficulty if be find practicable to come to an agreement mutually acceptable to the party convention may be conclude in the course of the present winter the control of congress over all the provision of such an arrangement affect the revenue will of course be reserve the affair of cuba form a prominent topic in last annual message remain in an uneasy condition and a feeling of alarm and irritation on the part of the cuban authority appear to exist this feeling have interfere with the regular commercial intercourse between the|united|state and the island and lead to some act of which have a fight to complain but the captain general of cuba be clothe with no power to treat with foreign government nor be in any degree under the control of the spanish minister at washington any communication which may hold with an agent of a foreign power be informal and matter of courtesy anxious to put an end to the exist inconvenience which seem to rest on a misconception direct the newly appoint minister to mexico to visit havana on way to vera|cruz be respectfully receive by the|captain general who confer with freely on the recent occurrence but no permanent arrangement be effect in the meantime the refusal of the captain generalto allow passenger and the mail to be land in certain case for a reason which do not furnish in the opinion of this government even a good presumptive ground for such prohibition have be make the subject of a serious remonstrance at madrid and have no reason to doubt that due respect will be pay by the|government|of|her|catholic|majesty to the representation which minister have be instruct to make on the subject be but justice to the captain general to add that conduct toward the steamer employ to carry the mail of the|united|state to havana have with the exception above allude to be mark with kindness and liberality and indicate no general purpose of interfere with the commercial correspondence and intercourse between the island and this country early in the|present|year official note be receive from the minister of france and england inviting the|government|of|the|united|state to become a party with great|britain and france to a tripartite convention in virtue of which the power should severally and collectively disclaim now and for the future all intention to obtain possession of the island of cuba and should bind to discountenance all attempt to that effect on the part of any power or individual whatever this invitation have be respectfully decline for reason which would occupy too much space in this communication to state in detail but which lead to think that the propose measure would be of doubtful constitutionality impolitic and unavaile have however in common with several of predecessor direct the minister of france and england to be assure that the|united|state entertain no design against cuba but that on the contrary should regard incorporation into the union at the present time as fraught with serious peril be this island comparatively destitute of inhabitant or occupy by a kindre race should regard if voluntarily cede by spain as a most desirable acquisition but under exist circumstance should look upon incorporation into union as a very hazardous measure would bring into the confederacy a population of a different national stock speak a different language and not likely to harmonize with the other member would probably affect in a prejudicial manner the industrial interest of the south and may revive those conflict of opinion between the different section of the country which lately shake the union to center and which have be so happily compromise the rejection by the|mexican|congress of the convention which have be conclude between that republic and the|united|state for the protection of a transit way across the|isthmus|of|tehuantepec and of the interest of those citizen of the|united|state who have become proprietor of the right which mexico have confer on of own citizen in regard to that transit have throw a serious obstacle in the way of the attainment of a very desirable national object be still willing to hope that the difference on the subject which exist or may hereafter arise between the government will be amicably adjust this subject however have already engage the attention of the senate of the|united|state and require no further comment in this communication the settlement of the question respect the port of san|juan|de|nicaragua and of the controversy between the republics of costa|rica and nicaragua in regard to boundary be consider indispensable to the commencement of the ship canal between the ocean which be the subject of the convention between the|united|state and of the|19th|of|april,|1850 accordingly a proposition for the same purpose address to the government in that|quarter and to the|mosquito|indian be agree to in april last by the secretary of state and the minister of her|britannic|majesty besides the wish to aid in reconcile the difference of the republics engage in the negotiation from a desire to place the great work of a ship canal between the ocean under jurisdiction and to establish the important port of san|juan|de|nicaragua under the government of a civilized power the proposition in question be assent to by costs|rica and the mosquito indians have not prove equally acceptable to nicaragua but be to be hope that the further negotiation on the subject which be in train will be carry on in that spirit of conciliation and compromise which ought always to prevail on such occasion and that will lead to a satisfactory result have the satisfaction to inform that the executive government of venezuela have acknowledge some claim of citizen of the|united|state which have for many|years past be urge by charge at caracas be hope that the same sense of justice will actuate the congress of that republic in provide the mean for payment the recent revolution in and the|confederated|state have open the prospect of an improve state of thing in that|quarter the|governments|of|great|britain and france determine to negotiate with the chief of the new confederacy for the free access of commerce to the extensive country water by the tributary of the|la|plata and give a friendly notice of this purpose to the|united|state that may if think proper pursue the same course in compliance with this invitation minister at rio|janeiro and charge d'affaire at buenos|ayre have be fully authorize to conclude treaty with the newly organize confederation or the states compose the delay which have take place in the formation of the new government have as yet prevent the execution of those instruction but there be every reason to hope that these vast country will be eventually open to commerce a treaty of commerce have be conclude between the|united|state and the|oriental|republic|of|uruguay which will be lay before the senate should this convention go into operation will open to the commercial enterprise of citizen a country of great extent and unsurpassed in natural resource but from which foreign nation have hitherto be almost wholly exclude the correspondence of the late secretary of state with the peruvian charge d'affaire relative to the|lobos|islands be communicate to congress toward the close of the last session since that time on further investigation of the subject the doubt which have be entertain of the title of peru to those island have be remove and have deem just that the temporary wrong which have be unintentionally do from want of information should be repair by an unreserved acknowledgment of sovereignty have the satisfaction to inform that the course pursue by peru have be creditable to the liberality of government before be know by that title would be acknowledge at washington minister of foreign affair have authorize charge at lima to announce to the american vessel which have go to the lobos for guano that the|peruvian|government be willing to freight on own account this intention have be carry into effect by the peruvian minister here by an arrangement which be believe to be advantageous to the party in interest settlement on the shore of the pacific have already give a great extension and in some respect a new direction to commerce in that ocean a direct and rapidly increase intercourse have spring up with eastern asia the water of the|northern|pacific even into the|arctic|sea have of late|year be frequent by whaleman the application of steam to the general purpose of navigation be become daily more common and make desirable to obtain fuel and other necessary supply at convenient point on the route between asia and pacific shore unfortunate countryman who from time to time suffer shipwreck on the coast of the eastern sea be entitle to protection besides these specific object the general prosperity of states on the pacific require that an attempt should be make to open the opposite region of asia to a mutually beneficial intercourse be obvious that this attempt could be make by no power to so great advantage as by the|united|state whose constitutional system exclude every idea of distant colonial dependency have accordingly be lead to order an appropriate naval force to japan under the command of a discreet and intelligent officer of the high rank know to service be instruct to endeavor to obtain from the government of that country some relaxation of the inhospitable and antisocial system which have pursue for about|two|centurie have be direct particularly to remonstrate in the strong language against the cruel treatment to which shipwreck mariner have often be subject and to insist that shall be treat with humanity be instruct however at the same time to give that government the ample assurance that the object of the|united|state be such and such only as have indicate and that the expedition be friendly and peaceful notwithstanding the jealousy with which the government of eastern asia regard all overture from foreigner be not without hope of a beneficial result of the expedition should be crown with success the advantage will not be confine to the|united|state but as in the case of china will be equally enjoy by all the other maritime power have much satisfaction in state that in all the step preparatory to this expedition the government of the|united|state have be materially aid by the good office of the|king|of|the|netherland the only european power have any commercial relation with japan in pass from this survey of foreign relation invite the attention of congress to the condition of that department|of|the|government to which this branch of the public business be intrust intercourse with foreign power have of late|year greatly increase both in consequence of own growth and the introduction of many new state into the family of nation in this way the|department|of|state have become overburdened have by the recent establishment of the|department|of|the|interior be relieve of some portion of the domestic business if the residue of the business of that kind such as the distribution of congressional document the keeping publishing and distribution of the law of the|united|state the execution of the copyright law the subject of reprieve and pardon and some other subject relate to interior administration should be transfer from the|department|of|state would unquestionably be for the benefit of the public service would also suggest that the building appropriate to the|state|department be not fireproof that there be reason to think there be defect in construction and that the archive of the government in charge of the department with the precious collection of the manuscript paper of washington jefferson hamilton madison and monroe be expose to destruction by fire a similar remark may be make of the building appropriate to the|war|and navy departments the condition of the treasury be exhibit in the annual report from that department the cash receipt into the treasury for the|fiscal|year|ending|the|30th|june|last exclusive of trust fund be and the expenditure for the same period likewise exclusive of trust fund be of which be on account of the principal and interest of the public debt include the last installment of the indemnity to mexico under the treaty of guadalupe|hidalgo leave a balance of in the treasury on the|1st|day|of|july|last since this latter period further purchase of the principal of the public debt have be make to the extent of and the surplus in the treasury will continue to be apply to that object whenever the stock can be procure within the limit as to price authorize by law the value of foreign merchandise import during the|last|fiscal|year be and the value of domestic production export be besides of foreign merchandise export make the aggregate of the entire export exclusive of the above there be export in specie and import from foreign port in first annual message to congress call attention to what seem to some defect in the present tariff and recommend such modification as in judgment be best adapt to remedy evil and promote the prosperity of the country nothing have since occur to change view on this important question without repeat the argument contain in former message in favor of discriminate protective duty deem duty to call attention to or other consideration affect this subject the first be the effect of large importation of foreign good upon currency most of the gold of california as fast as be coin find way directly to europe in payment for good purchase in the second place as manufacturing establishment be break down by competition with foreigner the capital invest in be lose thousand of honest and industrious citizen be throw out of employment and the farmer to that extent be deprive of a home market for the sale of surplus produce in the third place the destruction of manufacture leave the foreigner without competition in market and consequently raise the price of the article send here for sale as be now see in the increase cost of iron import from england the prosperity and wealth of every nation must depend upon productive industry the farmer be stimulate to exertion by find a ready market for surplus product and benefit by be able to exchange without loss of time or expense of transportation for the manufacture which comfort or convenience require this be always do to the good advantage where a portion of the community in which live be engage in other pursuit but most manufacture require an amount of capital and a practical skill which can not be command unless be protect for a time from ruinous competition from abroad hence the necessity of lay those duty upon import good which the constitution authorizes for revenue in such a manner as to protect and encourage the labor of own citizen duty however should not be fix at a rate so high as to exclude the foreign article but should be so graduate as to enable the domestic manufacturer fairly to compete with the foreigner in own market and by this competition to reduce the price of the manufacture article to the consumer to the low rate at which can be produce this policy would place the mechanic by the side of the farmer create a mutual interchange of respective commodity and thus stimulate the industry of the whole country and render independent of foreign nation for the supply require by the habit or necessity of the people another question wholly independent of protection present and that is whether the duty levy should be upon the value of the article at the place of shipment or where be practicable a specific duty graduate accord to quantity as ascertain by weight or measure all duty be at present ad valorem a certain percentage be levy on the price of the good at the port of shipment in a foreign country most commercial nation have find indispensable for the purpose of prevent fraud and perjury to make the duty specific whenever the article be of such a uniform value in weight or measure as to justify such a duty legislation should never encourage dishonesty or crime be impossible that the revenue officer at the port where the good be enter and the duty pay should know with certainty what cost in the foreign country yet the law require that should levy the duty accord to such cost be therefore compel to resort to very unsatisfactory evidence to ascertain what that cost be take the invoice of the importer attest by oath as the good evidence of which the nature of the case admit but everyone must see that the invoice may be fabricate and the oath by which be support false by reason of which the dishonest importer pay a part only of the duty which be pay by the honest one and thus indirectly receive from the treasury of the|united|state a reward for fraud and perjury the report of the secretary of the treasury heretofore make on this subject show conclusively that these fraud have be practice to a great extent the tendency be to destroy that high moral character for which merchant have long be distinguish to defraud the government of revenue to break down the honest importer by a dishonest competition and finally to transfer the business of importation to foreign and irresponsible agent to the great detriment of own citizen therefore again most earnestly recommend the adoption of specific duty wherever be practicable or a home valuation to prevent these fraud would also again call attention to the fact that the present tariff in some case impose a high duty upon the raw material import than upon the article manufacture from the consequence of which be that the duty operate to the encouragement of the foreigner and the discouragement of own citizen for full and detailed information in regard to the general condition of indian affair respectfully refer to the report of the secretary of the interior and the accompany document the senate not have think proper to ratify the treaty which have be negotiate with the tribe of indians in california and oregon relation with have be leave in a very unsatisfactory condition in other part of territory particular district of country have be set apart for the exclusive occupation of the indians and right to the land within those limit have be acknowledge and respect but in california and oregon there have be no recognition by the government of the exclusive right of the indians to any part of the country be therefore mere tenant at sufferance and liable to be drive from place to place at the pleasure of the white the treaty which have be reject propose to remedy this evil by allot to the different tribe district of country suitable to habit of life and sufficient for support this provision more than any other be believe lead to rejection and as no substitute for have be adopt by congress have not be deem advisable to attempt to enter into new treaty of a permanent character although no effort have be spare by temporary arrangement to preserve friendly relation with if be the desire of congress to remove from the country altogether or to assign to particular district more remote from the settlement of the white will be proper to set apart by law the territory which be to occupy and to provide the mean necessary for remove to justice alike to own citizen and to the indians require the prompt action of congress on this subject the amendment propose by the senate to the treaty which be negotiate with the|sioux|indians|of|minnesota have be submit to the tribe who be party to and have receive assent a large tract of valuable territory have thus be open for settlement and cultivation and all danger of collision with these powerful and warlike band have be happily remove the removal of the remnant of the tribe of seminole|indians from florida have long be a cherish object of the government and be to which attention have be steadily direct admonish by past experience of the difficulty and cost of the attempt to remove by military force resort have be have to conciliatory measure by the invitation of the commissioner of indian|affairs several of the principal chief recently visit washington and whilst here acknowledge in write the obligation of tribe to remove with the least possible delay late advice from the special agent of the government represent that adhere to promise and that a council of people have be call to make preliminary arrangement a general emigration may therefore be confidently expect at an|early|day the report from the|general|land|office show increase activity in operation the survey of the northern boundary of iowa have be complete with unexampled dispatch within the|last|year 9,522,953|acre of public land have be survey and 8,032,463|acre bring into market acres in the|last|fiscal|year there be sell locate with bounty land warrant locate with other certificate make a total of in addition there were-- report under swamp land grant for internal improvement railroad make an aggregate of be an increase of the amount sell and locate under land warrant of over the|previous|year the whole amount thus sell locate under land warrant report under swamp land grant and select for internal improvement exceed that of the|previous|year by 3,342,372|acre and the sale would without doubt have be much large but for the extensive reservation for railroad in missouri mississippi and alabama acre for the|quarter|ending|30th|september,|1852 there be sell locate with bounty land warrant locate with other certificate report under swamp land grant make an aggregate for the|quarter of much the large portion of the labor of arrange and classify the return of the last census have be finish and will now devolve upon congress to make the necessary provision for the publication of the result in such form as shall be deem best the apportionment of representation on the basis of the new census have be make by the secretary of the interior in conformity with the provision of law relate to that subject and the recent election have be make in accordance with commend to favorable regard the suggestion contain in the report of the secretary of the interior that provision be make by law for the publication and distribution periodically of an analytical digest of all the patent which have be or may hereafter be grant for useful invention and discovery with such description and illustration as may be necessary to present an intelligible view of nature and operation the cost of such publication could easily be defray out of the patent fund and be persuade that could be apply to no object more acceptable to inventor and beneficial to the public at large an appropriation of have be make at the last session for the purchase of a suitable site and for the erection furnish and fit up of an asylum for the insane of the|district|of|columbia and of the army and navy of the|united|state the proper measure have be adopt to carry this beneficent purpose into effect by the late advice from the mexican boundary commission appear that the survey of the river gila from continence with the colorado to suppose intersection with the western line of new|mexico have be complete the survey of the|rio|grande have also be finish from the point agree on by the commissioner as the point where strike the southern boundary of new|mexico to a point below eagle|pass which be about|two third of the distance along the course of the river to mouth the appropriation which be make at the last session of congress for the continuation of the survey be subject to the follow proviso provide that no part of this appropriation shall be use or expend until shall be make satisfactorily to appear to the president of the|united|state that the southern boundary of new|mexico be not establish by the commissioner and surveyor of the united|stat farther north of the town call paso than the same be lay down in disturnell 's map which be add to the treaty attention be draw to this subject by a report from the|department|of|the|interior which review all the fact of the case and submit for decision the question whether under exist circumstance any part of the appropriation could be lawfully use or expend for the further prosecution of the work after a careful consideration of the subject come to the conclusion that could not and so inform the head of that department order be immediately issue by to the commissioner and surveyor to make no further requisition on the department as could not be pay and to discontinue all operation on the southern line of new|mexico but as the department have no exact information as to the amount of provision and money which remain unexpended in the hand of the commissioner and surveyor be leave discretionary with to continue the survey down the|rio|grande as far as the mean at disposal would enable or at once to disband the commission a special messenger have since arrive from the officer in charge of the survey on the river with information that the fund subject to control be exhaust and that the officer and other employ in the service be destitute alike of the mean of prosecute the work and of return to home the object of the proviso be doubtless to arrest the survey of the southern and western line of new|mexico in regard to which different opinion have be express for be hardly to be suppose that there could be any objection to that part of the line which extend along the channel of the|rio|grande but the term of the law be so broad as to forbid the use of any part of the money for the prosecution of the work or even for the payment to the officer and agent of the arrearage of pay which be justly due to earnestly invite prompt attention to this subject and recommend a modification of the term of the proviso so as to enable the department to use as much of the appropriation as will be necessary to discharge the exist obligation of the government and to complete the survey of the|rio|grande to mouth will also be proper to make further provision by law for the fulfillment of treaty with mexico for run and mark the residue of the boundary line between the country permit to invite particular attention to the interest of the|district|of|columbia which be confide by the constitution to peculiar care among the measure which seem to of the great importance to prosperity be the introduction of a copious supply of water into the city of washington and the construction of suitable bridge across the potomac to replace those which be destroy by high water in the early part of the|present|year at the last session of congress an appropriation be make to defray the cost of the survey necessary for determine the good mean of afford an unfailing supply of good and wholesome water some progress have be make in the survey and as soon as be complete the result will be lay before further appropriation will also be necessary for grade and pave the street and avenue and inclose and embellish the public ground within the city of washington commend all these object together with the charitable institution of the district to favorable regard every effort have be make to protect frontier and that of the adjoin mexican states from the incursion of the indian tribe of about|11,000 man of which the army be compose nearly|8,000 be employ in the defense of the newly acquire territory include texas and of emigrant proceed thereto be gratify to say that these effort have be unusually successful with the exception of some partial outbreak in california and oregon and occasional depredation on a portion of the|rio|grande owe be believe to the disturb state of that border region the inroad of the indians have be effectually restrain experience have show however that whenever the race be bring into contact collision will inevitably occur to prevent these collision the|united|state have generally set apart portion of territory for the exclusive occupation of the indian tribe a difficulty occur however in the application of this policy to texas by the term of the compact by which that state be admit into the union retain the ownership of all the vacant land within limit the government of that state be understand have assign no portion of territory to the indians but as fast as settlement advance lay off into county and proceed to survey and sell this policy manifestly tend not only to alarm and irritate the indians but to compel to resort to plunder for subsistence also deprive this government of that influence and control over without which no durable peace can ever exist between and the white trust therefore that a due regard for own interest apart from consideration of humanity and justice will induce that state to assign a small portion of vast domain for the provisional occupancy of the small remnant of tribe within border subject of course to ownership and eventual jurisdiction if should fail to do this the fulfillment of treaty stipulation with mexico and duty to the indians will be fear become a subject of serious embarrassment to the government be hope however that a timely and just provision by texas may avert this evil no appropriation for fortification be make at the last session of congress the cause of this omission be probably to be find in a grow belief that the system of fortification adopt in and heretofore act on require revision the subject certainly deserve full and careful investigation but should not be delay longer than can be avoid in the meantime there be certain work which have be commence some of nearly complete design to protect principal seaport from boston to new|orleans and a few other important point in regard to the necessity for these work be believe that little difference of opinion exist among military man therefore recommend that the appropriation necessary to prosecute be make invite attention to the remark on this subject and on other connect with department contain in the accompanying report of the secretary of war measure have be take to carry into effect the law of the last session make provision for the improvement of certain river and harbor and be believe that the arrangement make for that purpose will combine efficiency with economy owe chiefly to the advanced season when the act be pass little have yet be do in regard to many of the work beyond make the necessary preparation with respect to a few of the improvement the sum already appropriate will suffice to complete but most of will require additional appropriation trust that these appropriation will be make and that this wise and beneficent policy so auspiciously resume will be continue great care should be take however to commence no work which be not of sufficient importance to the commerce of the country to be view as national in character but work which have be commence should not be discontinue until complete as otherwise the sum expend will in most case be lose the report from the|navy|department will inform of the prosperous condition of the branch of the public service commit to charge present to consideration many topic and suggestion of which ask approval exhibit an unusual degree of activity in the operation of the department during the|past|year the preparation for the japan expedition to which have already allude the arrangement make for the exploration and survey of the china seas the|northern|pacific and behrings|strait the incipient measure take toward a reconnoissance of the continent of africa eastward of liberia the preparation for an early examination of the tributary of the river la|plata which a recent decree of the provisional chief of the|argentine|confederation have open to navigation all these enterprise and the mean by which be propose to be accomplish have command full approbation and have no doubt will be productive of most useful result officer of the navy be heretofore instruct to explore the whole extent of the|amazon|river from the confine of peru to mouth the return of of have place in the possession of the government an interesting and valuable account of the character and resource of a country abound in the material of commerce and which if open to the industry of the world will prove an inexhaustible fund of wealth the report of this exploration will be communicate to as soon as be complete among other subject offer to notice by the secretary of the navy select for special commendation in view of connection with the interest of the navy the plan submit by for the establishment of a permanent corps of seaman and the suggestion have present for the reorganization of the|naval|academy in reference to the first of these take occasion to say that think will greatly improve the efficiency of the service and that regard as still more entitled to favor for the salutary influence must exert upon the naval discipline now greatly disturb by the increase spirit of insubordination result from present system the plan propose for the organization of the seamen furnish a judicious substitute for the|law|of|september,|1850 abolish corporal punishment and satisfactorily sustain the policy of that act under condition well adapt to maintain the authority of command and the order and security of ship be believe that any change which propose permanently to dispense with this mode of punishment should be precede by a system of enlistment which shall supply the navy with seamen of the most meritorious class whose good deportment and pride of character may preclude all occasion for a resort to penalty of a harsh or degrade nature the safety of a ship and crew be often dependent upon immediate obedience to a command and the authority to enforce must be equally ready the arrest of a refractory seaman in such moment not only deprive the ship of indispensable aid but impose a necessity for double service on other whose fidelity to duty may be rely upon in such an emergency the exposure to this increase and arduous labor since the passage of the act of have already have to a most observable and injurious extent the effect of prevent the enlistment of the good seamen in the navy the plan now suggest be design to promote a condition of service in which this objection will no longer exist the detail of this plan may be establish in great part if not altogether by the executive under the authority of exist law but have think proper in accordance with the suggestion of the secretary of the navy to submit to approval the establishment of a corps of apprentice for the navy or boy to be enlist until become of age and to be employ under such regulation as the|navy|department may devise as propose in the report cordially approve and commend to consideration and also concur in the suggestion that this system for the early training of seaman may be most usefully ingraft upon the service of merchant marine the other proposition of the report to which have refer the reorganization of the|naval|academy recommend to attention as a project worthy of encouragement and support the valuable service already render by this institution entitle to the continuance of fostering care attention be respectfully call to the report of the|postmaster|general for the detailed operation of department during the|last|fiscal|year from which will be see that the receipt from postage for that time be less by than for the|preceding|fiscal|year be a decrease of about|23|per|cent this diminution be attributable to the reduction in the rate of postage make by the|act|of|march|3,|1851 which reduction take effect at the commencement of the|last|fiscal|year although in operation during the|last|year the act refer to have not fulfil the prediction of friend by increase the correspondence of the country in proportion to the reduction of postage should nevertheless question the policy of return to high rate experience warrant the expectation that as the community become accustomed to cheap postage correspondence will increase be believe that from this cause and from the rapid growth of the country in population and business the receipt of the department must ultimately exceed expense and that the country may safely rely upon the continuance of the present cheap rate of postage in former message have among other thing respectfully recommend to the consideration of congress the propriety and necessity of further legislation for the protection and punishment of foreign consul reside in the|united|state to revive with certain modification the act of 10th march to restrain unlawful military expedition against the inhabitant of conterminous state or territory for the preservation and protection from mutilation or theft of the paper record and archive of the nation for authorize the surplus revenue to be apply to the payment of the public debt in advance of the time when will become due for the establishment of land office for the sale of the public land in california and the|territory|of|oregon for the construction of a road from the|mississippi|valley to for the establishment of a bureau of agriculture for the promotion of that interest perhaps the most important in the country for the prevention of fraud upon the government in application for pension and bounty land for the establishment of a uniform fee bill prescribe a specific compensation for every service require of clerk district attorney and marshal for authorize an additional regiment of mount man for the defense of frontier against the indians and for fulfil treaty stipulation with mexico to defend citizen against the indians with equal diligence and energy as own for determine the relative rank between the naval and civil officer in public ship and between the officer of the army and navy in the various grade of each for reorganize the naval establishment by fix the number of officer in each grade and provide for a retired list upon reduced pay of those unfit for active duty for prescribe and regulate punishment in the navy for the appointment of a commission to revise the public statute of the|united|state by arrange in order supply deficiency correct incongruity simplify language and report to congress for final action and for the establishment of a commission to adjudicate and settle private claim against the|united|state be not aware however that any of these subject have be finally act upon by congress without repeat the reason for legislation on these subject which have be assign in former message respectfully recommend again to favorable consideration think due to the several executive departments of this government to bear testimony to the efficiency and integrity with which be conduct with all the careful superintendence which be possible for the head of those departments to exercise still the due administration and guardianship of the public money must very much depend on the vigilance intelligence and fidelity of the subordinate officer and clerk and especially on those intrust with the settlement and adjustment of claim and account be gratify to believe that have generally perform duty faithfully and well be appoint to guard the approach to the public treasury and occupy position that expose to all the temptation and seduction which the cupidity of peculator and fraudulent claimant can prompt to employ will be but a wise precaution to protect the government against that source of mischief and corruption as far as can be do by the enactment of all proper legal penalty the law in this respect be suppose to be defective and therefore deem duty to call attention to the subject and to recommend that provision be make by law for the punishment not only of those who shall accept bribe but also of those who shall either promise give or offer to give to any of those officer or clerk a bribe or reward touch or relate to any matter of official action or duty have be the uniform policy of this government from foundation to the|present|day to abstain from all interference in the domestic affair of other nation the consequence have be that while the nation of europe have be engage in desolate war country have pursue peaceful course to unexampled prosperity and happiness the war in which have be compel to engage in defense of the right and honor of the country have be fortunately of short duration during the terrific contest of nation against nation which succeed the|french|revolution be enable by the wisdom and firmness of president washington to maintain neutrality while other nation be draw into this wide sweep whirlpool sit quiet and unmoved upon own shore while the flower of numerous army be waste by disease or perish by hundreds|of|thousand upon the battlefield the youth of this favor land be permit to enjoy the blessing of peace beneath the paternal roof while the|states|of|europe incur enormous debt under the burden of which subject still groan and which must absorb no small part of the product of the honest industry of those country for generation to come the|united|state have once be enable to exhibit the proud spectacle of a nation free from public debt and if permit to pursue prosperous way for a|few|year longer in peace may do the same again but be now say by some that this policy must be change europe be no longer separate from by a|voyage|of|month but steam navigation have bring within a|few|day ' sail of shore see more of movement and take a deep interest in controversy although no one propose that should join the fraternity of potentate who have for age lavish the blood and treasure of subject in maintain the balance of power yet be say that ought to interfere between contend sovereign and subject for the purpose of overthrow the monarchy of europe and establish in place republican institution be allege that have heretofore pursue a different course from a sense of weakness but that now conscious strength dictate a change of policy and that be consequently duty to mingle in these contest and aid those who be struggle for liberty this be a most seductive but dangerous appeal to the generous sympathy of freeman enjoying as do the blessing of a free government there be no man who have an american heart that would not rejoice to see these blessing extend to all other nation can not witness the struggle between the oppress and oppressor anywhere without the deep sympathy for the former and the most anxious desire for triumph nevertheless be prudent or be wise to involve in these foreign war be indeed true that have heretofore refrain from do so merely from the degrade motive of a conscious weakness for the honor of the patriot who have go before can not admit man of the revolution who draw the sword against the oppression of the mother country and pledge to heaven life fortune and sacred honor to maintain freedom could never have be actuate by so unworthy a motive know no weakness or fear where right or duty point the way and be a libel upon fair fame for while enjoy the blessing for which so nobly fight and bleed to insinuate the truth be that the course which pursue be dictate by a stern sense of international justice by a statesmanlike prudence and a far see wisdom look not merely to the present necessity but to the permanent safety and interest of the country know that the world be govern less by sympathy than by reason and force that be not possible for this nation to become a propagandist of free principle without array against the combine power of europe and that the result be more likely to be the overthrow of republican liberty here than establishment there history have be write in vain for those who can doubt this france have no sooner establish a republican form of government than manifest a desire to force blessing on all the world own historian inform that hear of some petty act of tyranny in a neighboring principality declare that would afford succor and fraternity to all nation who wish to recover liberty and give in charge to the executive power to give order to the general of the french army to aid all citizen who may have be or should be oppress in the cause of liberty here be the false step which lead to subsequent misfortune soon find involve in war with all the rest of europe in less|than|ten|years government be change from a republic to an empire and finally after shed river of blood foreign power restore exile dynasty and exhaust europe seek peace and repose in the unquestioned ascendency of monarchical principle let learn wisdom from example let remember that revolution do not always establish freedom own free institution be not the offspring of revolution exist before be plant in the free charter of self government under which the english colony grow up and revolution only free from the dominion of a foreign power whose government be at variance with those institution but european nation have have no such training for self government and every effort to establish by bloody revolution have be and must without that preparation continue to be a failure liberty unregulate by law degenerate into anarchy which soon become the most horrid of all despotism policy be wisely to govern and thereby to set such an example of national justice prosperity and true glory as shall teach to all nation the blessing of self government and the unparalleled enterprise and success of a free people live in an age of progress and ours be emphatically a country of progress within the number of states in this union have nearly double the population have almost quadruple and boundary have be extend from the mississippi to the pacific territory be checker over with railroad and furrow with canal the inventive talent of country be excite to the high pitch and the numerous application for patent for valuable improvement distinguish this age and this people from all other the genius of american have enable commerce to move against wind and tide and that of another have annihilate distance in the transmission of intelligence the whole country be full of enterprise common school be diffuse intelligence among the people and industry be fast accumulate the comfort and luxury of life this be in part owe to peculiar position to fertile soil and comparatively sparse population but much of be also owe to the popular institution under which live to the freedom which every man feel to engage in any useful pursuit accord to taste or inclination and to the entire confidence that person and property will be protect by the law but whatever may be the cause of this unparalleled growth in population intelligence and wealth tiring be clear that the government must keep pace with the progress of the people must participate in spirit of enterprise and while exact obedience to the law and restrain all unauthorized invasion of the right of neighboring state should foster and protect home industry and lend powerful strength to the improvement of such mean of intercommunication as be necessary to promote internal commerce and strengthen the tie which bind together as a people be not strange however much may be regret that such an exuberance of enterprise should cause some individual to mistake change for progress and the invasion of the right of other for national prowess and glory the former be constantly agitate for some change in the organic law or urge new and untried theory of human right the latter be ever ready to engage in any wild crusade against a neighboring people regardless of the justice of the enterprise and without look at the fatal consequence to and to the cause of popular government such expedition however be often stimulate by mercenary individual who expect to share the plunder or profit of the enterprise without expose to danger and be lead on by some irresponsible foreigner who abuse the hospitality of own government by seduce the young and ignorant to join in scheme of personal ambition or revenge under the false and delusive pretense of extend the area of freedom these reprehensible aggression but retard the true progress of nation and tarnish fair fame should therefore receive the indignant frown of every good citizen who sincerely love country and take a pride in prosperity and honor constitution though not perfect be doubtless the good that ever be form therefore let every proposition to change be well weighed and if find beneficial cautiously adopt every patriot will rejoice to see authority so exert as to advance the prosperity and honor of the nation whilst will watch with jealousy any attempt to mutilate this charter of liberty or pervert power to act of aggression or injustice thus shall conservatism and progress blend harmonious action in preserve the form and spirit of the constitution and at the same time carry forward the great improvement of the country with a rapidity and energy

peace while spirit go to take station among the great and good man who precede while be customary and proper upon occasion like the present to give a brief sketch of the life of the deceased in the case of mr. clay be less necessary than most other for biography have be write and re - write and read and re - read for the last five|year so that with the exception of a few of the late incident of life all be as well know as can be the short sketch which give be therefore merely to maintain the connection of this discourse henry|clay be bear on the|12th|of|april|1777 in hanover|county virginia of father who die in the|fourth|or|fifth|year of henry 's age little seem to be know except that be a respectable man and a preacher of the baptist persuasion mr. clay 's education to the end of life be comparatively limited say to the end of life because have understand that from time to time add something to education during the great part of whole life mr. clay 's lack of a more perfect early education however may be regret generally teach profitable lesson teach that in this country one can scarcely be so poor but that if will can acquire sufficient education to get through the world respectably in third year mr. clay be licence to practice law and emigrate to lexington kentucky here commence and continue the practice till the|year|1803 when be first elect to the|kentucky|legislature by successive election be continue in the legislature till the latter part of when be elect to fill a vacancy of a single session in the|united|states|senate in be again elect to the|kentucky|house|of|representative and by that body choose speaker in be re - elect to the same body in be again choose to fill a vacancy of two|year in the|united|states|senate in be elect to the|united|state house|of|representatif and on the|first|day of take seat in that body be choose speaker in be again elect speaker early in be the period of last british war mr. clay be send as commissioner with other to negotiate a treaty of peace which treaty be conclude in the latter part of the|same|year on return from europe be again elect to the low branch of congress and on take seat in december|1815 be call to old post the speaker 's chair a position in which be retain by successive election with brief intermission till the inauguration of john|q.|adam in march|1825 be then appoint secretary of state and occupy that important station till the inauguration of gen. jackson in march|1829 after this return to kentucky resume the practice of the law and continue till the|autumn|of|1831 when be by the|legislature|of|kentucky again place in the|united|states|senate by a re - election be continue in the senate till resign seat and retire in march|1842 in december|1849 again take seat in the senate which again resign only|a|few|month before death by the foregoing be perceive that the period from the beginning of mr. clay 's official life in to the end of in be but and that the sum of all the interval in will not amount to ten|year but mere duration of time in office constitute the small part of mr. clay 's history throughout that long period have constantly be the most loved and most implicitly follow by friend and the most dread by opponent of all live american politician in all the great question which have agitate the country and particularly in those great and fearful crisis the missouri question the nullification question and the late slavery question as connect with the newly acquire territory involve and endanger the stability of the union have be the lead and most conspicuous part in be first a candidate for the presidency and be defeat and although be successively defeat for the same office in and in there have never be a moment since till after when a very large portion of the american people do not cling to with an enthusiastic hope and purpose of still elevate to the presidency with other man to be defeat be to be forget but to defeat be but a trifling incident neither change or the world 's estimate of even those of both political party who have be prefer to for the high office have run far briefer course than and leave still shin high in the heaven of the political world jackson van|buren harrison polk and taylor all rise after and set long before the spell the long endure spell with which the soul of man be bind to be a miracle who can compass be probably true owe pre - eminence to no quality but to a fortunate combination of several be surpassingly eloquent but many eloquent man fail utterly and be not as a class generally successful judgment be excellent but many man of good judgment live and die unnoticed will be indomitable but this quality often secure to owner nothing well than a character for useless obstinacy these then be mr. clay 's lead quality no one of be very uncommon but all take together be rarely combine in a single individual and this be probably the reason why such man as henry|clay be so rare in the world mr. clay 's eloquence do not consist as many fine specimen of eloquence do do of type and figure of antithesis and elegant arrangement of word and sentence but rather of that deeply earnest and impassioned tone and manner which can proceed only from great sincerity and a thorough conviction in the speaker of the justice and importance of cause this be that truly touch the chord of human sympathy and those who hear mr. clay never fail to be move by or ever afterwards forget the impression all effort be make for practical effect never speak merely to be hear never deliver a fourth of july oration or an eulogy on an occasion like this as a politician or statesman no one be so habitually careful to avoid all sectional ground whatever do do for the whole country in the construction of measure ever carefully survey every part of the field and duly weigh every conflicting interest feeling as do and as the truth surely be that the world 's good hope depend on the continue union|of|these|state be ever jealous of and watchful for whatever may have the slight tendency to separate mr. clay 's predominant sentiment from first to last be a deep devotion to the cause of human liberty a strong sympathy with the oppress every where and an ardent wish for elevation with this be a primary and all control passion subsidiary to this be the conduct of whole life love country partly because be own country but mostly because be a free country and burn with a zeal for advancement prosperity and glory because see in such the advancement prosperity and glory of human liberty human right and human nature desire the prosperity of countryman partly because be countryman but chiefly to show to the world that freeman could be prosperous that view and measure be always the wise need not to be affirm nor should be on this occasion where so many think differently join in do honor to memory a free people in time of peace and quiet when press by no common danger naturally divide into party at such time the man who be of neither party be not cannot be of any consequence mr. clay therefore be of a party take a prominent part as do in all the great political question of country for the wisdom of course on many be doubt and deny by a large portion of countryman and of such be not now proper to speak particularly but there be many other about course upon which there be little or no disagreement amongst intelligent and patriotic americans of these last be the missouri question nullification and the now recent compromise measure in mr. clay though not unknown be still a young man whether should go to war with great|britain be the question of the|day a minority oppose the declaration of war by congress while the majority though apparently incline to war have for year waver and hesitate to act decisively meanwhile british aggression multiply and grow more daring and aggravate by mr. clay more than any other man the struggle be bring to a decision in congress the question be now fully before congress come up in a variety of way in rapid succession on most of which occasion mr. clay speak add to all the logic of which the subject be susceptible that noble inspiration which come to as come to no other arouse and nerve and inspire friend and confound and bore down all opposition several of speech on these occasion be report and be still extant but the good of these all never be during delivery the reporter forget vocation drop pen and sit enchant from near the beginning to quite the close the speech now live only in the memory of a few old man and the enthusiasm with which cherish recollection of be absolutely astonishing the precise language of this speech shall never know but do know can not help know that with deep pathos plead the cause of the injured sailor that invoke the genius of the revolution that apostrophise the name of otis of henry and of washington that appeal to the interest the pride the honor and the glory of the nation that shame and taunt the timidity of friend that scorn and scout and wither the temerity of domestic foe that beard and defy the|british|lion and rise and swell and madden in course sound the onset till the charge the shock the steady struggle and the glorious victory all pass in vivid review before the entrance hearer important and exciting as be the|war|question of never so alarm the sagacious statesman of the country for the safety of the republic as afterwards do the missouri question this spring from that unfortunate source of discord negro slavery when our|federal|constitution be adopt own no territory beyond the limit or ownership of the state except the territory north west of the|river|ohio and east of the mississippi what have since be form into the|states|of|maine kentucky and tennessee be believe within the limit of or own by massachusetts virginia and north|carolina as to the|north|western|territory provision have be make even before the adoption of the constitution that slavery should never go there on the admission of the states into the union carve from the territory own before the constitution no question or at most no considerable question arise about slavery those which be within the limit of or own by the old state follow respectively the condition of the parent state and those within the north|we territory follow the previously make provision but in purchase louisiana of the french and include with much more what have since be form into the|state of missouri with regard to nothing have be do to forestall the question of slavery when therefore in missouri have form a state constitution without exclude slavery and with slavery already actually exist within limit knock at the door of the union for admission almost the entire representation of the non - slave hold state object a fearful and angry struggle instantly follow this alarmed think man more than any previous question because unlike all the former divide the country by geographical line other question have oppose partizan in all locality of the country and in almost every family so that no division of the union could follow such without a separation of friend to quite as great an extent as that of opponent not so with the missouri question on this a geographical line could be trace which in the main would separate opponent only this be the danger mr. jefferson then in retirement write have for a long time cease to read newspaper or to pay any attention to public affair confident be in good hand and content to be a passenger in bark to the shore from which be not distant but this momentous question like a fire bell in the|night awaken and fill with terror consider at once as the knell of the union be hush indeed for the moment but this be a reprieve only not a final sentence a geographical line co - incide with a marked principle moral and political once conceive and hold up to the angry passion of man will never be obliterate and every irritation will mark deeper and deep can say with conscious truth that there be not a man on earth who would sacrifice more than would to relieve from this heavy reproach in any practicable way the cession of that kind of property for so be misname be a bagatelle which would not cost a second thought if in that way a general emancipation and expatriation could be effect and gradually and with due sacrifice think may be but as be have the wolf by the ear and can neither hold nor safely let go justice be in scale and self preservation in the other mr. clay be in congress and perceive the danger at once engage whole energy to avert begin as have say in and do not terminate till missouri would not yield the point and congress that is a majority in congress by repeat vote show a determination to not admit the state unless should yield after several failure and great labor on the part of mr. clay to so present the question that a majority could consent to the admission be by a vote reject and as all seem to think finally a sullen gloom hang over the nation all feel that the rejection of missouri be equivalent to a dissolution of the union because those state which already have what missouri be reject for refuse to relinquish would go with missouri all deprecate and deplore this but none see how to avert for the judgment of member to be convince of the necessity of yielding be not the whole difficulty each have a constituency to meet and to answer to mr. clay though wear down and exhausted be appeal to by member to renew effort at compromise do so and by some judicious modification of plan couple with laborious effort with individual member and own over master eloquence upon the floor finally secure the admission of the state brightly and captivate as have previously show be now perceive that great eloquence be a mere embellishment or at most but a help hand to inventive genius and devotion to country in of extreme peril after the settlement of the missouri question although a portion of the american people have differ with mr. clay and a majority even appear generally to have be oppose to on question of ordinary administration seem constantly to have be regard by all as the man for a crisis accordingly in the|day of nullification and more recently in the re - appearance of the slavery question connect with territory newly acquire of mexico the task of devise a mode of adjustment seem to have be cast upon mr. clay by common consent and performance of the task in each case be little else than a literal fulfilment of the public expectation mr. clay 's effort in behalf of the|south|american and afterwards in behalf of the greeks in the time of respective struggle for civil liberty be among the fine on record upon the noblest of all theme and bear ample corroboration of what have say be ruling passion a love of liberty and right unselfishly and for own sake have be lead to allude to domestic slavery so frequently already be unwilling to close without refer more particularly to mr. clay 's view and conduct in regard to ever be on principle and in feeling oppose to slavery the very early and of the late public effort of life separate by a period of more|than|fifty|year be both make in favor of gradual emancipation of the slave in kentucky do not perceive that on a question of human right the negro be to be except from the human race and yet mr. clay be the owner of slave cast into life where slavery be already widely spread and deeply seat do not perceive as think no wise man have perceive how could be at once eradicate without produce a great evil even to the cause of human liberty feeling and judgment therefore ever lead to oppose both extreme of opinion on the subject those who would shiver into fragment the|union|of|these|state tear to tatter now venerate constitution and even burn the last copy of the bible rather than slavery should continue a|single|hour together with all more halting sympathiser have receive and be receive just execration and the name and opinion and influence of mr. clay be fully and as trust effectually and enduringly array against but would also if could array name opinion and influence against the opposite extreme against a few but an increase number of man who for the sake of perpetuate slavery be begin to assail and to ridicule the white man 's charter of freedom the declaration that all man be create free and equal so far as have learn the first american of any note to do or attempt this be the late john|c.|calhoun and if mistake not soon after find way into some of the message of however look for and be not much shock by political eccentricity and heresy in south|carolina but only|last|year see with astonishment what purport to be a letter of a very distinguished and influential clergyman of virginia copy with apparent approbation into a st.|louis newspaper contain the following to very extraordinary language--- be fully aware that there be a text in some bible that be not in professional abolitionist have make more use of than of any passage in the bible come however as trace from saint|voltaire and be baptize by thomas|jefferson and since almost universally regard as canonical authority all man be bear free and equal this be a genuine coin in the political currency of generation be sorry to say that have never see man of whom be true but must admit never see the siamese twin and therefore will not dogmatically say that no man ever see a proof of this sage aphorism this sound strangely in republican america the like be not hear in the|fresher|days of the republic let contrast with the language of that truly national man whose life and death now commemorate and lament quote from a speech of mr. clay deliver before the|american|colonization|society in be reproach with do mischief by the agitation of this question the society go into no household to disturb domestic tranquility address to no slave to weaken obligation of obedience seek to affect no man 's property neither have the power nor the will to affect the property of any contrary to consent the execution of scheme would augment instead of diminish the value of the property leave behind the society compose of free man concern only with the free collateral consequence be not responsible for be not this society which have produce the great moral revolution which the age exhibit what would who thus reproach have do if would repress all tendency towards liberty and ultimate emancipation must do more than put down the benevolent effort of this society must go back to the era of liberty and independence and muzzle the cannon which thunder annual joyous return must renew the slave trade with all train of atrocity must suppress the working of british philanthropy seek to meliorate the condition of the unfortunate west|indian slave must arrest the career of south|american deliverance from thraldom must blow out the moral light around and extinguish that great torch of all which america present to a benighted world point the way to right liberty and happiness and when have achieve all those purpose work will be yet incomplete must penetrate the human soul and eradicate the light of reason and the love of liberty then and not till then when universal darkness and despair prevail can perpetuate slavery and repress all sympathy and all humane and benevolent effort among free man in behalf of the unhappy portion of race doom to bondage the|american|colonization|society be organize in mr. clay though not projector be of early member and die as for the|many|preceding|years have be president be of the most cherished object of direct care and consideration and the association of name with have probably be very great collateral support consider no demerit in the society that tend to relieve slave holder from the troublesome presence of the free negro but this be far from be whole merit in estimation in the same speech from which have quote say there be a moral fitness in the idea of return to africa child whose ancestor have be tear from by the ruthless hand of fraud and violence transplant in a foreign land will carry back to native soil the rich fruit of religion civilization law and liberty may not be of the great design of the ruler of the universe whose way be often inscrutable by short sight mortal thus to transform an original crime into a signal blessing to that most unfortunate portion of the globe this suggestion of the possible ultimate redemption of the african race and african continent be make every succeed year have add strength to the hope of realization may indeed be realize pharaoh 's country be curse with plague and host be drown in the|red|sea for strive to retain a captive people who have already serve more than year may like disaster never befall if as the friend of colonization hope the present and come generation of countryman shall by any mean succeed in free land from the dangerous presence of slavery and at the same time in restore a captive people to long lose father land with bright prospect for the future and this too so gradually that neither race nor individual shall have suffer by the change will indeed be a glorious consummation and if to such a consummation the effort of mr. clay shall have contribute will be what most ardently wish and none of labor will have be more valuable to country and kind but henry|clay be dead long and eventful life be close country be prosperous and powerful but could have be quite all have be and be and be to be without henry|clay such a man the time have demand and such in the providence of god be give but be go let strive to deserve as far as mortal may the continue care of divine|providence

peace while spirit go to take station among the great and good man who precede while be customary and proper upon occasion like the present to give a brief sketch of the life of the deceased in the case of mr. clay be less necessary than most other for biography have be write and re - write and read and re - read for the last five|year so that with the exception of a few of the late incident of life all be as well know as can be the short sketch which give be therefore merely to maintain the connection of this discourse henry|clay be bear on the|12th|of|april|1777 in hanover|county virginia of father who die in the|fourth|or|fifth|year of henry 's age little seem to be know except that be a respectable man and a preacher of the baptist persuasion mr. clay 's education to the end of life be comparatively limited say to the end of life because have understand that from time to time add something to education during the great part of whole life mr. clay 's lack of a more perfect early education however may be regret generally teach profitable lesson teach that in this country one can scarcely be so poor but that if will can acquire sufficient education to get through the world respectably in third year mr. clay be licence to practice law and emigrate to lexington kentucky here commence and continue the practice till the|year|1803 when be first elect to the|kentucky|legislature by successive election be continue in the legislature till the latter part of when be elect to fill a vacancy of a single session in the|united|states|senate in be again elect to the|kentucky|house|of|representative and by that body choose speaker in be re - elect to the same body in be again choose to fill a vacancy of two|year in the|united|states|senate in be elect to the|united|state house|of|representatif and on the|first|day of take seat in that body be choose speaker in be again elect speaker early in be the period of last british war mr. clay be send as commissioner with other to negotiate a treaty of peace which treaty be conclude in the latter part of the|same|year on return from europe be again elect to the low branch of congress and on take seat in december|1815 be call to old post the speaker 's chair a position in which be retain by successive election with brief intermission till the inauguration of john|q.|adam in march|1825 be then appoint secretary of state and occupy that important station till the inauguration of gen. jackson in march|1829 after this return to kentucky resume the practice of the law and continue till the|autumn|of|1831 when be by the|legislature|of|kentucky again place in the|united|states|senate by a re - election be continue in the senate till resign seat and retire in march|1842 in december|1849 again take seat in the senate which again resign only|a|few|month before death by the foregoing be perceive that the period from the beginning of mr. clay 's official life in to the end of in be but and that the sum of all the interval in will not amount to ten|year but mere duration of time in office constitute the small part of mr. clay 's history throughout that long period have constantly be the most loved and most implicitly follow by friend and the most dread by opponent of all live american politician in all the great question which have agitate the country and particularly in those great and fearful crisis the missouri question the nullification question and the late slavery question as connect with the newly acquire territory involve and endanger the stability of the union have be the lead and most conspicuous part in be first a candidate for the presidency and be defeat and although be successively defeat for the same office in and in there have never be a moment since till after when a very large portion of the american people do not cling to with an enthusiastic hope and purpose of still elevate to the presidency with other man to be defeat be to be forget but to defeat be but a trifling incident neither change or the world 's estimate of even those of both political party who have be prefer to for the high office have run far briefer course than and leave still shin high in the heaven of the political world jackson van|buren harrison polk and taylor all rise after and set long before the spell the long endure spell with which the soul of man be bind to be a miracle who can compass be probably true owe pre - eminence to no quality but to a fortunate combination of several be surpassingly eloquent but many eloquent man fail utterly and be not as a class generally successful judgment be excellent but many man of good judgment live and die unnoticed will be indomitable but this quality often secure to owner nothing well than a character for useless obstinacy these then be mr. clay 's lead quality no one of be very uncommon but all take together be rarely combine in a single individual and this be probably the reason why such man as henry|clay be so rare in the world mr. clay 's eloquence do not consist as many fine specimen of eloquence do of type and figure of antithesis and elegant arrangement of word and sentence but rather of that deeply earnest and impassioned tone and manner which can proceed only from great sincerity and a thorough conviction in the speaker of the justice and importance of cause this be that truly touch the chord of human sympathy and those who hear mr. clay never fail to be move by or ever afterwards forget the impression all effort be make for practical effect never speak merely to be hear never deliver a fourth of july oration or an eulogy on an occasion like this as a politician or statesman no one be so habitually careful to avoid all sectional ground whatever do do for the whole country in the construction of measure ever carefully survey every part of the field and duly weigh every conflicting interest feeling as do and as the truth surely be that the world 's good hope depend on the continue union|of|these|state be ever jealous of and watchful for whatever may have the slight tendency to separate mr. clay 's predominant sentiment from first to last be a deep devotion to the cause of human liberty a strong sympathy with the oppress every where and an ardent wish for elevation with this be a primary and all control passion subsidiary to this be the conduct of whole life love country partly because be own country but mostly because be a free country and burn with a zeal for advancement prosperity and glory because see in such the advancement prosperity and glory of human liberty human right and human nature desire the prosperity of countryman partly because be countryman but chiefly to show to the world that freeman could be prosperous that view and measure be always the wise need not to be affirm nor should be on this occasion where so many think differently join in do honor to memory a free people in time of peace and quiet when press by no common danger — naturally divide into party at such time the man who be of neither party be not — cannot be of any consequence mr. clay therefore be of a party take a prominent part as do in all the great political question of country for the wisdom of course on many be doubt and deny by a large portion of countryman and of such be not now proper to speak particularly but there be many other about course upon which there be little or no disagreement amongst intelligent and patriotic americans of these last be the missouri question nullification and the now recent compromise measure in mr. clay though not unknown be still a young man whether should go to war with great|britain be the question of the|day a minority oppose the declaration of war by congress while the majority though apparently incline to war have for year waver and hesitate to act decisively meanwhile british aggression multiply and grow more daring and aggravate by mr. clay more than any other man the struggle be bring to a decision in congress the question be now fully before congress come up in a variety of way in rapid succession on most of which occasion mr. clay speak add to all the logic of which the subject be susceptible that noble inspiration which come to as come to no other arouse and nerve and inspire friend and confound and bore down all opposition several of speech on these occasion be report and be still extant but the good of these all never be during delivery the reporter forget vocation drop pen and sit enchant from near the beginning to quite the close the speech now live only in the memory of a few old man and the enthusiasm with which cherish recollection of be absolutely astonishing the precise language of this speech shall never know but do know — can not help know that with deep pathos plead the cause of the injured sailor that invoke the genius of the revolution that apostrophise the name of otis of henry and of washington — that appeal to the interest the pride the honor and the glory of the nation that shame and taunt the timidity of friend that scorn and scout and wither the temerity of domestic foe that beard and defy the|british|lion and rise and swell and madden in course sound the onset till the charge the shock the steady struggle and the glorious victory all pass in vivid review before the entrance hearer important and exciting as be the|war|question of never so alarm the sagacious statesman of the country for the safety of the republic as afterwards do the missouri question this spring from that unfortunate source of discord — negro slavery when our|federal|constitution be adopt own no territory beyond the limit or ownership of the state except the territory north west of the|river|ohio and east of the mississippi what have since be form into the|states|of|maine kentucky and tennessee be believe within the limit of or own by massachusetts virginia and north|carolina as to the|north|western|territory provision have be make even before the adoption of the constitution that slavery should never go there on the admission of the states into the union carve from the territory own before the constitution no question or at most no considerable question arise about slavery those which be within the limit of or own by the old state follow respectively the condition of the parent state and those within the north|we territory follow the previously make provision but in purchase louisiana of the french and include with much more what have since be form into the|state of missouri with regard to nothing have be do to forestall the question of slavery when therefore in missouri have form a state constitution without exclude slavery and with slavery already actually exist within limit knock at the door of the union for admission almost the entire representation of the non - slave hold state object a fearful and angry struggle instantly follow this alarmed think man more than any previous question because unlike all the former divide the country by geographical line other question have oppose partizan in all locality of the country and in almost every family so that no division of the union could follow such without a separation of friend to quite as great an extent as that of opponent not so with the missouri question on this a geographical line could be trace which in the main would separate opponent only this be the danger mr. jefferson then in retirement write have for a long time cease to read newspaper or to pay any attention to public affair confident be in good hand and content to be a passenger in bark to the shore from which be not distant but this momentous question like a fire bell in the|night awaken and fill with terror consider at once as the knell of the union be hush indeed for the moment but this be a reprieve only not a final sentence a geographical line co - incide with a marked principle moral and political once conceive and hold up to the angry passion of man will never be obliterate and every irritation will mark deeper and deep can say with conscious truth that there be not a man on earth who would sacrifice more than would to relieve from this heavy reproach in any practicable way the cession of that kind of property for so be misname be a bagatelle which would not cost a second thought if in that way a general emancipation and expatriation could be effect and gradually and with due sacrifice think may be but as be have the wolf by the ear and can neither hold nor safely let go justice be in scale and self preservation in the other mr. clay be in congress and perceive the danger at once engage whole energy to avert begin as have say in and do not terminate till missouri would not yield the point and congress that is a majority in congress by repeat vote show a determination to not admit the state unless should yield after several failure and great labor on the part of mr. clay to so present the question that a majority could consent to the admission be by a vote reject and as all seem to think finally a sullen gloom hang over the nation all feel that the rejection of missouri be equivalent to a dissolution of the union because those state which already have what missouri be reject for refuse to relinquish would go with missouri all deprecate and deplore this but none see how to avert for the judgment of member to be convince of the necessity of yielding be not the whole difficulty each have a constituency to meet and to answer to mr. clay though wear down and exhausted be appeal to by member to renew effort at compromise do so and by some judicious modification of plan couple with laborious effort with individual member and own over master eloquence upon the floor finally secure the admission of the state brightly and captivate as have previously show be now perceive that great eloquence be a mere embellishment or at most but a help hand to inventive genius and devotion to country in of extreme peril after the settlement of the missouri question although a portion of the american people have differ with mr. clay and a majority even appear generally to have be oppose to on question of ordinary administration seem constantly to have be regard by all as the man for a crisis accordingly in the|day of nullification and more recently in the re - appearance of the slavery question connect with territory newly acquire of mexico the task of devise a mode of adjustment seem to have be cast upon mr. clay by common consent and performance of the task in each case be little else than a literal fulfilment of the public expectation mr. clay 's effort in behalf of the|south|american and afterwards in behalf of the greeks in the time of respective struggle for civil liberty be among the fine on record upon the noblest of all theme and bear ample corroboration of what have say be rule passion a love of liberty and right unselfishly and for own sake have be lead to allude to domestic slavery so frequently already be unwilling to close without refer more particularly to mr. clay 's view and conduct in regard to ever be on principle and in feeling oppose to slavery the very early and of the late public effort of life separate by a period of more|than|fifty|year be both make in favor of gradual emancipation of the slave in kentucky do not perceive that on a question of human right the negro be to be except from the human race and yet mr. clay be the owner of slave cast into life where slavery be already widely spread and deeply seat do not perceive as think no wise man have perceive how could be at once eradicate without produce a great evil even to the cause of human liberty feeling and judgment therefore ever lead to oppose both extreme of opinion on the subject those who would shiver into fragment the|union|of|these|state tear to tatter now venerate constitution and even burn the last copy of the bible rather than slavery should continue a|single|hour together with all more halting sympathiser have receive and be receive just execration and the name and opinion and influence of mr. clay be fully and as trust effectually and enduringly array against but would also if could array name opinion and influence against the opposite extreme — against a few but an increase number of man who for the sake of perpetuate slavery be begin to assail and to ridicule the white man 's charter of freedom the declaration that all man be create free and equal so far as have learn the first american of any note to do or attempt this be the late john|c.|calhoun and if mistake not soon after find way into some of the message of however look for and be not much shock by political eccentricity and heresy in south|carolina but only|last|year see with astonishment what purport to be a letter of a very distinguished and influential clergyman of virginia copy with apparent approbation into a st.|louis newspaper contain the following to very extraordinary language— be fully aware that there be a text in some bible that be not in professional abolitionist have make more use of than of any passage in the bible come however as trace from saint|voltaire and be baptize by thomas|jefferson and since almost universally regard as canonical authority all man be bear free and equal this be a genuine coin in the political currency of generation be sorry to say that have never see man of whom be true but must admit never see the siamese twin and therefore will not dogmatically say that no man ever see a proof of this sage aphorism this sound strangely in republican america the like be not hear in the|fresher|days of the republic let contrast with the language of that truly national man whose life and death now commemorate and lament quote from a speech of mr. clay deliver before the|american|colonization|society in be reproach with do mischief by the agitation of this question the society go into no household to disturb domestic tranquility address to no slave to weaken obligation of obedience seek to affect no man 's property neither have the power nor the will to affect the property of any contrary to consent the execution of scheme would augment instead of diminish the value of the property leave behind the society compose of free man concern only with the free collateral consequence be not responsible for be not this society which have produce the great moral revolution which the age exhibit what would who thus reproach have do if would repress all tendency towards liberty and ultimate emancipation must do more than put down the benevolent effort of this society must go back to the era of liberty and independence and muzzle the cannon which thunder annual joyous return must renew the slave trade with all train of atrocity must suppress the working of british philanthropy seek to meliorate the condition of the unfortunate west|indian slave must arrest the career of south|american deliverance from thraldom must blow out the moral light around and extinguish that great torch of all which america present to a benighted world — point the way to right liberty and happiness and when have achieve all those purpose work will be yet incomplete must penetrate the human soul and eradicate the light of reason and the love of liberty then and not till then when universal darkness and despair prevail can perpetuate slavery and repress all sympathy and all humane and benevolent effort among free man in behalf of the unhappy portion of race doom to bondage the|american|colonization|society be organize in mr. clay though not projector be of early member and die as for the|many|preceding|years have be president be of the most cherished object of direct care and consideration and the association of name with have probably be very great collateral support consider no demerit in the society that tend to relieve slave holder from the troublesome presence of the free negro but this be far from be whole merit in estimation in the same speech from which have quote say there be a moral fitness in the idea of return to africa child whose ancestor have be tear from by the ruthless hand of fraud and violence transplant in a foreign land will carry back to native soil the rich fruit of religion civilization law and liberty may not be of the great design of the ruler of the universe whose way be often inscrutable by short sight mortal thus to transform an original crime into a signal blessing to that most unfortunate portion of the globe this suggestion of the possible ultimate redemption of the african race and african continent be make every succeed year have add strength to the hope of realization may indeed be realize pharaoh 's country be curse with plague and host be drown in the|red|sea for strive to retain a captive people who have already serve more than year may like disaster never befall if as the friend of colonization hope the present and come generation of countryman shall by any mean succeed in free land from the dangerous presence of slavery and at the same time in restore a captive people to long lose father land with bright prospect for the future and this too so gradually that neither race nor individual shall have suffer by the change will indeed be a glorious consummation and if to such a consummation the effort of mr. clay shall have contribute will be what most ardently wish and none of labor will have be more valuable to country and kind but henry|clay be dead long and eventful life be close country be prosperous and powerful but could have be quite all have be and be and be to be without henry|clay such a man the time have demand and such in the providence of god be give but be go let strive to deserve as far as mortal may the continue care of divine|providence trust that in future national emergency will not fail to provide the instrument of safety and security transcript fellow citizens of the senate and of the|house|of|representatives congratulate and common constituency upon the favorable auspex under which meet for first session country be at peace with all the world the agitation which for a time threaten to disturb the fraternal relation which make people be fast subsiding and a|year of general prosperity and health have crown the nation with unusual blessing none can look back to the danger which be pass or forward to the bright prospect before without feel a thrill of gratification at the same time that must be impress with a grateful sense of profound obligation to a beneficent providence whose paternal care be so manifest in the happiness of this highly favor land since the close of the last congress certain cubans and other foreigner resident in the|united|state who be more or less concerned in the previous invasion of cuba instead of be discourage by failure have again abuse the hospitality of this country by make the scene of the equipment of another military expedition against that possession of her|catholic|majesty in which be countenance aid and join by citizen of the|united|state on receive intelligence that such design be entertain lose no time in issue such instruction to the proper officer of the|united|state as seem to be call for by the occasion by the proclamation a copy of which be herewith submit also warn those who may be in danger of be inveigle into this scheme of unlawful character and of the penalty which would incur for some time there be reason to hope that these measure have suffice to prevent any such attempt this hope however prove to be delusive very early|in|the|morning of the of august a steamer call the pampero depart from new|orleans for cuba have on board upward of armed man with evident intention to make war upon the authority of the island this expedition be set on foot in palpable violation of the law of the|united|state leader be a spaniard and several of the chief officer and some other engage in be foreigner the person compose however be mostly citizen of the|united|state before the expedition set out and probably before be organize a slight insurrectionary movement which appear to have be soon suppress have take place in the|eastern|quarter of cuba the importance of this movement be unfortunately so much exaggerated in the account of publish in this country that these adventurer seem to have be lead to believe that the creole population of the island not only desire to throw off the authority of the mother country but have resolve upon that step and have begin a well concert enterprise for effect the person engage in the expedition be generally young and ill informed the steamer in which embark leave new|orleans stealthily and without a clearance after touch at key|west proceed to the coast of cuba and on the|night between the 11th and 12th of august land the person on board at playtas within about|20 league of havana the main body of proceed to and take possession of an inland village league distant leave other to follow in charge of the baggage as soon as the mean of transportation could be obtain the latter have take up line of march to connect with the main body and have proceed league into the country be attack on the|morning|of|the|13th by a body of spanish troop and a bloody conflict ensue after which retreat to the place of disembarkation where about|50 of obtain boat and reembarke therein be however intercept among the key near the shore by a spanish steamer cruising on the coast capture and carry to havana and after be examine before a military court be sentence to be publicly execute and the sentence be carry into effect on the|16th|of|august on receive information of what have occur commodore foxhall|a.|parker be instruct to proceed in the steam frigate saranac to havana and inquire into the charge against the person execute the circumstance under which be take and whatsoever refer to trial and sentence copy of the instruction from the|department|of|state to and of letter to that department be herewith submit accord to the record of the examination the prisoner all admit the offense charge against of be hostile invader of the island at the time of trial and execution the main body of the invader be still in the field make war upon the spanish authority and spanish subject after the lapse of some|day be overcome by the spanish troop disperse on the|24th|of|august lopez leader be capture some day after and execute on the|1st|of|september many of remain follower be kill or die of hunger and fatigue and the rest be make prisoner of these none appear to have be try or execute several of be pardon upon application of friend and other and the rest about|160 in number be send to spain of the final disposition make of these have no official information such be the melancholy result of this illegal and ill fat expedition thus thoughtless young man have be induce by false and fraudulent representation to violate the law of country through rash and unfounded expectation of assist to accomplish political revolution in other state and have lose life in the undertaking too severe a judgment can hardly be pass by the indignant sense of the community upon those who be better inform have yet lead away the ardor of youth and an ill direct love of political liberty the correspondence between this government and that of spain relate to this transaction be herewith communicate although these offender against the law have forfeit the protection of country yet the government may so far as consistent with obligation to other country and fixed purpose to maintain and enforce the law entertain sympathy for unoffende family and friend as well as a feeling of compassion for accordingly no proper effort have be spare and none will be spare to procure the release of such citizen of the|united|state engage in this unlawful enterprise as be now in confinement in spain but be to be hope that such interposition with the government of that country may not be consider as afford any ground of expectation that the|government|of|the|united|state will hereafter feel under any obligation of duty to intercede for the liberation or pardon of such person as be flagrant offender against the law of nation and the law of the|united|state these law must be execute if desire to maintain respectability among the nation of the earth behoove to enforce steadily and sternly the neutrality act pass by congress and to follow as far as may be the violation of those act with condign punishment but what give a peculiar criminality to this invasion of cuba be that under the lead of spanish subject and with the aid of citizen of the|united|state have origin with many in motif of cupidity money be advance by individual probably in considerable amount to purchase cuban bond as have be call issue by lopez sell doubtless at a very large discount and for the payment of which the public land and public property of cuba of whatever kind and the fiscal resource of the people and government of that island from whatever source to be derive be pledge as well as the good faith of the government expect to be establish all these mean of payment be evident be only to be obtain by a process of bloodshed war and revolution none will deny that those who set on foot military expedition against foreign state by mean like these be far more culpable than the ignorant and the necessitous whom induce to go forth as the ostensible party in the proceeding these originator of the invasion of cuba seem to have determine with coolness and system upon an undertaking which should disgrace country violate law and put to hazard the life of ill inform and deluded man will consider whether further legislation be necessary to prevent the perpetration of such offense in future no individual have a right to hazard the peace of the country or to violate law upon vague notion of alter or reform government in other state this principle be not only reasonable in and in accordance with public law but be ingraft into the code of other nation as well as own but while such be the sentiment of this government may be add that every independent nation must be presume to be able to defend possession against unauthorized individual band together to attack the|government|of|the|united|state at all time since establishment have abstain and have seek to restrain the citizen of the country from enter into controversy between other power and to observe all the duty of neutrality at an early period of the government in the|administration|of|washington several law be pass for this purpose the main provision of these law be reenact by the act of april,|1818 by which amongst other thing be declare if any person shall within the territory or jurisdiction of the|united|state begin or set on foot or provide or prepare the mean for any military expedition or enterprise to be carry on from thence against the territory or dominion of any foreign prince or state or of any colony district or people with whom the|united|state be at peace every person so offending shall be deem guilty of a high misdemeanor and shall be fin not exceed and imprison not more|than|three|year and this law have be execute and enforce to the full extent of the power of the government from that|day to this in proclaim and adhere to the doctrine of neutrality and nonintervention the|united|state have not follow the lead of other civilized nation have take the lead and have be follow by other this be admit by of the most eminent of modern british statesman who say in parliament while a minister of the crown that if wish for a guide in a system of neutrality should take that lay down by america in the|days of washington and the secretaryship of jefferson and see in fact that the act of congress of be follow the succeed year by an act of the|parliament|of|england substantially the same in general provision up to that time there have be no similar law in england except certain highly penal statute pass in the reign of george|ii prohibit english subject from enlist in foreign service the avow object of which statute be that foreign army raise for the purpose of restore the house of stuart to the throne should not be strengthen by recruit from england all must see that difficulty may arise in carry the law refer to into execution in a country now have 3,000|or|4,000|mile of seacoast with an infinite number of port and harbor and small inlet from some of which unlawful expeditious may suddenly set forth without the knowledge of government against the possession of foreign state friendly relation with all but entangle alliance with none have long be a maxim with true mission be not to propagate opinion or impose upon other country form of government by artifice or force but to teach by example and show by success moderation and justice the blessing of self government and the advantage of free institution let every people choose for and make and alter political institution to suit own condition and convenience but while avow and maintain this neutral policy be anxious to see the same forbearance on the part of other nation whose form of government be different from own the deep interest which feel in the spread of liberal principle and the establishment of free government and the sympathy with which witness every struggle against oppression forbid that should be indifferent to a case in which the strong arm of a foreign power be invoke to stifle public sentiment and repress the spirit of freedom in any country the government of great|britain and france have issue order to naval commander on the west|india station to prevent by force if necessary the landing of adventurer from any nation on the island of cuba with hostile intent the copy of a memorandum of a conversation on this subject between the charge d'affaire of her|britannic|majesty and the acting secretary of state and of a subsequent note of the former to the|department|of|state be herewith submit together with a copy of a note of the acting secretary of state to the minister of the|french|republic and of the reply of the latter on the same subject these paper will acquaint with the ground of this interposition of lead commercial power of europe and with the apprehension which this government could not fail to entertain that such interposition if carry into effect may lead to abuse in derogation of the maritime right of the|united|state the maritime right of the|united|state be found on a firm secure and well define basis stand upon the ground of national independence and public law and will be maintain in all full and just extent the principle which this government have heretofore solemnly announce still adhere to and will maintain under all circumstance and at all hazard that principle be that in every regularly document merchant vessel the crew who navigate and those on board of will find protection in the flag which be over no american ship can be allow to be visit or search for the purpose of ascertain the character of individual on board nor can there be allow any watch by the vessel of any foreign nation over american vessel on the coast of the|united|state or the sea adjacent thereto will be see by the last communication from the british charge to the|department|of|state that be authorize to assure the secretary of state that every care will be take that in execute the preventive measure against the expedition which the|united|states|government have denounce as not be entitle to the protection of any government no interference shall take place with the lawful commerce of any nation in addition to the correspondence on this subject herewith submit official information have be receive at the|department|of|state of assurance by the|french|government that in the order give to the french naval force be expressly instruct in any operation may engage in to respect the flag of the|united|state wherever may appear and to commit no act of hostility upon any vessel or armament under protection minister and consul of foreign nation be the mean and agent of communication between and those nation and be of the utmost importance that

independence of those island long before the event which have of late impart so much importance to the possession of the|united|state on the pacific acknowledge the independence of the|hawaiian|government this government be first in take that step and several of the lead power of europe immediately follow be influence in this measure by the existing and prospective importance of the island as a place of refuge and refreshment for vessel engage in the whale fishery and by the consideration that lie in the course of the great trade which must at no distant day be carry on between the western coast of north|america and eastern asia be also influence by a desire that those island should not pass under the control of any other great maritime state but should remain in an independent condition and so be accessible and useful to the commerce of all nation need not say that the importance of these consideration have be greatly enhance by the sudden and vast development which the interest of the|united|state have attain in california and oregon and the policy heretofore adopt in regard to those island will be steadily pursue be gratify not only to those who consider the commercial interest of nation but also to all who favor the progress of knowledge and the diffusion of religion to see a community emerge from a savage state and attain such a degree of civilization in those distant sea be much to be deplore that the internal tranquillity of the|mexican|republic should again be seriously disturb for since the peace between that republic and the|united|stat have enjoy such comparative repose that the most favorable anticipation for the future might with a degree of confidence have be indulge these however have be thwart by the recent outbreak in the|state|of|tamaulipas on the right bank of the rio bravo have receive information that person from the|united|state have take part in the insurrection and apprehend that example may be follow by other cause order to be issue for the purpose of prevent any hostile expedition against mexico from be set on foot in violation of the law of the|united|state likewise issue a proclamation upon the subject a copy of which be herewith lay before this appear to be render imperative by the obligation of treaty and the general duty of good neighborhood in last annual message inform congress that citizen of the|united|state have undertake the connection of the ocean by mean of a railroad across the|isthmus|of|tehuantepec under a grant of the|mexican|government to a citizen of that republic and that this enterprise would probably be prosecute with energy whenever mexico should consent to such stipulation with the|government|of|the|united|state as should impart a feeling of security to those who should invest property in the enterprise a convention between the government for the accomplishment of that end have be ratify by this government and only await the decision of the congress and the executive of that republic some unexpected difficulty and delay have arise in the ratification of that convention by mexico but be to be presume that decision will be govern by just and enlighten view as well of the general importance of the object as of own interest and obligation in negotiate upon this important subject this government have have in view and only|one object that object have be and be the construction or attainment of a passage from ocean to ocean the short and the good for traveler and merchandise and equally open to all the world have seek to obtain no territorial acquisition nor any advantage peculiar to and would see with the great regret that mexico should oppose any obstacle to the accomplishment of an enterprise which promise so much convenience to the whole commercial world and such eminent advantage to mexico impress with these sentiment and these conviction the government will continue to exert all proper effort to bring about the necessary arrangement with the|republic|of|mexico for the speedy completion of the work for some|months|past the|republic|of|nicaragua have be the theater of of those civil convulsion from which the cause of free institution and the general prosperity and social progress of the|states|of|central|america have so often and so severely suffer until quiet shall have be restore and a government apparently stable shall have be organize no advance can prudently be make in dispose of the question pende between the country be happy to announce that an interoceanic communication from the mouth of the st. john to the pacific have be so far accomplish as that passenger have actually traverse and merchandise have be transport over and when the canal shall have be complete accord to the original plan the mean of communication will be further improve be understand that a considerable part of the railroad across the|isthmus|of|panama have be complete and that the mail and passenger will in future be convey thereon whichever of the several route between the ocean may ultimately prove most eligible for traveler to and from the different states on the atlantic and gulf of mexico and coast on the pacific there be little reason to doubt that all of will be useful to the public and will liberally reward that individual enterprise by which alone have be or be expect to be carry into effect peace have be conclude between the contend party in the island of st.|domingo and be hope upon a durable basis such be the extent of commercial relation with that island that the|united|states can not fail to feel a strong interest in tranquillity the office of commissioner to china remain unfilled several person have be appoint and the place have be offer to other all of whom have decline acceptance on the ground of the inadequacy of the compensation the annual allowance by law be and there be no provision for any outfit earnestly recommend the consideration of this subject to congress commerce with china be highly important and be become more and more so in consequence of the increase intercourse between port on the|pacific|coast and eastern asia china be understand to be a country in which living be very expensive and know of no reason why the american commissioner send thither should not be place in regard to compensation on an equal footing with minister who represent this country at the|courts|of|europe by reference to the report of the secretary of the treasury will be see that the aggregate receipt for the|last|fiscal|year amount to which with the balance in the treasury on the|1st|july,|1850 give as the available mean for the|year the sum of the total expenditure for the same period be the total import for the|year|ending|june|30,|1851 be of which there be in specie the export for the same period be of which there be of domestic product foreign good reexporte specie since the|1st|of|december last the payment in cash on account of the public debt exclusive of interest have amount to which however include the sum of pay under the twelfth article of the treaty with mexico and the further sum of be the amount of award to american citizen under the late treaty with mexico for which the issue of stock be authorize but which be pay in cash from the treasury the public debt on the 20th ultimo exclusive of the stock authorize to be issue to texas by the|act|of|9th|september,|1850 be the receipt for the|next|fiscal|year be estimate at which with the probable unappropriated balance in the treasury on will give as the probable available mean for that|year the sum of have be deem proper in view of the large expenditure consequent upon the acquisition of territory from mexico that the estimate for the|next|fiscal|year should be lay before congress in such manner as to distinguish the expenditure so require from the otherwise ordinary demand upon the treasury the total expenditure for the|next|fiscal|year be estimate at of which there be require for the ordinary purpose of the government other than those consequent upon the acquisition of new territory and deduct the payment on account of the public debt the sum of and for the purpose connect directly or indirectly with those territory and in the fulfillment of the obligation of the government contract in consequence of acquisition the sum of if the view of the secretary of the treasury in reference to the expenditure require for these territory shall be meet by correspond action on the part of congress and appropriation make in accordance therewith there will be an estimate unappropriated balance in the treasury on the|30th|june,|1853 of wherewith to meet that portion of the public debt due on the|1st|of|july follow amount to as well as any appropriation which may be make beyond the estimate in thus refer to the estimate expenditure on account of newly acquire territory may express the hope that congress will concur with in the desire that a liberal course of policy may be pursue toward and that every obligation express or imply enter into in consequence of acquisition shall be fulfil by the most liberal appropriation for that purpose the value of domestic export for the|last|fiscal|year as compare with those of the|previous|year exhibit an increase of at first view this condition of trade with foreign nation would seem to present the most flattering hope of future prosperity an examination of the detail of export however will show that the increase value of export for the|last|fiscal|year be to be find in the high price of cotton which prevail during the|first|half|of|that|year which price have since decline about|one half the value of export of breadstuff and provision which be suppose the incentive of a low tariff and large importation from abroad would have greatly augment have fall from in to in and to in with a strong probability amount almost to a certainty of a still further reduction in the|current|year the aggregate value of rice export during the|last|fiscal|year as compare with the|previous|year also exhibit a decrease amount to which with a decline in the value of the export of tobacco for the same period make an aggregate decrease in these article of the policy which dictate a low rate of duty on foreign merchandise be think by those who promote and establish would tend to benefit the farm population of this country by increase the demand and raise the price of agricultural product in foreign market the forego fact however seem to show incontestably that no such result have follow the adoption of this policy on the contrary notwithstanding the repeal of the restrictive corn law in england the foreign demand for the product of the american farmer have steadily decline since the short crop and consequent famine in a portion of europe have be happily replace by full crop and comparative abundance of food will be see by recur to the commercial statistic for the|past|year that the value of domestic export have be increase in the single item of raw cotton by over the value of that export for the|year|preceding this be not due to any increase general demand for that article but to the short crop of the|preceding|year which create an increase demand and an augmented price for the crop of last|year should the cotton crop now go forward to market be only equal in quantity to that of the year precede and be sell at the present price then there would be a fall off in the value of export for of at|least|$40,000,000 compare with the amount export for the|year|ending|30th|june,|1851 the production of gold in california for the|past|year seem to promise a large supply of that metal from that|quarter for some time to come this large annual increase of the currency of the world must be attend with usual result these have be already partially disclose in the enhancement of price and a rise spirit of speculation and adventure tend to overtrade as well at home as abroad unless some salutary check shall be give to these tendency be to be fear that importation of foreign good beyond a healthy demand in this country will lead to a sudden drain of the precious metal from bring with as have do in former time the most disastrous consequence to the business and capital of the american people the export of specie to liquidate foreign debt during have be over the amount of specie import the export of specie during the|first|quarter of have be should specie continue to be export at this rate for the remain three|quarters|of|this|year will drain from metallic currency during the enormous amount of in the present prosperous condition of the national finance will become the duty of congress to consider the good mode of pay off the public debt if the present and anticipated surplus in the treasury should not be absorb by appropriation of an extraordinary character this surplus should be employ in such way and under such restriction as congress may enact in extinguish the outstanding debt of the nation by reference to the act of congress approve 9th will be see that in consideration of certain concession by the|state|of|texas be provide the|united|state shall pay to the|state of texas the sum of in a stock bear interest and redeemable at the interest payable half yearly at the treasury of the|united|state in the same section of the law be further provided-- that no|more|than|five|millions of say stock shall be issue until the creditor of the state hold bond and other certificate of stock of texas for which duty on import be specially pledge shall first file at the treasury of the|united|states release of all claim against the|united|state for or on account of say bond or certificate in such form as shall be prescribe by the secretary of the treasury and approve by the president of the|united|state the form of release thus provide for have be prescribe by the secretary of the treasury and approve have be publish in all the lead newspaper in the commercial city of the|united|state and all person hold claim of the kind specify in the forego proviso be require to file release in the form thus prescribe in the treasury of the|united|state on or before the|1st|day|of|october,|1851 although this publication have be continue from the|25th|day|of|march,|1851 yet up to the|1st|of|october last comparatively few release have be file by the creditor of texas the authority of the|state of texas at the request of the secretary of the treasury have furnish a schedule of the public debt of that state create prior to admission into the union with a copy of the law under which each class be contract have from the document furnish by the|state|of|texas determine the class of claim which in judgment fall within the provision of the act of congress of the 9th of september on be officially inform of the acceptance by texas of the proposition contain in the act refer to cause the stock to be prepare and the five|million which be to be issue unconditionally bear an interest of from the|1st|day|of|january,|1851 have be for some time ready to be deliver to the|state of texas the authority of texas up to the present time have not authorize anyone to receive this stock and remain in the treasury|department subject to the order of texas the release require by law to be deposit in the treasury not have be file there the remain five|million have not be issue this last amount of the stock will be withhold from texas until the condition upon which be to be deliver shall be comply with by the creditor of that state unless congress shall otherwise direct by a modification of the law in last annual message to which respectfully refer state briefly the reason which induce to recommend a modification of the present tariff by convert the ad valorem into a specific duty wherever the article import be of such a character as to permit and that such a discrimination should be make in favor of the industrial pursuit of own country as to encourage home production without exclude foreign competition the numerous fraud which continue to be practice upon the revenue by false invoice and undervaluation constitute an unanswerable reason for adopt specific instead of ad valorem duty in all case where the nature of the commodity do not forbid a strike illustration of these fraud will be exhibit in the report of the secretary of the treasury show the custom house valuation of article import under a former law subject to specific duty when there be no inducement to undervaluation and the custom house valuation of the same article under the present system of ad valorem duty so greatly reduce as to leave no doubt of the existence of the most flagrant abuse under the exist law this practical evasion of the present law combine with the languish condition of some of the great interest of the country cause by over importation and consequent depressed price and with the failure in obtain a foreign market for increase surplus of breadstuff and provision have induce again to recommend a modification of the exist tariff the report of the secretary of the interior which accompany this communication will present a condensed statement of the operation of that important department|of|the|government will be see that the cash sale of the public land exceed those of the|preceding|year and that there be reason to anticipate a still further increase notwithstanding the large donation which have be make to many of the states and the liberal grant to individual as a reward for military service this fact furnish very gratifying evidence of the grow wealth and prosperity of country suitable measure have be adopt for commence the survey of the public land in california and oregon survey party have be organize and some progress have be make in establish the principal base and meridian line but further legislation and additional appropriation will be necessary before the proper subdivision can be make and the general land system extend over those remote part of territory on the of march last an act be pass provide for the appointment of commissioner to settle private land claim in california person be immediately appoint all of whom however decline accept the office in consequence of the inadequacy of the compensation other be promptly select who for the same reason also decline and be not until late in the season that the service of suitable person could be secure a majority of the commissioner convene in this city on the|10th|of|september last when detailed instruction be give to in regard to duty first meeting for the transaction of business will be hold in san|francisco on of the present month have think proper to refer to these fact not only to explain the cause of the delay in fill the commission but to call attention to the propriety of increase the compensation of the commissioner the office be of great labor and responsibility and the compensation should be such as to command man of a high order of talent and the most unquestionable integrity the proper disposal of the mineral land of california be a subject surround by great difficulty in last annual message recommend the survey and sale of in small parcel under such restriction as would effectually guard against monopoly and speculation but upon further information and in deference to the opinion of person familiar with the subject be incline to change that recommendation and to advise that be permit to remain as at present a common field open to the enterprise and industry of all citizen until further experience shall have develop the good policy to be ultimately adopt in regard to be safe to suffer the inconvenience that now exist for a short period than by premature legislation to fasten on the country a system found in error which may place the whole subject beyond the future control of congress the agricultural land should however be survey and bring into market with as little delay as possible that the title may become settle and the inhabitant stimulate to make permanent improvement and enter on the ordinary pursuit of life to effect these object be desirable that the necessary provision be make by law for the establishment of land office in california and oregon and for the efficient prosecution of the survey at an|early|day some difficulty have occur in organize the territorial government of new|mexico and utah and when more accurate information shall be obtain of the cause a further communication will be make on that subject in last annual communication to congress recommend the establishment of an agricultural bureau and take this occasion again to invoke favorable consideration of the subject agriculture may justly be regard as the great interest of people fifth of active population be employ in the cultivation of the soil and the rapid expansion of settlement over new territory be daily add to the number of those engage in that vocation justice and sound policy therefore alike require that the government should use all the mean authorize by the constitution to promote the interest and welfare of that important class of fellow citizen and yet be a singular fact that whilst the manufacturing and commercial interest have engage the attention of congress during a large portion of every session and statute abound in provision for protection and encouragement little have yet be do directly for the advancement of agriculture be time that this reproach to legislation should be remove and sincerely hope that the present congress will not close labor without adopt efficient mean to supply the omission of those who have precede an agricultural bureau charge with the duty of collect and disseminate correct information as to the good mode of cultivation and of the most effectual mean of preserve and restore the fertility of the soil and of procure and distribute seed and plant and other vegetable production with instruction in regard to the soil climate and treatment best adapt to growth could not fail to be in the language of washington in last annual message to congress a very cheap instrument of immense national benefit regard the act of congress approve grant bounty land to person who have be engage in the military service of the country as a great measure of national justice and munificence an anxious desire have be feel by the officer intrust with immediate execution to give prompt effect to provision all the mean within control be therefore bring into requisition to expedite the adjudication of claim and be gratify to be able to state that near application have be consider and about|70,000 warrant issue within the short space of nine|months if adequate provision be make by law to carry into effect the recommendation of the department be confidently expect that before the close of the|next|fiscal|year all who be entitle to the benefit of the act will have receive warrant the secretary of the interior have suggest in report various amendment of the law relate to pension and bounty land for the purpose of more effectually guard against abuse and fraud on the government to all of which invite particular attention the large accession to indian population consequent upon the acquisition of new|mexico and california and the extension of settlement into utah and oregon have give increase interest and importance to relation with the aboriginal race no material change have take place within the|last|year in the condition and prospect of the indian tribe who reside in the|northwestern|territory and west of be at peace with all of and will be a source of pleasure to to learn that be gradually advance in civilization and the pursuit of social life along the mexican frontier and in california and oregon there have be occasional manifestation of unfriendly feeling and some depredation commit be satisfied however that result more from the destitute and starve condition of the indians than from any settled hostility toward the white as the settlement of citizen progress toward the game upon which mainly rely for subsistence be drive off or destroy and the only alternative leave to be starvation or plunder become to consider in view of this condition of thing whether justice and humanity as well as an enlighten economy do not require that instead of seek to punish for offense which be the result of own policy toward should not provide for immediate want and encourage to engage in agriculture and to rely on labor instead of the chase for the mean of support various important treaty have be negotiate with different tribe during the|year by which title to large and valuable tract of country have be extinguish all of which will at the proper time be submit to the senate for ratification the joint commission under the treaty of guadalupe|hidalgo have be actively engage in run and mark the boundary line between the|united|state and mexico be state in the last annual report of the secretary of the interior that the initial point on the pacific and the point of junction of the gila with the|colorado|river have be determine and the intervene line about|150|miles in length run and mark by temporary monument since that time a monument of marble have be erect at the initial point and permanent landmark of iron have be place at suitable distance along the line the initial point on the|rio|grande have also be fix by the commissioner at latitude and at the date of the last communication the survey of the line have be make thence westward about|150|miles to the neighborhood of the copper mine the commission on part be at first organize on a scale which experience prove to be unwieldy and attend with unnecessary expense order have therefore be issue for the reduction of the number of person employ within the small limit consistent with the safety of those engage in the service and the prompt and efficient execution of important duty return have be receive from all the officer engage in take the census in the states and territories except california the superintendent employ to make the enumeration in that state have not yet make full report from cause as allege beyond control this failure be much to be regret as have prevent the secretary of the interior from make the decennial apportionment of representatives among the states as require by the act approve may|23,|1850 be hope however that the return will soon be receive and no time will then be lose in make the necessary apportionment and in transmit the certificate require by law the superintendent of the|seventh|census be diligently employ under the direction of the secretary of the interior in classifying and arrange in tabular form all the statistical information derive from the return of the marshal and be believe that when the work shall be complete will exhibit a more perfect view of the population wealth occupation and social condition of a great country than have ever be present to the world the value of such a work as the basis of enlighten legislation can hardly be overestimate and earnestly hope that congress will lose no time in make the appropriation necessary to complete the classification and to publish the result in a style worthy of the subject and of national character the want of a uniform fee bill prescribe the compensation to be allow district attorney clerk marshal and commissioner in civil and criminal case be the cause of much vexation injustice and complaint would recommend a thorough revision of the law on the whole subject and the adoption of a tariff of fee which as far as practicable should be uniform and prescribe a specific compensation for every service which the officer may be require to perform this subject will be fully present in the report of the secretary of the interior in last annual message give briefly reason for believe that possess the constitutional power to improve the harbor of great lakes and seacoast and the navigation of principal river and recommend that appropriation should be make for complete such work as have already be commence and for commence such other as may seem to the wisdom of congress to be of public and general importance without repeat the reason then urge deem duty again to call attention to this important subject the work on many of the harbor be leave in an unfinished state and consequently expose to the action of the element which be fast destroy great number of life and vast amount of property be annually lose for want of safe and convenient harbor on the lakes none but those who have be expose to that dangerous navigation can fully appreciate the importance of this subject the whole northwest appeal to for relief and trust appeal will receive due consideration at hand the same be in a measure true in regard to some of the harbor and inlet on the seacoast the unobstructed navigation of large river be of equal importance settlement be now extend to the source of the great river which empty into and form a part of the mississippi and the value of the public land in those region would be greatly enhance by free the navigation of those water from obstruction in view therefore of this great interest deem duty again to urge upon congress to make such appropriation for these improvement as may deem necessary the survey of the|delta|of|the|mississippi with a view to the prevention of the overflow that have prove so disastrous to that region of country have be nearly complete and the report thereof be now in course of preparation and will shortly be lay before the protection of southwestern frontier and of the adjacent mexican states against the indian tribe within border have claim earnest and constant attention congress have fail at the last session to adopt recommendation that an additional regiment of mount man specially adapt to that service should be raise all that remain to be do be to make the good use of the mean at disposal accordingly all the troop adapt to that service that could properly be spare from other quarter have be concentrate on that frontier and officer of high reputation select to command a new arrangement of the military post have also be make whereby the troop be bring nearer to the mexican frontier and to the tribe be intend to overawe sufficient time have not yet elapse to realize all the benefit that be expect to result from these arrangement but have every reason to hope that will effectually check marauding expedition the nature of the country which furnish little for the support of an army and abound in place of refuge and concealment be remarkably well adapt to this predatory warfare and can scarcely hope that any military force combine with the great vigilance can entirely suppress by the treaty of guadalupe|hidalgo be bind to protect the territory of mexico against the incursion of the savage tribe within border with equal diligence and energy as if the same be make within territory or against citizen have endeavor to comply as far as possible with this provision of the treaty order have be give to the officer command on that frontier to consider the mexican territory and inhabitant as equally with own entitle to protection and to make all plan and arrangement with a view to the attainment of this object instruction have also be give to the indian commissioner and agent among these tribe in all treaty to make the clause design for the protection of own citizen apply also to those of mexico have no reason to doubt that these instruction have be fully carry into effect nevertheless be probable that in spite of all effort some of the neighboring states of mexico may have suffer as own have from depredation by the indians to the difficulty of defend own territory as above mention be superadde in defend that of mexico those that arise from remoteness from the fact that have no right to station troop within limit and that there be no efficient military force on the mexican side to cooperate with own so long as this shall continue to be the case the number and activity of troop will rather increase than diminish the evil as the indians will naturally turn toward that country where encounter the least resistance yet these troop be necessary to subdue and to compel to make and observe treaty until this shall have be do neither country will enjoy any security from attack the indians in california who have previously appear of a peaceable character and dispose to cultivate the friendship of the white have recently commit several act of hostility as a large portion of the reenforcement send to the mexican frontier be draw from the pacific the military force now station there be consider entirely inadequate to defense can not be increase however without an increase of the army and again recommend that measure as indispensable to the protection of the frontier invite attention to the suggestion on this subject and on other connect with department in the report of the secretary of war the appropriation for the support of the army during the|current|fiscal|year|ending|30th|june next be reduce far below the estimate submit by the department the consequence of this reduction be a considerable deficiency to which invite early attention the expenditure of that department for the|year|ending|30th|june|last be the estimate for be show a reduction of the board of commissioner to whom the management of the affair of the military asylum create by the act of march last be intrust have select a site for the establishment of an asylum in the vicinity of this city which have be approve by subject to the production of a satisfactory title the report of the secretary of the navy will exhibit the condition of the public service under the supervision of that department naval force afloat during the|present|year have be actively and usefully employ in give protection to widely extend and increase commerce and interest in the various quarter of the globe and flag have everywhere afford the security and receive the respect inspire by the justice and liberality of intercourse and the dignity and power of the nation the expedition command by lieutenant dispatch in search of the british commander sir john|franklin and companion in the|arctic|sea return to new|york in the|month|of|october after have undergo great peril and suffer from an unknown and dangerous navigation and the rigor of a northern climate without any satisfactory information of the object of search but with new contribution to science and navigation from the unfrequented polar region the officer and man of the expedition have be all volunteer for this service and have so conduct as to meet the entire approbation of the government be suggest as an act of grace and generosity that the same allowance of extra pay and emolument be extend to that be make to the officer and man of like rating in the late explore expedition to the|south|sea earnestly recommend to attention the necessity of reorganize the naval establishment apportion and fix the number of officer in each grade provide some mode of promotion to the high grade of the navy have reference to merit and capacity rather than seniority or date of entry into the service and for retire from the effective list upon reduce pay those who may be incompetent to the performance of active duty as a measure of economy as well as of efficiency in this arm of the service the provision last mention be eminently worthy of consideration the determination of the question of relative rank between the sea officer and civil officer of the navy and between officer of the army and navy in the various grade of each will also merit attention the failure to provide any substitute when corporal punishment be abolish for offense in the

recommendation of the report to favorable consideration the public statute of the|united|state have now be accumulate for more|than|sixty|year and intersperse with private act be scatter through numerous volume and from the cost of the whole have become almost inaccessible to the great mass of the community also exhibit much of the incongruity and imperfection of hasty legislation as seem to be generally concede that there be no common law of the|united|state to supply the defect of legislation be most important that that legislation should be as perfect as possible define every power intend to be confer every crime intend to be make punishable and prescribe the punishment to be inflict in addition to some particular case speak of more at length the whole criminal code be now lamentably defective some offense be imperfectly describe and other be entirely omit so that flagrant crime may be commit with impunity the scale of punishment be not in all case graduate accord to the degree and nature of the offense and be often render more unequal by the different mode of imprisonment or penitentiary confinement in the different states many law of a permanent character have be introduce into appropriation bill and be often difficult to determine whether the particular clause expire with the temporary act of which be a part or continue in force have also frequently happen that enactment and provision of law have be introduce into bill with the title or general subject of which have little or no connection or relation in this mode of legislation so many enactment have be heap upon each other and often with but little consideration that in many instance be difficult to search out and determine what be the law the government of the|united|state be emphatically a government of write law the statute should therefore as far as practicable not only be make accessible to all but be express in language so plain and simple as to be understand by all and arrange in such method as to give perspicuity to every subject many of the states have revise public act with great and manifest benefit and recommend that provision be make by law for the appointment of a commission to revise the public statute of the|united|state arrange in order supply deficiency correct incongruity simplify language and report to congress for action an act of congress approve 30th|september,|1850 contain a provision for the extension of the capitol accord to such plan as may be approve by the president and appropriate to be expend under direction by such architect as should appoint to execute the same on examine the various plan which have be submit by different architect in pursuance of an advertisement by a committee of the senate no one be find to be entirely satisfactory and be therefore deem advisable to combine and adopt the advantage of several the great object to be accomplish be to make such an addition as would afford ample and convenient hall for the deliberation of the houses|of|congress with sufficient accommodation for spectator and suitable apartment for the committee and officer of the branch of the legislature be also desirable not to mar the harmony and beauty of the present structure which as a specimen of architecture be so universally admire keep these object in view conclude to make the addition by wing detach from the present building yet connect with by corridor this mode of enlargement will leave the present capitol uninjure and afford great advantage for ventilation and the admission of light and will enable the work to progress without interrupt the deliberation of congress to carry this plan into effect have appoint an experienced and competent architect the corner stone be lay on the|4th|day|of|july|last with suitable ceremony since which time the work have advance with commendable rapidity and the foundation of both wing be now nearly complete again commend to favorable regard the interest of the|district|of|columbia and deem only necessary to remind that although inhabitant have no voice in the choice of representatives in congress be not the less entitled to a just and liberal consideration in legislation opinion on this subject be more fully express in last annual communication other subject be bring to the attention of congress in last annual message to which would respectfully refer but there be of more than ordinary interest to which again invite special attention allude to the recommendation for the appointment of a commission to settle private claim against the|united|state justice to individual as well as to the government imperatively demand that some more convenient and expeditious mode than an appeal to congress should be adopt be deeply to be regret that in several instance officer of the government in attempt to execute the law for the return of fugitive from labor have be openly resist and effort frustrate and defeat by lawless and violent mob that in case such resistance result in the death of an estimable citizen and in other serious injury ensue to those officer and to individual who be use endeavor to sustain the law prosecution have be institute against the allege offender so far as could be identify and be still pende have regard as duty in these case to give all aid legally in power to the enforcement of the law and shall continue to do so wherever and whenever execution may be resist the act of congress for the return of fugitive from labor be require and demand by the express word of the constitution the constitution declare no person hold to service or labor in state under the law thereof escape into another shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharge from such service or labor but shall be deliver up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due this constitutional provision be equally obligatory upon the legislative the executive and judicial department of the government and upon every citizen of the|united|state congress however must from necessity first act upon the subject by prescribe the proceeding necessary to ascertain that the person be a fugitive and the mean to be use for restoration to the claimant this be do by an act pass during the first term of president washington which be amend by that enact by the last congress and now remain for the executive and judicial department to take care that these law be faithfully execute this injunction of the constitution be as peremptory and as binding as any other stand exactly on the same foundation as that clause which provide for the return of fugitive from justice or that which declare that no bill of attainder or law shall be pass or that which provide for an equality of taxation accord to the census or the clause declare that all duty shall be uniform throughout the|united|state or the important provision that the trial of all crime shall be by jury these several article and clause of the constitution all rest on the same authority must stand or fall together some objection have be urge against the detail of the act for the return of fugitive from labor but be worthy of remark that the main opposition be aim against the constitution and proceed from person and class of person many of whom declare wish to see that constitution overturn avow hostility to any law which shall give full and practical effect to this requirement of the constitution fortunately the number of these person be comparatively small and be believe to be daily diminish but the issue which present be which involve the supremacy and even the existence of the constitution case have heretofore arise in which individual have deny the bind authority of act of congress and even states have propose to nullify such act upon the ground that the constitution be the supreme law of the land and that those act of congress be repugnant to that instrument but nullification be now aim not so much against particular law as be inconsistent with the constitution as against the constitution and be not to be disguise that a spirit exist and have be actively at work to rend asunder this union which be cherished inheritance from revolutionary father in last annual message state that consider the series of measure which have be adopt at the previous session in reference to the agitation grow out of the territorial and slavery question as a final settlement in principle and substance of the dangerous and exciting subject which embrace and recommend adherence to the adjustment establish by those measure until time and experience should demonstrate the necessity of further legislation to guard against evasion or abuse be not induce to make this recommendation because think those measure perfect for no human legislation can be perfect wide difference and jar opinion can only be reconcile by yield something on all side and this result have be reach after an angry conflict of many|months in which part of the country be array against another and violent convulsion seem to be imminent look at the interest of the whole country feel to be duty to seize upon this compromise as the good that could be obtain amid conflict interest and to insist upon as a final settlement to be adhere to by all who value the peace and welfare of the country a year have now elapse since that recommendation be make to that recommendation still adhere and congratulate and the country upon the general acquiescence in these measure of peace which have be exhibit in all part of the republic and not only be there this general acquiescence in these measure but the spirit of conciliation which have be manifest in regard to in all part of the country have remove doubt and uncertainty in the mind of thousand of good man concern the durability of popular institution and give renew assurance that liberty and union may subsist together for the benefit of this and all succeed generation

newspaper contain an affidavit of patrick|riley a deputy marshal for the district of massachusetts set forth the circumstance of the case a copy of which affidavit be herewith communicate private and unofficial communication concur in establish the main fact of this account but no satisfactory official information have as yet be receive and in some important respect the accuracy of the account have be deny by person whom implicate nothing could be more unexpected than that such a gross violation of law such a high handed contempt of the authority of the|united|state should be perpetrate by a band of lawless confederate at noonday in the city of boston and in the very temple of justice regard this flagitious proceeding as be a surprise not unattended by some degree of negligence nor do doubt that if any such act of violence have be apprehend thousand of the good citizen of boston would have present voluntarily and promptly to prevent but the danger do not seem to have be timely make known or duly appreciate by those who be concern in the execution of the process in a community distinguish for love of order and respect for the law among a people whose sentiment be liberty and law and not liberty without law nor above the law such an outrage could only be the result of sudden violence unhappily too much unprepared for to be successfully resist would be melancholy indeed if be oblige to regard this outbreak against the constitutional and legal authority of the government as proceed from the general feeling of the people in a spot which be proverbially call the|cradle|of|american|liberty such undoubtedly be not the fact violate without question the general sentiment of the people of boston and of a vast majority of the whole people of massachusetts as much as violate the law defy the authority of the government and disgrace those concerned in alder and abettor be nevertheless duty to lay before the senate in answer to resolution some important fact and consideration connect with the subject a resolution of congress of september|23,|1789 declare that be recommend to the legislature of the several states to pass law make expressly the duty of the keeper of jail to receive and safe keep therein all prisoner commit under the authority of the|united|state until shall be discharge by the course of the law thereof under the like penalty as in the case of prisoner commit under the authority of such states respectively the|united|state to pay for the use and keeping of such jail at the rate of per month for each prisoner that shall under authority be commit thereto during the time such prisoner shall be therein confine and also to support such of say prisoner as shall be commit for offense a further resolution of congress of the of march provide whereas congress do by a resolution of the|23d|day|of|september,|1789 recommend to the several states to pass law make expressly the duty of the keeper of jail to receive and safe keep therein all prisoner commit under the authority of the|united|states in order therefore to insure the administration of justice-- resolve by the senate and house|of|representatif of in congress assemble that in case any state shall not have comply with the say recommendation the marshal in such state under the direction of the judge of the district be authorize to hire a convenient place to serve as a temporary jail and to make the necessary provision for the safe keeping of prisoner commit under the authority of the|united|state until permanent provision shall be make by law for that purpose and the say marshal shall be allow reasonable expense incur for the above purpose to be pay out of the treasury of the|united|state and a resolution of congress of march|3,|1821 provide where any state or states have comply with the recommendation of congress in the resolution of the|23d|day|of|september,|1789 shall have withdraw or shall hereafter withdraw either in whole or in part the use of jail for prisoner commit under the authority of the|united|state the marshal in such state or states under the direction of the judge of the district shall be and hereby be authorize and require to hire a convenient place to serve as a temporary jail and to make the necessary provision for the safe keeping of prisoner commit under the authority of the|united|state until permanent provision shall be make by law for that purpose and the say marshal shall be allow reasonable expense incur for the above purpose to be pay out of the treasury of the|united|state these various provision of the law remain unrepealed by the law of massachusetts as that law stand before the act of the legislature of that state of the 24th of march the common jail in the respective county be to be use for the detention of any person detain or commit by the authority of the court of the|united|state as well as by the court and magistrate of the state but these provision be abrogate and repeal by the act of the legislature of massachusetts of the|24th|of|march,|1843 that act declare no judge of any court of record of this commonwealth and no justice of the peace shall hereafter take cognizance or grant a certificate in case that may arise under the third section of an act of congress pass february|12,|1793 and entitle an act respect fugitive from justice and person escape from the service of master to any person who claim any other person as a fugitive slave within the jurisdiction of the commonwealth and further declare no sheriff deputy sheriff coroner constable jailer or other officer of this commonwealth shall hereafter arrest or detain or aid in the arrest or detention or imprisonment in any jail or other building belong to this commonwealth or to any county city or town thereof of any person for the reason that be claim as a fugitive slave and further declare any justice of the peace sheriff deputy sheriff coroner constable or jailer who shall offend against the provision of this law by in any way act directly or indirectly under the power confer by the third section of the act of congress aforementione shall forfeit a sum not exceed for every such offense to the use of the county where say offense be commit or shall be subject to imprisonment not exceed one|year in the county jail this law be obvious have object the first be to make a penal offense in all officer and magistrate of the commonwealth to exercise the power confer on by the act of congress of the|12th|of|february,|1793 entitle an act respect fugitive from justice and person escape from the service of master and which power be fully competent to perform up to the time of this inhibition and penal enactment to refuse the use of the jail of the state for the detention of any person claim as a fugitive slave be deeply to be lament that the purpose of these enactment be quite apparent be to prevent as far as the legislature of the state could prevent the law of congress pass for the purpose of carry into effect that article of the|united|state which declare that no person hold to service or labor in state under the law thereof escape into another shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharge from such service or labor but shall be deliver up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due from be carry into effect but these act of state legislation although may cause embarrassment and create expense can not derogate either from the duty or the authority of congress to carry out fully and fairly the plain and imperative constitutional provision for the delivery of person bind to labor in state and escape into another to the party to whom such labor may be due be quite clear that by the resolution of congress of march|3,|1821 the marshal of the|united|state in any state in which the use of the jail of the state have be withdraw in whole or in part from the purpose of the detention of person commit under the authority of the|united|state be not only empower but expressly require under the direction of the judge of the district to hire a convenient place for the safe keeping of prisoner commit under authority of the|united|state will be see from paper accompany this communication that the attention of the marshal of massachusetts be distinctly call to this provision of the law by a letter from the secretary of the navy of the date of october|28|last there be no official information that the marshal have provide any such place for the confinement of prisoner if have not be to be regret that this power be not exercise by the marshal under the direction of the district judge immediately on the passage of the act of the legislature of massachusetts of the|24th|of|march,|1843 and especially that be not exercise on the passage of the fugitive slave law of the last session or when the attention of the marshal be afterwards particularly draw to be true that the escape from the deputy marshal in this case be not owe to the want of a prison or place of confinement but still be not easy to see how the prisoner could have be safely and conveniently detain during an adjournment of the hearing for some|day without such place of confinement if shall appear that no such place have be obtain direction to the marshal will be give to lose no time in the discharge of this duty transmit to the senate the copy of a proclamation issue by on the|18th instant in relation to these unexpected and deplorable occurrence in boston together with copy of instruction from the departments of war and navy relative to the general subject and communicate also copy of telegraphic dispatch transmit from the|department|of|state to the district attorney and marshal of the|united|state for the district of massachusetts and answer thereto in regard to the last branch of the inquiry make by the resolution of the senate have to observe that the constitution declare that the president shall take care that the law be faithfully execute and that shall be commander in chief of the army and navy of the|united|state and of the militia of the several states when call into the actual service of the|united|state and that congress shall have power to provide for call forth the militia to execute the law of the union suppress insurrection and repel invasion from which appear that the army and navy be by the constitution place under the control of the executive and probably no legislation of congress could add to or diminish the power thus give but by increase or diminish or abolish altogether the army and navy but not so with the militia the president can not call the militia into service even to execute the law or repel invasion but by the authority of act of congress pass for that purpose but when the militia be call into service in the manner prescribe by law then the constitution give the command to the president act on this principle congress by the act of february|28,|1795 authorize the president to call forth the militia to repel invasion and suppress insurrection against a state government and to suppress combination against the law of the|united|state and cause the law to be faithfully execute but the act proceed to declare that whenever may be necessary in the judgment of the president to use the military force thereby direct to be call forth the president shall forthwith by proclamation command such insurgent to disperse and retire peaceably to respective abode within a limited time these word be broad enough to require a proclamation in all case where militia be call out under that act whether to repel invasion or suppress an insurrection or to aid in execute the law this section have consequently create some doubt whether the militia could be call forth to aid in execute the law without a previous proclamation but yet the proclamation seem to be in word direct only against insurgent and to require to disperse thereby imply not only an insurrection but an organized or at least an embodied force such a proclamation in aid of the civil authority would often defeat the whole object by give such notice to person intend to be arrest that would be enable to fly or secrete the force may be want sometimes to make the arrest and also sometimes to protect the officer after be make and to prevent a rescue would therefore suggest that this section be modify by declare that nothing therein contain shall be construe to require any previous proclamation when the militia be call forth either to repel invasion to execute the law or suppress combination against and that the president may make such call and place such militia under the control of any civil officer of the|united|state to aid in execute the law or suppress such combination and while so employed shall be pay by and subsist at the expense of the|united|state congress not probably advert to the difference between the militia and the|regular|army by authorize the president to use the land and naval force of the|united|state for the same purpose for which may call forth the militia and subject to the same proclamation but the power of the president under the constitution as commander of the army and navy be general and duty to see the law faithfully execute be general and positive and the act of ought not to be construe as evince any disposition in congress to limit or restrain this constitutional authority for great certainty however may be well that congress should modify or explain this act in regard to provision for the employment of the army and navy of the|united|state as well as that in regard to call forth the militia be suppose not to be doubtful that all citizen whether enrol in the militia or not may be summon as member of the posse comitatus either by the marshal or a commissioner accord to law and that be duty to obey such summon but perhaps may be doubt whether the marshal or a commissioner can summon as the posse comitatus an organized militia force act under own appropriate officer without the consent of such officer this point may deserve the consideration of congress use this occasion to repeat the assurance that so far as depend on the law shall be faithfully execute and all forcible opposition to suppress and to this end be prepared to exercise whenever may become necessary the power constitutionally vest in to the full extent be fully persuade that the great majority of the people of this country be warmly and strongly attach to the constitution the preservation of the union the just support of the government and the maintenance of the authority of law be persuade that earnest wish and the line of constitutional duty entirely concur and doubt not firmness moderation and prudence strengthen and animate by the general opinion of the people will prevent the repetition of occurrence disturb the public peace and reprobate by all good man april|25 1851-

have undertake the connection of thetwo ocean by mean of a railroad across the|isthmus|of|tehuantepec undergrant of the|mexican|government to a citizen of that republic be understoodthat a thorough survey of the course of the communication be in preparation and there be every reason to expect that will be prosecute with characteristicenergy especially when that government shall have consent to such stipulationswith the|united|state as may be necessary to imparta feeling of security to those who may embark property in the enterprise negotiation be pende for the accomplishment of that object and a hopeis confidently entertain that when the government|of|mexico shall becomeduly sensible of the advantage which that country can not fail to derivefrom the work and learn that the|government|of|the|united|state desiresthat the right of sovereignty of mexico in the isthmus shall remain unimpaired the stipulation refer to will be agree to with alacrity by the last advice from mexico would appear however that thatgovernment entertain strong objection to some of the stipulation whichthe party concern in the project of the railroad deem necessary fortheir protection and

all the mean properly in power for the purpose of cause thatarticle to be import into the country at a reasonable price nothingwill be omit on part toward accomplish this desirable end ampersuade that in remove any restraint on this traffic the peruviangovernment will promote own good interest while will afford aproof of a friendly disposition toward this country which will be dulyappreciate the treaty between the|united|state and majesty the|king|of|thehawaiian|islands which have recently be make public will be believe have a beneficial effect upon the relation between the country the relation between those part of the island of st.|domingo whichwere formerly colony of spain and france respectively be still inan unsettled condition the proximity of that island to the|united|statesand the delicate question involve in the exist controversy there renderit desirable that should be permanently and speedily adjust the interestsof humanity and of general commerce also demand this and as intimationsof the same sentiment have be receive from other government ishope that some plan may soon be devise to effect the object in a mannerlikely to give general satisfaction the|government|of|the|united|stateswill not fail by the exercise of all proper friendly office to do allin power to put an end to the destructive war which have rage betweenthe different part of the island and to secure to both the benefitsof peace and commerce refer to the report of the secretary of the treasury for a detailedstatement of the finance the total receipt into the treasury for the|year|ending|30th of junelast be the total expenditure during the same periodwere the public debt have be reduce since the last annualreport from the treasury|department by the nineteenth section of the proceedsof the sale of the public land be pledge for the interest and principalof the public debt the great amount of those land subsequently grantedby congress for military bounty will be believe very nearly supplythe public demand for several|year to come and but little reliance can therefore be place on that hitherto fruitful source of revenue asidefrom the permanent annual expenditure which have necessarily largelyincrease a portion of the public debt amount to mustbe provide for within the|next|two|fiscal|year be most desirablethat these accrue demand should be meet without resort to new loan all experience have demonstrate the wisdom and policy of raise a largeportion of revenue for the support of government from duty on good import the power to lay these duty be unquestionable and chief object of course be to replenish the treasury but if in do this an incidentaladvantage may be gain by encourage the industry of own citizen be duty to avail of that advantage a duty lay upon an article which can not be produce in this country such as tea or coffee add to the cost of the article and be chieflyor wholly pay by the consumer but a duty lay upon an article which maybe produce here stimulate the skill and industry of own country toproduce the same article which be bring into the market in competitionwith the foreign article and the importer be thus compel to reducehis price to that at which the domestic article can be sell thereby throwinga part of the duty upon the producer of the foreign article the continuanceof this process create the skill and invite the capital which finallyenable to produce the article much cheap than could have be procuredfrom abroad thereby benefit both the producer and the consumer at home the consequence of this be that the artisan and the agriculturist be broughttogether each afford a ready market for the produce of the other thewhole country become prosperous and the ability to produce every necessaryof life render independent in war as well as in peace a high tariff can never be permanent will cause dissatisfaction and will be change exclude competition and thereby invite the investmentof capital in manufacture to such excess that when change bring distress bankruptcy and ruin upon all who have be mislead by faithless protection what the manufacturer want be uniformity and permanency that may feela confidence that be not to be ruin by sudden exchange but to makea tariff uniform and permanent be not only necessary that the law shouldnot be alter but that the duty should not fluctuate to effect thisall duty should be specific wherever the nature of the article be sucha to admit of ad valorem duty fluctuate with the price and offerstrong temptation to fraud and perjury specific duty on the contrary be equal and uniform in all port and at all time and offer a stronginducement to the importer to bring the good article as pay no moreduty upon that than upon of inferior quality therefore stronglyrecommend a modification of the present tariff which have prostrate someof most important and necessary manufacture and that specific dutiesbe impose sufficient to raise the requisite revenue make such discriminationsin favor of the industrial pursuit of own country as to encouragehome production without exclude foreign competition be also importantthat an unfortunate provision in the present tariff which impose a muchhigher duty upon the raw material that enter into manufacture thanupon the manufacture article should be remedie the paper accompany the report of the secretary of the treasurywill disclose fraud attempt upon the revenue in variety and amountso great as to justify the conclusion that be impossible under any systemof ad valorem duty levy upon the foreign cost or value of the articleto secure an honest observance and an effectual administration of the law the fraudulent device to evade the law which have be detect by thevigilance of the appraiser leave no room to doubt that similar impositionsnot discover to a large amount have be successfully practice sincethe enactment of the law now in force this state of thing have alreadyhad a prejudicial influence upon those engage in foreign commerce ithas a tendency to drive the honest trader from the business of importingand to throw that important branch of employment into the hand of unscrupulousand dishonest man who be alike regardless of law and the obligationsof an oath by these mean the plain intention of congress as expressedin the law be daily defeat every motive of policy and duty therefore impel to ask the earnest attention of congress to this subject ifcongress should deem unwise to attempt any important change in thesystem of levy duty at this session will become indispensableto the protection of the revenue that such remedy as in the judgmentof congress may mitigate the evil complain of should be at once apply as before state specific duty would in opinion afford the mostperfect remedy for this evil but if should not concur in this view then as a partial remedy beg leave respectfully to recommend that insteadof take the invoice of the article abroad as a means of determine itsvalue here the correctness of which invoice be in many case impossibleto verify the law be so change as to require a home valuation or appraisal to be regulate in such manner as to give as far as practicable uniformityin the several port there be no mint in california be inform that the laborer inthe mine be compel to dispose of gold dust at a large discount this appear to to be a heavy and unjust tax upon the labor of thoseemploye in extract this precious metal and doubt not will bedispose at the early period possible to relieve from by theestablishment of a mint in the meantime as an assayer 's office be establishedthere would respectfully submit for consideration the proprietyof authorize gold bullion which have be assay and stamp to be receivedin payment of government due can not conceive that the treasury wouldsuffer any loss by such a provision which will at once raise bullion toit par value and thereby save if be rightly inform many millionsof dollar to the laborer which be now pay in brokerage to convert thisprecious metal into available fund this discount upon hard earningsis a heavy tax and every effort should be make by the government to relievethem from so great a burden more|than|three fourth of population be engage in the cultivationof the soil the commercial manufacturing and navigating interest areall to a great extent dependent on the agricultural be therefore themost important interest of the nation and have a just claim to the fosteringcare and protection of the government so far as can be extend consistentlywith the provision of the constitution as this can not be do by theordinary mode of legislation respectfully recommend the establishmentof an agricultural bureau to be charge with the duty of give to thisleade branch of american industry the encouragement which so welldeserve in view of the immense mineral resource of country provisionshould also be make for the employment of a competent mineralogist andchemist who should be require under the direction of the head of thebureau to collect specimen of the various mineral of country andto ascertain by careful analysis respective element and propertiesand adaptation to useful purpose should also be require toexamine and report upon the quality of different soil and the manuresb calculate to improve productiveness by publish the resultsof such experiment with suitable explanation and by the collectionand distribution of rare seed and plant with instruction as to thebest system of cultivation much may be do to promote this great nationalinterest in compliance with the act of congress pass on the|23d|of|may among other thing for take the|seventh|census a superintendentwas appoint and all other measure adopt which be deem necessaryto insure the prompt and faithful performance of that duty the appropriationalready make will be believe be sufficient to defray the whole expenseof the work but further legislation may be necessary in regard to thecompensation of some of the marshal of the territories will also beproper to make provision by law at an|early|day for the publication ofsuch abstract of the return as the public interest may require the unprecedented growth of territory on the pacific in wealthand population and the consequent increase of social and commercialrelation with the|atlantic|state seem to render the duty of the governmentto use all constitutional power to improve the mean of intercoursewith the importance of open a line of communication the bestand most expeditious of which the nature of the country will admit betweenthe valley of the mississippi and the pacific be bring to noticeby predecessor in annual message and as the reason which presentedin favor of the measure still exist in full force beg leave to callyour attention to and to repeat the recommendation then make by the uncertainty which exist in regard to the validity of land titlesin california be a subject which demand early consideration largebodie of land in that state be claim under grant say to have beenmade by authority of the spanish and mexican government many of thesehave not be perfect other have be revoke and some be believedto be fraudulent but until shall have be judicially investigatedthey will continue to retard the settlement and improvement of the country therefore respectfully recommend that provision be make by law for theappointment of commissioner to examine all such claim with a view totheir final adjustment also beg leave to call attention to the propriety of extendingat an early|day system of land law with such modification as maybe necessary over the state of california and the|territories|of|utahand new mexico the mineral land of california will of course form anexception to any general system which may be adopt various method ofdispose of have be suggest be at first incline to favorthe system of leasing as seem to promise the large revenue to thegovernment and to afford the good security against monopoly but furtherreflection and experience in lease the lead mine and sell landsupon credit have bring mind to the conclusion that there would begreat difficulty in collect the rent and that the relation of debtorand creditor between the citizen and the government would be attendedwith many mischievous consequence therefore recommend that insteadof retain the mineral land under the permanent control of the governmentthey be divide into small parcel and sell under such restriction asto quantity and time as will insure the good price and guard most effectuallyagainst combination of capitalist to obtain monopoly the annexation of texas and the acquisition of california and new|mexicohave give increase importance to indian relation the various tribesbrought under jurisdiction by these enlargement of boundariesare estimate to embrace a population of texas and new|mexicoare surround by powerful tribe of indians who be a source of

stationedin that country although form a large proportion of the army be representeda entirely inadequate to own protection and the fulfillment of ourtreaty stipulation with mexico the principal deficiency be in cavalry and recommend that congress should at as early a period as practicable provide for the raising of or more regiment of mount man for further suggestion on this subject and other connect with ourdomestic interest and the defense of frontier refer to thereport of the secretary of the interior and of the secretary of war commend also to favorable consideration the suggestion containedin the last mention report and in the letter of to the establishment of an asylum for the relief of disabled anddestitute soldier this subject appeal so strongly to sympathiesthat would be superfluous in to say anything more than barely toexpress cordial approbation of the propose object the navy continue to give protection to commerce and other nationalinterest in the different quarter of the globe and with the exceptionof a single steamer on the northern lake the vessel in commission aredistribute in different squadron the report of the head of that department will exhibit the servicesof these squadron and of the several vessel employ in each during thepast year be a source of gratification that while have be constantlyprepare for any hostile emergency have everywhere meet with the respectand courtesy due as well to the dignity as to the peaceful dispositionsand just purpose of the nation the brigantine accept by the government from a generous citizenof new|york and place under the command of an officer of the navy to proceedto the|arctic|sea in quest of the british commander sir john|franklinand companion in compliance with the act of congress approve inmay last have when last hear from penetrate into a high northern latitude;but the success of this noble and humane enterprise be yet uncertain invite attention to the view of present naval establishmentand resource present in the report of the secretary of the navy andthe suggestion therein make for improvement together with the navalpolicy recommend for the security of pacific|coast and the protectionand extension of commerce with eastern asia facility for a largerparticipation in the trade of the east by mean of recent settlementson the shore of the pacific be too obvious to be overlook or disregard the question in relation to rank in the army and navy and relativerank between officer of the branch of the service present tothe executive by certain resolution of the|house|of|representative atthe last session of congress have be submit to a board of officersin each branch of the service and report may be expect at an earlyday also earnestly recommend the enactment of a law authorize officersof the army and navy to be retire from the service when incompetent forit vigorous and active duty take care to make suitable provisionfor those who have faithfully serve country and award distinctionsby retain in appropriate command those who have be particularly conspicuousfor gallantry and good conduct while the obligation of the country tomaintain and honor those who to the exclusion of other pursuit havedevote to arduous service be acknowledge this obligationshould not be permit to interfere with the efficiency of the serviceitself be gratify in be able to state that the estimate of expenditurefor the navy in the|ensuing|year be less by more|than|$1,000,000 thanthose of the present except the appropriation which may become necessaryfor the construction of a dock on the coast of the pacific propositionsfor which be now be consider and on which a special report may beexpecte early in present session there be an evident justness in the suggestion of the same report thatappropriation for the naval service proper should be separate from thosefor fix and permanent object such as build dock and navy yardsand the fixture attach and from the extraordinary object under thecare of the department which however important be not essentially naval a revision of the code for the government of the navy seem to requirethe immediate consideration of congress system of crime and punishmentshad undergone no change for half|a|century until the last session thoughit defect have be often and ably point out and the abolition ofa particular specie of corporal punishment which then take place withoutprovide any substitute have leave the service in a state of defectivenesswhich call for prompt correction therefore recommend that the wholesubject be revise without delay and such a system establish for theenforcement of discipline as shall be at once humane and effectual the accompanying report of the postmaster general present a satisfactoryview of the operation and condition of that department at the close ofthe|last|fiscal|year the length of the inland mail route in the unitedstates not embrace the service in oregon and california be the annual transportation thereon 46,541,423|mile and the annualcost of such transportation the increase of the annual transportationover that of the|preceding|year be 3,997,354|mile and the increase incost be the number of post - office in the|united|state on the1st day of july last be be an increase of during theprecede year the gross revenue of the|department|for|the|fiscal year end june30 amount to include the annual appropriationof for the franked matter of the departments and exclude theforeign postage collect for and payable to the|british|government the expenditure for the same period be leave a balanceof revenue over expenditure of be happy to find that the fiscal condition of the department be sucha to justify the postmaster general in recommend the reduction of ourinland letter postage to 3|cent the single letter when prepay and centswhen not prepay also recommend that the prepay rate shall be reducedto whenever the revenue of the department after the reduction shall exceed expenditure by more|than per cent for consecutiveyear that the postage upon california and other letter send by oceansteamer shall be much reduce and that the rate of postage on newspaper pamphlet periodical and other print matter shall be modify andsome reduction thereon make can not be doubt that the propose reduction will for the presentdiminish the revenue of the department be believe that the deficiency after the surplus already accumulate shall be exhaust may be almostwholly meet either by abolish the exist privilege of send freematter through the mail or by pay out of the treasury to the|post officedepartment a sum equivalent to the postage of which be deprive by suchprivilege the last be suppose to be the preferable mode and will ifnot entirely so nearly supply that deficiency as to make any further appropriationthat may be find necessary so inconsiderable as to form no obstacle tothe propose reduction entertain no doubt of the authority of congress to make appropriationsfor lead object in that class of public work comprise what be usuallycalle work of internal improvement this authority suppose to be derivedchiefly from the power of regulate commerce with foreign nation andamong the states and the power of lay and collect impost wherecommerce be to be carry on and impost collect there must be portsand harbor as well as wharf and custom house if ship laden with valuablecargoe approach the shore or sail along the coast light house be necessaryat suitable point for the protection of life and property other facilitiesand security for commerce and navigation be hardly less important andthose clause of the constitution therefore to which have referredhave receive from the origin of the government a liberal and beneficialconstruction not only have light house buoy and beacon be establishedand float light maintain but harbor have be clear and improve pier construct and even breakwater for the safety of ship andsea wall to protect harbor from be fill up and render uselessby the action of the ocean have be erect at very great expense andthis construction of the constitution appear the more reasonable fromthe consideration that if these work of such evident importance and utility be not to be accomplish by congress can not be accomplish atall by the adoption of the constitution the several states voluntarilyparte with the power of collect duty of impost in own port and be not to be expect that should raise money by internal taxation direct or indirect for the benefit of that commerce the revenue derivedfrom which do not either in whole or in part go into own treasury nor do perceive any difference between the power of congress to makeappropriation for object of this kind on the ocean and the power to makeappropriation for similar object on lake and river wherever arelarge enough to bear on water an extensive traffic the magnificentmississippi and tributary and the vast lake of the north and northwestappear to to fall within the exercise of the power as justly and asclearly as the ocean and be a mistake to regardexpenditure judiciously make for these object as expenditure for localpurpose the position or sight of the work be necessarily local but itsutility be general a ship canal around the|falls|of|st.|mary of less thana mile in length though local in construction would yet be nationalin purpose and benefit as would remove the only obstructionto a navigation of more|than|1,000|mile affect several states aswell as commercial relation with canada so too the breakwater atthe mouth of the delaware be erect not for the exclusive benefit ofthe states border on the bay and river of that name but for that ofthe whole coastwise navigation of the|united|state and to a considerableextent also of foreign commerce if a ship be lose on the bar at the entranceof a southern port for want of sufficient depth of water be very likelyto be a northern ship and if a steamboat be sink in any part of the mississippion account of channel not have be properly clear of obstruction may be a boat belong to either of or states may add as somewhat remarkable that among all the states there be nonethat be not to a great or less extent bound on the ocean or the gulfof mexico or of the|great|lakes or some navigable river in fulfil constitutional duty fellow citizen on this subject as in carry into effect all other power confer by the constitution should consider as deliberate and act for and thesame country and bear constantly in mind that regard and dutyare due not to a particular part only but to the whole therefore recommend that appropriation be make for complete suchwork as have be already begin and for commence such other as mayseem to the wisdom of congress to be of public and general importance the difficulty and delay incident to the settlement of private claimsby congress amount in many case to a denial of justice there be reasonto apprehend that many unfortunate creditor of the government have therebybeen unavoidably ruin congress have so much business of a public characterthat be impossible should give much attention to mere private claim and accumulation be now so great that many claimant must despairof ever be able to obtain a hearing may well be doubt whethercongress from the nature of organization be properly constitutedto decide upon such case be impossible that each member should examinethe merit of every claim on which be compel to vote and be preposterousto ask a judge to decide a case which have never hear such decisionsmay

worth presidio and santa|fe situate on northwestern limit proceed to say that the commissioner have report to in an official form that the military officer employ in the service of the|united|state station at santa|fe interpose adversely with the inhabitant to the fulfillment of object in favor of the establishment of a separate state government east of the|rio|grande and within the rightful limit of the state of texas these county which texas thus propose to establish and organize as be within own jurisdiction extend over the whole of the territory east of the|rio|grande which have heretofore be regard as an essential and integral part of the department of new|mexico and actually govern and possess by people until conquer and sever from the|republic|of|mexico by the american arm the legislature of texas have be call together by governor for the purpose as be understand of maintain claim to the territory east of the|rio|grande and of establish over own jurisdiction and own law by force these proceeding of texas may well arrest the attention of all branch of and rejoice that occur while the congress be yet in session be fear far from be impossible that in consequence of these proceeding of texas a crisis may be bring on which shall summon the houses|of|congress and still more emphatically the executive government to an immediate readiness for the performance of respective duty by the|united|state the president be constitute commander in chief of the army and navy and of the militia of the several states when call into the actual service of the|united|state the constitution declare also that shall take care that the law be faithfully execute and that shall from time to time give to the congress information of the state of the union congress have power by the constitution to provide for call forth the militia to execute the law of the union and suitable and appropriate act of congress have be pass as well for provide for call forth the militia as for place other suitable and efficient mean in the hand of the president to enable to discharge the constitutional function of office the second section of the|act|of|the|28th|of|february,|1795 declare that whenever the law of the|united|state shall be oppose or execution obstruct in any state by combination too powerful to be suppress by the ordinary course of judicial proceeding or the power vest in the marshal the president may call forth the militia as far as may be necessary to suppress such combination and to cause the law to be duly execute by be provide that in all case of obstruction to the law either of the|united|state or any individual state or territory where be lawful for the president to call forth the militia for the purpose of cause the law to be duly execute shall be lawful for to employ for the same purpose such part of the land or naval force of the|united|state as shall be judge necessary these several enactment be now in full force so that if the law of the|united|state be oppose or obstruct in any state or territory by combination too powerful to be suppress by the judicial or civil authority become a case in which be the duty of the president either to call out the militia or to employ the military and naval force of the|united|state or to do both if in judgment the exigency of the occasion shall so require for the purpose of suppress such combination the constitutional duty of the president be plain and peremptory and the authority vest in by law for performance clear and ample texas be a state authorize to maintain own law so far as be not repugnant to the constitution law and treaty of the|united|state to suppress insurrection against authority and to punish those who may commit treason against the state accord to the form provide by own constitution and own law but all this power be local and confine entirely within the limit of texas can possibly confer no authority which can be lawfully exercise beyond own boundary all this be plain and hardly need argument or elucidation if texas militia therefore march into any of the other states or into any territory of the|united|state there to execute or enforce any law of texas become at that moment trespasser be no longer under the protection of any lawful authority and be to be regard merely as intruder and if within such state or territory obstruct any law of the|united|state either by power of arm or mere power of number constitute such a combination as be too powerful to be suppress by the civil authority the president of the|united|state have no option leave to but be bind to obey the solemn injunction of the constitution and exercise the high power vest in by that instrument and by the act of congress or if any civil posse armed or unarmed enter into any territory of the|united|state under the protection of the law thereof with intent to seize individual to be carry elsewhere for trial for alleged offense and this posse be too powerful to be resist by the local civil authority such seizure or attempt to seize be to be prevent or resist by the authority of the|united|state the grave and important question now arise whether there be in the|territory|of|new|mexico any exist law of opposition to which or the obstruction of which would constitute a case call for the interposition of the authority vest in the president the constitution of the|united|state declare this constitution and the law of the|united|state which shall be make in pursuance thereof and all treaty make or which shall be make under the authority of the|united|state shall be the supreme law of the land if therefore new|mexico be a territory of the|united|state and if any treaty stipulation be in force therein such treaty stipulation be the supreme law of the land and be to be maintain and uphold accordingly in the letter to the governor of texas reason be give for believe that new|mexico be now a territory of the|united|state with the same extent and the same boundary which belong to while in the actual possession of the|republic|of|mexico and before the late war in the early part of that war both california and new|mexico be conquer by the arm of the|united|state and be in the military possession of the|united|state at the date of the treaty of peace by that treaty the title by conquest be confirm and these territory province or department separate from mexico forever and by the same treaty certain important right and security be solemnly guarantee to the inhabitant reside therein by the fifth article of the treaty be declare the boundary line between the republics shall commence in the|gulf|of|mexico league from land opposite the mouth of the|rio|grande otherwise call rio|bravo|del|norte or opposite the mouth of deep branch if should have branch empty directly into the sea from thence up the middle of that river follow the deep channel where have to the point where strike the southern boundary of new|mexico thence westwardly along the whole southern boundary of new|mexico which run north of the town call paso to western termination thence northward along the western line of new|mexico until intersect the first branch of the river gila or if should not intersect any branch of that river then to the point on the say line nearest to such branch and thence in a direct line to the same thence down the middle of the say branch and of the say river until empty into the rio colorado thence across the rio colorado follow the division line between upper and lower|california to the eighth article of the treaty be in the follow term mexicans now establish in territory previously belong to mexico and which remain for the future within the limit of the|united|state as define by the present treaty shall be free to continue where now reside or to remove at any time to the|mexican|republic retain the property which possess in the say territory or dispose thereof and remove the proceed wherever please without be subject on this account to any contribution tax or charge whatever those who shall prefer to remain in the say territory may either retain the title and right of mexican citizen or acquire those of citizen of the|united|state but shall be under the obligation to make election within one|year from the date of the exchange of ratification of this treaty and those who shall remain in the say territory after the expiration of that|year without have declare intention to retain the character of mexicans shall be consider to have elect to become citizen of the|united|state in the say territory property of every kind now belong to mexicans not establish there shall be inviolably respect the present owner the heir of these and all mexicans who may hereafter acquire say property by contract shall enjoy with respect to guaranty equally ample as if the same belong to citizen of the|united|state the ninth article of the treaty be in these word the mexicans who in the territory aforesaid shall not preserve the character of citizen of the|mexican|republic conformably with what be stipulate in the precede article shall be incorporate into and be admit at the proper time to be judge of by the|congress|of|the|united|state to the enjoyment of all the right of citizen of the|united|state accord to the principle of the constitution and in the meantime shall be maintain and protect in the free enjoyment of liberty and property and secure in the free exercise of religion without restriction be plain therefore on the face of these treaty stipulation that all mexicans establish in territory north or east of the line of demarcation already mention come within the protection of the ninth article and that the treaty be a part of the supreme law of the land do extend over all such mexicans and assure to perfect security in the free enjoyment of liberty and property as well as in the free exercise of religion and this supreme law of the land be thus in actual force over this territory be to be maintain until shall be displace or supersede by other legal provision and if be obstruct or resist by combination too powerful to be suppress by the civil authority the case be which come within the provision of law and which oblige the president to enforce those provision neither the constitution nor the law nor duty nor oath of office leave any alternative or any choice in mode of action the executive government of the|united|state have no power or authority to determine what be the true line of boundary between mexico and the|united|state before the treaty of guadalupe|hidalgo nor have any such power now since the question have become a question between the state of texas and the|united|state so far as this boundary be doubtful that doubt can only be remove by some act of congress to which the assent of the state of texas may be necessary or by some appropriate mode of legal adjudication but in the meantime if disturbance or collision arise or should be threaten be absolutely incumbent on the executive government however painful the duty to take care that the law be faithfully maintain and can regard only the actual state of thing as exist at the date of the treaty and be bind to protect all inhabitant who be then establish and who now remain north and east of the line of demarcation in the full enjoyment of liberty and property accord to the provision of the ninth article of the treaty in other word all must be now regard as new|mexico which be possess and occupy as new|mexico by citizen of mexico at the date of the treaty until a definite line of boundary shall be establish by competent authority this assertion of duty to protect the people of new|mexico from threaten violence or from seizure to be carry into texas for trial for alleged offense against texan law do not at all include any claim of power on the part of the executive to establish any civil or military government within that territory that power belong exclusively to the legislative department and congress be the sole judge of the time and manner of create or authorize any such government the duty of the executive extend only to the execution of law and the maintenance of treaty already in force and the protection of all the people of the|united|state in the enjoyment of the right which those treaty and law guarantee be exceedingly desirable that no occasion should arise for the exercise of the power thus vest in the president by the constitution and the law with whatever mildness those power may be execute or however clear the case of necessity yet consequence may nevertheless follow of which no human sagacity can foresee either the evil or the end have thus lay before congress the communication of excellency the governor of texas and the answer thereto and have make such observation as have think the occasion call for respect constitutional obligation which may arise in the further progress of thing and may devolve on to be perform hope shall not be regard as step aside from the line of duty notwithstanding that be aware that the subject be now before both houses if express deep and earnest conviction of the importance of an immediate decision or arrangement or settlement of the question of boundary between texas and the|territory|of|new|mexico all consideration of justice general expediency and domestic tranquillity call for this seem to be in character and by position the first or of the first of the question grow out of the acquisition of california and new|mexico and now require decision no government can be establish for new|mexico either state or territorial until shall be first ascertain what new|mexico be and what be limit and boundary these can not be fix or know till the line of division between and texas shall be ascertain and establish and numerous and weighty reason conspire in judgment to show that this divisional line should be establish by congress with the assent of the government of texas in the first place this seem by far the most prompt mode of proceed by which the end can be accomplish if judicial proceeding be resort to such proceeding would necessarily be slow and year would pass by in all probability before the controversy could be end so great a delay in this case be to be avoid if possible such delay would be every way inconvenient and may be the occasion of disturbance and collision for the same reason would with the utmost deference to the wisdom of congress express a doubt of the expediency of the appointment of commissioner and of an examination estimate and an award of indemnity to be make by this would be but a species of arbitration which may last as long as a suit at law so far as be able to comprehend the case the general fact be now all know and congress be as capable of decide on justly and properly now as probably would be after the report of the commissioner if the claim of title on the part of texas appear to congress to be well round in whole or in part be in the competency of congress to offer an indemnity for the surrender of that claim in a case like this surround as be by many cogent consideration all call for amicable adjustment and immediate settlement the|government|of|the|united|state would be justify in opinion in allow an indemnity to texas not unreasonable or extravagant but fair liberal and award in a just spirit of accommodation think no event would be hail with more gratification by the people of the|united|state than the amicable adjustment of question of difficulty which have now for a long time agitate the country and occupy to the exclusion of other subject the time and attention of congress have thus freely communicate the result of own reflection on the most advisable mode of adjust the boundary question shall nevertheless cheerfully acquiesce in any other mode which the wisdom of congress may devise and in conclusion repeat conviction that every consideration of the public interest manifest the necessity of a provision by congress for the settlement of this boundary question before the present session be bring to a close the settlement of other question connect with the same subject within the same period be greatly to be desire but the adjustment of this appear to to be in the high degree important in the train of such an adjustment may well hope that there will follow a return of harmony and good will an increase attachment to the union and the general satisfaction of the country transcript to the senate of the|united|state herewith transmit to the senate for advice with regard to ratification a convention between the|united|state and great|britain conclude at washington on the|19th instant by john|m.|clayton secretary of state on the part of the|united|state and by the|right|hon sir henry|lytton|bulwer on the part of great|britain this treaty have be negotiate in accordance with the

to every other interoceanic communication which may be adopt to shorten the transit to or from territory on the pacific will be see that this treaty do not propose to take money from the public treasury to effect any object contemplate by yield protection to the capitalist who may undertake to construct any canal or railway across the isthmus commence in the southern part of mexico and terminate in the territory of new|granada give no preference to any route over another but propose the same measure of protection for all which ingenuity and enterprise can construct should this treaty be ratified will secure in future the liberation of from any kind of foreign aggression at the time negotiation be open with nicaragua for the construction of a canal through territory find great|britain in possession of nearly|half of central|america as the ally and protector of the|mosquito|k have be object in negotiate this treaty not only to secure the passage across the isthmus to the government and citizen of the|united|state by the construction of a great highway dedicate to the use of all nation on equal term but to maintain the independence and sovereignty of all the|central|american|republic the senate will judge how far these object have be effect if there be any who would desire to seize and annex any portion of the territory of these weak sister republic to the|american|union or to extend dominion over do not concur in policy and wish to be understand in reference to that subject that adopt the view entertain so far as know by all predecessor the principle by which have be regulate in the negotiation of this treaty be in accordance with the sentiment well express by immediate predecessor on the|10th|of|february,|1847 when communicate to the senate the treaty with new|granada for the protection of the railroad at panama be in accordance with the whole spirit of the resolution of the senate of the of march refer to by president polk and with the policy adopt by president jackson immediately after the passage of that resolution who dispatch an agent to central|america and new|granada to open negotiation with those government for the purpose of effectually protect by suitable treaty stipulation with such individual or company as may undertake to open a communication between the atlantic and pacific ocean by the construction of a ship canal across the isthmus which connect north|and|south|america and of secure forever by such stipulation the free and equal right of navigate such canal to all such nation on the payment of such reasonable toll as may be establish to compensate the capitalist who should engage in such undertaking and complete the work also communicate herewith a copy of the correspondence between the american secretary of state and the british plenipotentiary at the time of conclude the treaty whatever honor may be due to the party first propose such a treaty justly belong to the|united|state predecessor in message of the 10th of february refer to the treaty with new|granada for the protection of the|panama|railroad observe should the proposition thus tender be reject may deprive the|united|state of the just influence which acceptance may secure to and confer the glory and benefit of be the first among the nation in conclude such an arrangement upon the government either of great|britain or france that either of these government would embrace the offer can not be doubt because there do not appear to be any other effectual mean of secure to all nation the advantage of this important passage but the guaranty of great commercial power that the isthmus shall be neutral territory the interest of the world at stake be so important that the security of this passage between the ocean can not be suffer to depend upon the war and revolution which may arise among different nation should the senate in wisdom see fit to confirm this treaty and the treaty heretofore submit by for advice in regard to ratification negotiate with the state of nicaragua on will be necessary to amend or both of so that both treaty may stand in conformity with each other in spirit and intention the senate will discover by examine both that this be a task of no great difficulty have good reason to believe that france and russia stand ready to accede to this treaty and that no other great maritime state will refuse accession to an arrangement so well calculated to diffuse the blessing of peace commerce and civilization and so honorable to all nation which may enter into the engagement transcript to the senate of the|united|state transmit to the senate in answer to a resolution of that body pass on the 17th instant the accompany report of head of department which contain all the official information in the possession of the executive ask for by the resolution on come into office find the military commandant of the|department|of|california exercise the function of civil governor in that territory and leave as be to act under the treaty of guadalupe|hidalgo without the aid of any legislative provision establish a government in that territory think best not to disturb that arrangement make under predecessor until congress should take some action on that subject therefore do not interfere with the power of the military commandant who continue to exercise the function of civil governor as before but make no such appointment confer no such authority and have allow no increase compensation to the commandant for service with a view to the faithful execution of the treaty so far as lie in the power of the executive and to enable congress to act at the present session with as full knowledge and as little difficulty as possible on all matter of interest in these territories send the hon thomas|butler|ke as bearer of dispatch to california and certain officer to california and new|mexico whose duty be particularly define in the accompany letter of instruction address to severally by the proper departments do not hesitate to express to the people of those territories desire that each territory should if prepare to comply with the requisition of the|united|state form a plan of a state constitution and submit the same to congress with a prayer for admission into the union as a state but do not anticipate suggest or authorize the establishment of any such government without the assent of congress nor do authorize any government agent or officer to interfere with or exercise any influence or control over the election of delegate or over any convention in make or modify domestic institution or any of the provision of propose constitution on the contrary the instruction give by order be that all measure of domestic policy adopt by the people of california must originate solely with that while the executive of the|united|state be desirous to protect in the formation of any government republican in character to be at the proper time submit to congress yet be to be distinctly understand that the plan of such a government must at the same time be the result of own deliberate choice and originate with without the interference of the executive be unable to give any information as to law pass by any suppose government in california or of any census take in either of the territories mention in the resolution as have no information on those subject as already state have not disturb the arrangement which find have exist under predecessor in advise an early application by the people of these territories for admission as states be actuate principally by an earnest desire to afford to the wisdom and patriotism of congress the opportunity of avoid occasion of bitter and angry dissension among the people of the|united|state under the constitution every state have the right of establish and from time to time alter municipal law and domestic institution independently of every other state and of the|general|government subject only to the prohibition and guaranty expressly set forth in the|united|state the subject thus leave exclusively to the respective states be not design or expect to become topic of national agitation still as under the constitution congress have power to make all needful rule and regulation respect the|territories|of|the|united|state every new acquisition of territory have lead to discussion on the question whether the system of involuntary servitude which prevail in many of the states should or should not be prohibit in that territory the period of excitement from this cause which have heretofore occur have be safely pass but during the interval of whatever length which may elapse before the admission of the territories cede by mexico as states appear probable that similar excitement will prevail to an undue extent under these circumstance think and still think that be duty to endeavor to put in the power of congress by the admission of california and new|mexico as states to remove all occasion for the unnecessary agitation of the public mind be understand that the people of the western part of california have form a plan of a state constitution and will soon submit the same to the judgment of congress and apply for admission as a state this course on part though in accordance with be not adopt exclusively in consequence of any expression of wish inasmuch as measure tend to this end have be promote by the officer send there by predecessor and be already in active progress of execution before any communication from reach california if the propose constitution shall when submit to congress be find to be in compliance with the requisition of the|united|state earnestly recommend that may receive the sanction of congress the part of california not include in the propose state of that name be believe to be uninhabite except in a settlement of countryman in the vicinity of salt|lake a claim have be advance by the state of texas to a very large portion of the most populous district of the territory commonly designate by the name of new|mexico if the people of new|mexico have form a plan of a state government for that territory as cede by the treaty of guadalupe|hidalgo and have be admit by congress as a state constitution would have afford the mean of obtain an adjustment of the question of boundary with texas by a judicial decision at present however no judicial tribunal have the power of decide that question and remain for congress to devise some mode for adjustment meanwhile submit to congress the question whether would be expedient before such adjustment to establish a territorial government which by include the district so claim would practically decide the question adversely to the|state of texas or by exclude would decide in favor in opinion such a course would not be expedient especially as the people of this territory still enjoy the benefit and protection of municipal law originally derive from mexico and have a military force station there to protect against the indians be undoubtedly true that the property live liberty and religion of the people of new|mexico be better protect than ever be before the treaty of cession should congress when california shall present for incorporation into the union annex a condition to admission as a state affect domestic institution contrary to the wish of people and even compel temporarily to comply with yet the state could change constitution at any time after admission when to should seem expedient any attempt to deny to the people of the state the right of self government in a matter which peculiarly affect will infallibly be regard by as an invasion of right and upon the principle lay down in own declaration|of|independence will certainly be sustain by the great mass of the american people to assert that be a conquered people and must as a state submit to the will of conqueror in this regard will meet with no cordial response among american freeman great number of be native citizen of the|united|state not inferior to the rest of countryman in intelligence and patriotism and no language of menace to restrain in the exercise of an undoubted right substantially guarantee to by the treaty of cession shall ever be utter by or encourage and sustain by person act under authority be to be expect that in the residue of the territory cede to by mexico the people reside there will at the time of incorporation into the union as a state settle all question of domestic policy to suit no material inconvenience will result from the want for a short period of a government establish by congress over that part of the territory which lie eastward of the new state of california and the reason for opinion that new|mexico will at no very distant period ask for admission into the union be round on unofficial information which suppose be common to all who have care to make inquiry on that subject see then that the question which now excite such painful sensation in the country will in the end certainly be settle by the silent effect of cause independent of the action of congress again submit to wisdom the policy recommend in annual message of await the salutary operation of those cause believe that shall thus avoid the creation of geographical party and secure the harmony of feel so necessary to the beneficial action of political system connect as the union be with the remembrance of past happiness the sense of present blessing and the hope of future peace and prosperity every dictate of wisdom every feeling of duty and every emotion of patriotism tend to inspire fidelity and devotion to and admonish cautiously to avoid any unnecessary controversy which can either endanger or impair strength the chief element of which be to be find in the regard and affection of the people for each other
