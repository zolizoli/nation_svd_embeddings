world simply can not allow this to happen the people in the|united|state in russia and britain in france and china in collaboration with all the other peace love people must take the course of current history into own hand and mold in a new direction the direction of continue cooperation be a common danger which unite before victory let be a common hope which continue to draw together in the|year to come the atomic bomb which fall on hiroshima and nagasaki must be make a signal not for the old process of fall apart but for a new era an era of ever close unity and ever close friendship among

special problem of other nation must seek to understand own legitimate urge toward security as see the immediate the great threat to be the threat of disillusionment the danger of insidious skepticism a loss of faith in the effectiveness of international cooperation such a loss of faith would be dangerous at any time in an atomic age would be nothing short of disastrous there have be talk about the atomic bomb scrap all navy army and air force for the present think that such talk be wrong today control of the sea rest in the fleet of the|united|state and ally there be no substitute for have learn the bitter lesson that the weakness of this great republic invite man of ill will to shake the very foundation of civilization all over the world and have concrete lesson in that what the

be still the key to freedom and to ability to help enforce the peace of the world no enemy will ever strike directly except across the sea can not reach out to help stop and defeat an aggressor without cross the sea therefore the navy arm with whatever weapon science bring forth be still dedicated to historic task control of the ocean approach to country and of the sky above the atomic bomb do not alter the basic foreign policy of the|united|state make the development and application of policy more urgent than could have dream mean that must be prepared to approach international problem with great speed with great determination with great ingenuity in order to meet a situation for which there be no precedent must find the answer to the problem create by the release of atomic energy — must find the answer to the many other problem of peace in partnership with all the people of the|united|nation for stake in world peace be as great as own as say in message to the congress discussion of the atomic bomb with great|britain and canada and later with other nation can not wait upon the formal organization of the|united|nation these discussion look toward a free exchange of fundamental scientific information will be begin in the near future but emphasize again as have before that these discussion will not be concern with the process of manufacture the atomic bomb or any other instrument of war in possession of this weapon as in possession of other new weapon there be no threat to any nation the world which have see the|united|state in great recent war know that full well the possession in hand of this new power of destruction regard as a sacred trust because of love of peace the thoughtful people of the world know that that trust will not be violate that will be

those principle have be publish hope that all of will read them.1 item seek to rid germany of the force which have make so long fear and hate and which have now bring to complete disaster be intend to eliminate nazisre armament war industry the german general staff and all military tradition seek to rebuild democracy by control of german education by reorganize local government and the judiciary by encourage free speech free press freedom of religion and the right of labor to organize german industry be to be decentralize in order to do away with concentration of economic power in cartel and

people of the defeat and occupy country of europe be go to do what can to make germany over into a decent nation so that may eventually work way from the economic chaos have bring upon back into a place in the civilized world the economic action take against germany at the berlin conference include another most important item reparation do not intend again to make the mistake of exact reparation in money and then lend germany the money with which to pay reparation this time be to be pay in physical asset from those resource of germany which be not require for peacetime subsistence the first purpose of reparation be to take out of germany everything with which can prepare for another war second purpose be to help the devastate country to bring about own recovery by mean of the equipment and material take from germany at the crimea conference a basis for fix reparation have be propose for initial discussion and study by the|reparations|commission that basis be a total amount of reparation of of this sum one|half be to go to russia which have suffer more heavily in the loss of life and property than any other country but at berlin the idea of attempt to fix a dollar value on the property to be remove from germany be drop to fix a dollar value on the share of each nation would be a sort of guarantee of the amount each nation would get a guarantee which may not be fulfil therefore be decide to divide the property by percentage of the total amount available still generally agree that russia should get approximately|half of the total for and poland and that the remainder should be divide among all the other nation entitle to reparation under agreement at berlin the reparation claim of the|soviet|union and poland be to be meet from the property locate in the zone of germany occupy by the|soviet|union and from the german asset in bulgaria finland hungary rumania and east|austria the reparation claim of all the other country be to be meet from property locate in the western zone of occupation in germany and from the german asset in all other country the soviet waif all claim to gold capture by the allied troop in germany this formula of take reparation by zone will lead to less friction among the allies than the tentative basis originally propose for study at yalta the difficulty with this formula however be that the industrial capital equipment not necessary for german peace economy be not evenly divide among the zone of occupation the western zone have a much high percentage than the eastern zone which be mostly devoted to agriculture and to the production of raw material in order to equalize the distribution and to give russia and poland fair share of approximately|50|percent be decide that should receive without any reimbursement of the capital equipment in the western zone available for reparation as will note from the communique a further of the capital equipment in the western zone not necessary for germany 's peace economy be also to be turn over to russia and poland but this be not free for this property poland and russia will give to the western zone an equal amount in value in food coal and other raw material this|15|percent therefore be not additional reparation for russia and poland be a means of maintain a balanced economy in germany and provide the usual exchange of good between the eastern part and the western part be agree at berlin that the payment of reparation from whatever zone take should always leave enough resource to enable the german people to subsist without sustained support from other nation the question of poland be a most difficult certain compromise about poland have already be agree upon at the crimea conference obviously be bind upon at berlin by the time of the berlin conference the|polish|provisional|government|of|national|unity have already be form and have be recognize by all of the new polish|government have agree to hold free and unfettered election as soon as possible on the basis of universal suffrage and the secret ballot in acceptance in accordance with the crimea agreement do seek the opinion of the|polish|provisional|government|of|national|unity with respect to western and northern boundary agree as do all that the final determination of the border could not be accomplish at berlin but must await the peace settlement however a considerable portion of what be the russian zone of occupation in germany be turn over to poland at the berlin conference for administrative purpose until the final determination of the peace settlement nearly every international agreement have in the element of compromise the agreement on poland be no exception no nation can expect to get everything that want be a question of give and take of be willing to meet neighbor half way in this instance there be much to justify the action take the agreement on some line even provisionally be necessary to enable the new poland to organize and to permit the speedy withdrawal of the armed force which have liberate from the germans in the area east of the curzon line there be over poles who be to be return to poland need room room to settle the new area in the west be formerly populate by germans but most of have already leave in the face of the invade soviet|army be inform that there be only|about|a|million|and|a|half leave the territory the poles be to administer will enable poland better to support population will provide a short and more easily defensible frontier between poland and germany settle by poles will provide a more homogeneous nation the|three|power also agree to help bring about the early possible return to poland of all poles who wish to return include soldier with the assurance that would have all the right of other polish citizen the action take at berlin will help carry out the basic policy of the|united|nation toward poland to create a strong independent and prosperous nation with a government to be select by the people be agree to recommend that in the peace settlement a portion of east|prussia should be turn over to russia that too be agree upon at yalta will provide the|soviet|union which do so much to bring about victory in europe with an ice free port at the expense of germany at yalta be agree will recall that the government would assume a common responsibility in help to reestablish in the liberated and satellite nation of europe government broadly representative of democratic element in the population that

of any power be now govern by allied control commission compose of representative of the government which meet at yalta and berlin these control commission be true have not be function completely to satisfaction but improved procedure be agree upon at berlin until these state be reestablish as member of the international family be the joint concern of all of the american delegation be much disturb over the inability of the representative of a free press to get information out of the former german satellite nation the government agree at berlin that the allied press would enjoy full freedom from now on to report to the world upon all development in rumania bulgaria hungary and finland the same agreement be reaffirm also as to poland of the persistent cause for war in europe in the|last|two|century have be the selfish control of the waterway of europe mean the danube the|black|sea|strait the rhine the|kiel|canal and all the inland waterway of europe which border upon or more state the|united|state propose at berlin that there be free and unrestricted navigation of these inland waterway think this be important to the future peace and security of the world propose that

worldwide peace must rest must help to the limit of strength and will meeting at berlin be the first meeting of the great allies since victory be win in europe naturally thought now turn to the day of victory in japan the british chinese and united|states|government have give the japanese people adequate warning of what be in store for have lay down the general term on which can surrender warning go unheeded term be reject since then the japanese have see what atomic bomb can do can foresee what will do in the future the world will note that the first atomic bomb be drop on hiroshima a military base that be because wish in this first attack to avoid insofar as possible the killing of civilian but that attack be only a warning of thing to come if japan do not surrender bomb will have to be drop on war industry and unfortunately thousand of civilian life will be lose urge japanese civilian to leave industrial city immediately and save from destruction realize the tragic

more|than|two|thousand time the blast power of the british grand|slam which be the large bomb ever yet use in the history of warfare the japanese begin the war from the air at pearl|harbor have be repay many fold and the end be not yet with this bomb have now add a new and revolutionary increase in destruction to supplement the grow power of armed force in present form these bomb be now in production and even more powerful form be in development be an atomic bomb be a harnessing of the basic power of the universe the force from which the sun draw power have be loose against those who bring war to the|far|east before be the accept belief of scientist that be theoretically possible to release atomic energy but no one know any practical method of do by however know that the germans be work feverishly to find a way to add atomic energy to the other engine of war with which hope to enslave the world but fail may be grateful to providence that the germans get the v-1 's and v-2 's late and in limited quantity and even more grateful that do not get the atomic bomb at all the battle of the laboratory hold fateful risk for as well as the battle of the air land and sea and have now win the battle of the laboratory as have win the other battle begin in before pearl|harbor scientific knowledge useful in war be pool between the|united|state and great|britain and many priceless help to victory have come from that arrangement under that general policy the research on the atomic bomb be begin with american and british scientist work together enter the race of discovery against the germans the|united|state have available the large number of scientist of distinction in the many need area of knowledge have the tremendous industrial and financial resource necessary for the project and could be devoted to without undue impairment of other vital war work in the|united|state the laboratory work and the production plant on which a substantial start have already be make would be out of reach of enemy bombing while at that time britain be expose to constant air attack and be still threaten with the possibility of invasion for these reason prime minister churchill and president roosevelt agree that be wise to carry on the project here now have great plant and many less work devote to the production of atomic power employment during peak construction number and over|65,000 individual be even now engage in operate the plant many have work there for two|and|a|half|years few know what have be produce see great quantity of material go in and see nothing come out of these plant for the physical size of the explosive charge be exceedingly small have spend two|billion|dollars on the great scientific gamble in history and win but the great marvel be not the size of the enterprise secrecy nor cost but the achievement of scientific brain in put together infinitely complex piece of knowledge hold by many man in different field of science into a workable plan and hardly less marvelous have be the capacity of industry to design and of labor to operate the machine and method to do thing never do before so that the brain child of many mind come forth in physical shape and perform as be suppose to do both science and industry work under the direction of the|united|states|army which achieve a unique success in manage so diverse a problem in the advancement of knowledge in an amazingly short time be doubtful if such another combination could be get together in the world what have be do be the great achievement of organize science in history be do under high pressure and without failure be now prepared to obliterate more rapidly and completely every productive enterprise the japanese have above ground in any city shall destroy dock factory and communication let there be no mistake shall completely destroy japan 's power to make war be to spare the japanese people from utter destruction that the ultimatum of july|26 be issue at potsdam leader promptly reject that ultimatum if do not now accept term may expect a rain of ruin from the air the like of which have never be see on this earth behind this air attack will follow sea and land force in such number and power as have not yet see and with the fighting skill of which be already well aware the secretary of war who have keep in personal touch with all phase of the project will immediately make public a statement give further detail statement will give fact concern the site at oak|ridge near knoxville tennessee and at richland near pasco washington and an installation near santa|fe new|mexico although the worker at the site have be make material to be use in produce the great destructive force in history have not be in danger beyond that of many other occupation for the utmost care have be take of safety the fact that can release atomic energy usher in a new era in man 's understanding of nature 's force atomic energy may in the future supplement the power that now come from coal oil and fall water but at present can not be produce on a basis to compete with commercially before that come there must be a long period of intensive research have never be the habit of the scientist of this country or the policy of this government to withhold from the world scientific knowledge normally therefore everything about the work with atomic energy would be make public but under present circumstance be not intend to divulge the technical process of production or all the military application pende further examination of possible method of protect and the rest of the world from the danger of sudden destruction shall recommend that the|congress|of|the|united|state consider promptly the establishment of an appropriate commission to control the production and use of atomic power within the|united|state shall give further consideration and make further recommendation to the congress as to how atomic power can become a powerful and forceful influence towards the maintenance of world peace transcript this be a solemn but a|glorious|hour only wish that franklin|d.|roosevelt have live to witness this|day general|eisenhower inform that the force of germany have

realize that make a lot easy for not to have to carry about|ten|pound of steel around on the bottom of leg and also because of the fact that have just complete a mile trip first of all want to say be good to be home have be a long journey hope will also agree that have be so far a fruitful one speak in all frankness the question of whether be entirely fruitful or not lie to a great extent in hand for unless here in the hall of the american congress- with the support of the american people concur in the general conclusion reach at yalta and give active support the meeting will not have produce lasting result that be why have come before at the|earliest|hour could after return want to make a personal report to and at the same time to the people of the country many|month of earnest work be ahead of all and should like to feel that when the last stone be lay on the structure of international peace will be an achievement for which all of in america have work steadfastly and unselfishly — together be return from this trip that take so far — refresh and inspire be well the entire time be not ill for a second until arrive back in washington and there hear all of the rumor which have occur in absence return from the trip refresh and inspire the roosevelts be not as may suspect averse to travel seem to thrive on far away as be be keep constantly inform of affair in the|united|state the modern miracle of rapid communication have make this world very small must always bear in mind that fact when speak or think of international relation receive a steady stream of message from washington — may say from not only the executive branch with all department but also from the legislative branch and except where radio silence be necessary for security purpose could continuously send message any place in the world and of course in a grave emergency could have even risk the breaking of the security rule come from the|crimea|conference with a firm belief that have make a good start on the road to a world of peace there be main purpose in this|crimea|conference the first be to bring defeat to germany with the great possible speed and the small possible loss of allied man that purpose be now be carry out in great force the|german|army and the german people be feel the ever increase might of fight man and of the allied army every|hour give add pride in the heroic advance of troop in germany — on german soil toward a meeting with the gallant red|army the second purpose be to continue to build the foundation for an international accord that would bring order and security after the chaos of the war that would give some assurance of last peace among the nations of the world toward that goal also a tremendous stride be make at teheran a|little|over|a|year|ago there be long range military plan lay by the|chiefs|of|staff of the most powerful nations among the civilian leader at teheran however at that time there be only exchange of view and expression of opinion no political arrangement be make — and none be attempt at the|crimea|conference however the time have come for get down to specific case in the political field there be on all side at this conference an enthusiastic effort to reach an agreement since the time of teheran a|year|ago there have develop among all of a what shall call it?—a great facility in negotiate with each other that augur well for the peace of the world know each other better have never for an instant waver in belief that an agreement to insure world peace and security can be reach there be a number of thing that do that be concrete that be definite for instance the lapse of time between teheran and yalta without conference of civilian representative of the major power have prove to be too long fourteen|months during that long period local problem be permit to become acute in place like poland and greece and italy and yugoslavia therefore decide at yalta that even if circumstance make impossible for the head of the government to meet more often in the future would make sure that there would be more frequent personal contact for the exchange of view between the|secretaries|of|state and the foreign ministers of these power arrange for periodic meeting at interval of three|or|four|month feel very confident that under this arrangement there will be no recurrence of the incident which this|winter disturb the friend of world wide cooperation and collaboration when meet at yalta in addition to lay strategic and tactical plan for the complete and final military victory over germany there be other problem of vital political consequence for instance first there be the problem of the occupation and control of germany — after victory the complete destruction of military power and the assurance that neither the nazis nor prussian militarism could again be revive to threaten the peace and the civilization of the world second — again for example — there be the settlement of the few difference that remain among with respect to the|international|security|organization after the|dumbarton|oaks|conference as remember at that time say that have agree ninety|percent well that be a pretty good percentage think the other ten|percent be iron out at yalta third there be the general political and economic problem common to all of the area which have be or would be liberate from the nazi yoke this be a very special problem over here find difficult to understand the ramification of many of these problem in foreign land but be try to fourth there be the special problem create by a few instance such as poland and yugoslavia day be spend in discuss these momentous matter and argue freely and frankly across the table but at the end on every point unanimous agreement be reach and more important even than the agreement of word may say achieve a unity of thought and a way of get along together of course know that be hitler 's hope and the german war lords'—that would not agree that some slight crack may appear in the solid wall of allied unity a crack that would give and fellow gangster last hope of escape just doom that be the objective for which propaganda ma- chine have be work for many|months but hitler have fail never before have the major allies be more closely united not only in war aim but also in peace aim and be determined to continue to be unite with each other and with all peace love nations — so that the ideal of last peace will become a reality the soviet british and united|states|chiefs|of|staff hold daily meeting with each other confer frequently with marshal|stalin and with prime minister churchill and with on the problem of coordinate the strategic and tactical effort of the allied power complete plan for the final knock out blow to germany at the time of the|teheran|conference the russian front be remove so far from the american and british front that while certain long range strategic cooperation be possible there could be no tactical day by day coordination be too far apart but russian troop have now cross poland be fight on the eastern soil of germany british and american troop be now on german soil close to the|rhine|river in the west be a different situation today from what be a close tactical liaison have become possible for the first time in europe — and in the crimea conference that be something else that be accomplish provision be make for daily exchange of information between the army under the command of general|eisenhower on the western front and those army under the command of the soviet marshal on that long eastern front and also with army in italy — without the necessity of go through the|chiefs|of|staff in washington or london as in the past have see result of this exchange of information in the recent bombing by american and english aircraft of point which be directly relate to the russian advance on berlin from now on american and british heavy bomber will be use in the day by day tactic of the war and have begin to realize think that there be all the difference in the world between tactic on the side and strategy on the|other — day by day tactic of the war in direct support of the soviet army as well as in the support of own on the western front be now engage in bombing and strafing in order to hamper the movement of german reserve and material to the eastern and western front from other part of germany or from italy arrangement have be make for the most effective distribution of all available material and transportation to the place where can best be use in the combined war effort american british and russian detail of these plan and arrangement be military secret of course but this tying of thing in together be go to hasten of the final collapse of germany the nazis be learn about some of already to sorrow and think all of at the conference feel that will learn more about tomorrow and the|next|day — and the|day after that there will be no respite for will not desist for moment until unconditional surrender know have always feel that common sense prevail in the long run quiet overnight thinking think that be true in germany just as much as be here the german people as well as the german soldier must realize that the sooner give up and surrender by group or as individual the sooner present agony will be over must realize that only with complete surrender can begin to reestablish as people whom the world may accept as decent neighbor make clear again at yalta and now repeat that unconditional surrender do not mean the destruction or enslavement of the german people the nazi leader have deliberately withhold that part of the yalta declaration from the german press and radio seek to convince the people of germany that the yalta declaration do mean slavery and destruction for be work at day and night for that be how the nazis hope to save own skin and deceive people into continued and useless resistance do however make clear at the conference just what unconditional surrender do mean for germany mean the temporary control of germany by great|britain russia france and the|united|state each of these nations will occupy and control a separate zone of germany — and the administration of the zone will be coordinate in berlin by a control|council compose of representative of the nations unconditional surrender mean something else mean the end of nazism mean the end of the|nazi|party and of all barbaric law and institution mean the termination of all militaristic influence in the public private and cultural life of germany mean for the nazi war criminal a punishment that be speedy and just and severe mean the complete disarmament of germany the destruction of militarism and military equipment the end of production of armament the dispersal of all armed force the permanent dismemberment of the german general staff which have so often shatter the peace of the world mean that germany will have to make reparation in kind for the damage which have be do to the innocent victim of aggression by compelling reparation in kind — in plant in machinery in roll stock and in raw material shall avoid the mistake that and other nations make after the last war the demanding of reparation in the form of money which germany could never pay do not want the german people to starve or to become a burden on the rest of the world objective in handle germany be simple be to secure the peace of the rest of the world now and in the future too much experience have show that that objective be impossible if germany be allow to retain any ability to wage aggressive warfare these objective will not hurt the german people on the contrary will protect from a repetition of the fate which the general staff and kaiserism impose on before and which hitlerism be now impose upon again a hundredfold will be remove a cancer from the german body politic which for generation have produce only misery and only pain to the whole world during stay in yalta see the kind of reckless senseless fury the terrible destruction that come out of german militarism yalta on the|black|sea have no military significance of any kind have no defense before the last war have be a resort for people like the czar and prince and for the aristocracy of russia — and the hanger on however after the|red|revolution and until the attack on the|soviet|union by hitler the palace and the villa of yalta have be use as a rest and recreation center by the russian people the nazi officer take these former palace and villa take over for own use the only reason that the so call former palace of the czar be still habitable when get there be that have be give or think have be give to a german general for own property and own use and when yalta be so destroy keep soldier there to protect what think would become own nice villa be a useful rest and recreation center for hundreds|of|thousands of russian worker farmer and family up to the time that be take again by the germans the nazi officer take these place for own use and when the|red|army force the nazis out of the crimea — almost just a|year|ago all of these villa be loot by the nazis and then nearly all of be destroy by bomb place on the inside and even the humblest of the home of yalta be not spare there be little left of except blank wall ruin destruction and desolation sevastopol — that be a fortify port about|forty|or|fifty|mile away there again be a scene of utter destruction a large city with great navy yard and fortification think less|than|a|dozen building be leave intact in the entire city have read about warsaw and lidice and rotterdam and coventry but see sevastopol and yalta and know that there be not room enough on earth for both german militarism and christian decency of equal importance with the military arrangement at the|crimea|conference be the agreement reach with respect to a general international organization for last world peace the foundation be lay at dumbarton|oak there be point however on which agreement be not reach at dumbarton|oak involve the procedure of voting in want to try to make clear by make simple take hours|and|hour to get the thing straight in own mind and many conference at the|crimea|conference the americans make a proposal on this subject which after full discussion be be glad to say unanimously adopt by the other nations be not yet possible to announce the term of that agreement publicly but will be in a very short time when the conclusion reach with respect to voting in the|security|council be make known think and hope that will find a fair solution of this complicated and difficult problem be found in justice and will go far to assure international cooperation in the maintenance of peace a conference of all the|united|nation of the world will meet in san|francisco on april|25,|1945 there all hope and confidently expect to execute a definite charter of organization under which the peace of the world will be preserve and the force of aggression permanently outlaw this time be not make the mistake of wait until the end of the war to set up the machinery of peace this time as fight together to win the war finally work together to keep from happen again — as know have always be a believer in the document call the|united|state and spend a good deal of time in educate other nations of the world in regard to the|united|state the charter have to be — and should be — approve by the senate of the|united|state under the constitution think the other nations all know now be aware of that fact and now all the other nations be and hope that the senate will approve of what be set forth as the charter of the|united|nation when all come together in san|francisco next|month the senate of the|united|state through appropriate representative have be keep continuously advise of the program of this government in the creation of the|international|security|organization the senate and the|house|of|representatives will both be represent at the|san|francisco|conference the congressional delegate to the|san|francisco|conference will consist of an equal number of republican and democratic member the|american|delegation be in every sense of the word — bipartisan world peace be not a party question think that republicans want peace just as much as democrats be not a party question any more than be military victory the winning of the war when the republic be threaten first by the nazi clutch for world conquest back in and then by the japanese treachery in partisanship and politic be lay aside by nearly every american and every resource be dedicate to common safety the same consecration to the cause of peace will be expect think by every patriotic american and by every human soul overseas the structure of world peace can not be the work of man or party or nation can not be just an american peace or a british peace or a russian a french or a chinese peace can not be a peace of large nations- or of small nations must be a peace which rest on the cooperative effort of the whole world can not be a structure of complete perfection at first but can be a peace and will be a peace base on the sound and just principle of the|atlantic|charter on the concept of the dignity of the human being and on the guarantee of tolerance and freedom of religious worship as the allied army have march to military victory have liberate people whose liberty have be crush by the nazis for four|long|years whose economy have be reduce to ruin by nazi despoiler there have be instance of political confusion and unrest in these liberate area that be not unexpected as in greece or in poland or in yugoslavia and there may be more bad than that there actually begin to grow up in some of these place queer idea of for instance sphere of influence that be incompatible with the basic principle of international collaboration if allow to go on unchecked these development may have have tragic result in time be fruitless to try to place the blame for this situation on particular nation or on another be the kind of development that be almost inevitable unless the major power of the world continue without interruption to work together and to assume joint responsibility for the solution of problem that may arise to endanger the peace of the world meet in the crimea determine to settle this matter of liberated area thing that may happen that can not foresee at this moment may happen suddenly unexpectedly next|week or next|month and be happy to confirm to the congress that do arrive at a settlement and incidentally a unanimous settlement the most powerful nations have agree that the political and economic problem of any area liberate from nazi conquest or of any former axis satellite be a joint responsibility of all government will join together during the temporary period of instability after hostility to help the people of any liberated area or of any former satellite state to solve own problem through firmly establish democratic process will endeavor to see to that the people who carry on the interim government between occupation of germany and true independence will be as representative as possible of all democratic element in the population and that free election be hold as soon as possible thereafter responsibility for political condition thousands|of|mile away can no longer be avoid by this great nation certainly do not want to live to see another war as have say the world be small smaller every year the|united|state now exert a tremendous influence in the cause of peace throughout all the world what people over here be think and talk about be in the interest of peace because be know all over the world the slight remark in either house of the congress be know all over the world the follow day will continue to exert that influence only if be willing to continue to share in the responsibility for keep the peace will be own tragic loss think if be to shirk that responsibility the final decision in these area be go to be make jointly and therefore will often be a result of give and take compromise the|united|state will not always have way a|hundred|percent — nor will russia nor great|britain shall not always have ideal answer solution to complicated international problem even though be determine continuously to strive toward that ideal but be sure that under the agreement reach at yalta there will be a more stable political europe than ever before of course once there have be a free expression of the people 's will in any country immediate responsibility ends- with the exception only of such action as may be agree on in the|international|security|organization that hope to set up the|united|nation must also soon begin to help these liberate area adequately to reconstruct economy so that be ready to resume place in the world the nazi war machine have strip of raw material and machine tool and truck and locomotive have leave the industry of these place stagnant and much of the agricultural area be unproductive the nazis have leave a ruin in wake to start the wheel run again be not a mere matter of relief be to the national interest that all of see to that these liberate area be again make self support and productive so that do not need continuous relief from should say that be an argument base on plain common sense outstanding example of joint action by the major allied power in the liberated area be the solution reach on poland the whole polish question be a potential source of trouble in postwar europe — be have be sometimes before and come to the conference determine to find a common ground for solution and do — even though everybody do not agree with obviously objective be to help to create a strong independent and prosperous nation that be the thing must always remember those word agree to by russia by britain and by the|united|state the objective of make poland a strong independent and prosperous nation with a government ultimately to be select by the polish people to achieve that objective be necessary to provide for the formation of a new government much more representative than have be possible while poland be enslave there be as know government in london in lublin — practically in russia accordingly step be take at yalta to reorganize the exist provisional|government in poland on a broad democratic basis so as to include democratic leader now in poland and those abroad this new reorganize government will be recognize by all of as the temporary government of poland poland need a temporary government in the bad way an ad interim government think be another way of put however the new polish|provisional|government|of|national|unity will be pledge to hold a free election as soon as possible on the basis of universal suffrage and a secret ballot throughout history poland have be the corridor through which attack on russia have be make twice in this generation germany have strike at russia through this corridor to insure european security and world peace a strong and independent poland be necessary to prevent that from happen again the decision with respect to the boundary of poland be frankly a compromise do not agree with all of by any mean but do not go as far as britain want in certain area do not go so far as russia want in certain area and do not go so far as want in certain area be a compromise the decision be however under which the poles will receive compensation in territory in the north and west in exchange for what lose by the|curzon|line in the east the limit of the western border will be permanently fix in the final peace conference know roughly that will include in the new strong poland quite a large slice of what now be call germany and be agree also that the new poland will have a large and long coast line and many new harbor also that most of east|prussia will go to poland a corner of will go to russia also that the anomaly of of danzig will come to an end think danzig would be a lot well if be polish be well know that the people east of the|curzon|line — just for example here be why compromise be predominantly white russian and ukrainian be not polish and a very great majority of the people west of the line be predominantly polish except in that part of east|prussia and eastern germany which will go to the new poland as far back as representative of the allies agree that the|curzon|line represent a fair boundary between the people and must remember also that there have not be any polish government before for a great many generation be convince that the agreement on poland under the circumstance be the most hopeful agreement possible for a free independent and prosperous polish state the crimea conference be a meeting of the major military power on whose shoulder rest chief responsibility and burden of the war although for this reason france be not a participant in the conference no one should detract from the recognition that be accord there of role in the future of europe and the future

those who by international conference and united action have begin to build that kind of common understanding and cooperative experience which will be so necessary in the world to come will also decide these people of whether will entrust the task of postwar reconversion to those who offer the veteran of the last war breadline and apple selling and who finally lead the american people down to the abyss of or whether will leave to those who rescue american business agriculture industry finance and labor in and who have already plan and put through much legislation to help veteran resume

and last peace among and with all nation view transcript transcript ladies and gentlemen all fight man overseas today have appoint station on the far flung battlefront of the world at home have our too need and be proud of fight man most decidedly but during the anxious time ahead let not forget that need too go almost without say that must continue to forge the weapon of victory the|hundreds|of|thousand of item large and small essential to the waging of the war this have be the major task from the very start and be still a major task this be the very bad time for any war worker to think of leave machine or to look for a peacetime job and go almost without say too that must continue to provide government with the fund necessary for wag war not only by the payment of taxis which after all be an obligation of american citizenship but also by the purchase of an act of free choice which every citizen have to make for under the guidance of own conscience whatever else any of may be do the purchase of and stamp be something all of can do and should do to help win the war be happy to report tonight that be something which something nearly everyone seem to be do

there be remind of the fact that after the fall of france in ask the congress for the money for the production by the|united|state of fifty|thousand airplane per year well be call crazy be say that the figure be fantastic that could not be do and yet today be build airplane at the rate of one|hundred|thousand a year there be a direct connection between the bond have buy and the stream of man and equipment now rush over the|english|channel for the liberation of europe there be a direct connection between war)|bonds and every part of this global war today tonight therefore on the opening of this fifth war loan drive be appropriate for to take a broad look at this panorama of world war for the success or the failure of the drive be go to have so much to do with the speed with which can accomplish victory and the peace while know that the chief interest tonight be center on the|english|channel and on the beach and farm and the city of normandy should not lose sight of the fact that armed force be engage on other battlefront all over the world and that no front can be consider alone without proper relation to all be worth while therefore to make over all comparison with the past let compare today with just|two|years|ago|--|june,|1942 at that time germany be in control of practically all of europe and be steadily drive the russians back toward the|ural|mountain germany be practically in control of north|africa and the mediterranean and be beat at the gate of the|suez|canal and the route to india italy be still an important military and supply factor as subsequent long

beleaguered japanese troop who now face starvation or ultimate surrender and have cut down naval strength so that for many|months have avoid all risk of encounter with naval force true still have a long way to go to tokyo but carry out original strategy of eliminate european enemy first and then turn all strength to the pacific can force the japanese to unconditional surrender or to national suicide much more rapidly than have be think possible turn now to enemy who be first on the list for destruction have back against the wall in fact wall at once in the south have break the german hold on central italy on june|fourth the city of rome fall to the allied army and allow the enemy no respite the allies be now press hard on the heel of the germans as retreat northward in ever grow

of careful planning and strenuous preparation millions|of|ton of weapon and supply and hundreds|of|thousand of man assemble in england be now be pour into the great battle in europe think that from the standpoint of enemy have achieve the impossible have break through supposedly impregnable wall in northern|france but the assault have be costly in man and costly in material some of landing be desperate adventure but from advice receive so far the loss be low than commander have estimate would occur have establish a firm foothold and be now prepared to meet the inevitable counter - attack of the germans with power and with confidence and all pray that will have far more soon than a firm foothold americans have all work together to make this day possible the liberation force now stream across the channel and up the beach and through the field and the forest down the highway of france be use thousands|and|thousand of plane and ship and tank and heavy gun be carry with many thousand of item need for dangerous stupendous undertaking there be a shortage of nothing nothing and this must continue what have be do in the|united|state since those day of when france fall in raise and equip and transport fighting force and in produce weapon and supply for war have be nothing short of a miracle be largely due to american teamwork teamwork among capital and labor and agriculture between the armed force and the civilian economy indeed among all of and every every man or woman or child who buy a|war|bond help and help mightily there be still many people in the|united|state who have not buy war|bonds or who have not buy as many as can afford everyone know for whether fall into that category or not in some case neighbor know too also to the conscience of those people this appeal by the president of the|united|state be very much in order for all of the thing which use in this war everything send to fight allies cost money a lot of money sure way every man woman and child can keep faith with those who have give and be give life be to provide the money which be need to win the final victory urge all americans to buy war|bond without stint swell the mighty chorus to bring nearer to victory view transcript transcript friend yesterday on june|fourth,|1944 rome fall to american and allied troop the first of the axis capital be now in hand up and to go be perhaps significant that the first of these capital to fall should have the long history of all of the story of rome go back to the time of the foundation of civilization can still see there monument of the time when rome and the romans control the whole of the then know world that too be significant for the|united|nation be determine that in the future no city and no race will be able to control the whole of the world in addition to the monument of the old time also see in rome the great symbol of christianity which have reach into almost every part of the world there be other shrine and other church in many place but the church and shrine of rome be visible symbol of the faith and determination of the early saint and martyr that christianity should live and become universal and tonight now will be a source of deep satisfaction that the freedom of the pope and the of vatican|city be assure by the army of the|united|nation be also significant that rome have be liberate by the armed force of many nation the american and british army who bear the chief burden of battle find at side own north|american neighbor the gallant canadians the fight new zealanders from the far south|pacific the courageous french and the|french|moroccans the|south|african the poles and the|east|indian all of fight with on the bloody approach to the city of rome the italians too forswear a partnership in the axis which never desire have send troop to join in battle against the german trespasser on soil the prospect of the liberation of rome mean enough to hitler and general to induce to fight desperately at great cost of man and material and with great sacrifice to crumble eastern line and to western front no thank be due to if rome be spare the devastation which the germans wreak on naples and other italian city the|allied|general maneuver so skillfully that the nazis could only have stay long enough to damage rome at the risk of lose army but rome be of course more than a military objective ever since before|the|day of the caesars rome have stand as a symbol of authority rome be the|republic rome be the|empire rome be and be in a sense the|catholic|church and rome be the capital of a|united|italy later unfortunately a|quarter|of|a|century|ago rome become the seat of fascism of the capital of the axis for this a)|quarter|century the italian people be enslave be and degrade by the rule of mussolini from rome will mark liberation with deep emotion in the north of italy the people be still dominate and threaten by the nazi overlord and fascist puppet somehow in the back of head still remember a name mussolini victory come at an excellent time while allied force be poise for another strike at western europe and while the army of other nazi soldier nervously await assault and in the meantime gallant russian|ally continue to make power feel more and more from a strictly military standpoint have long ago accomplish certain of the main objective of italian campaign the control of the island the major island the control of the sea lane of the mediterranean to shorten combat and supply line and the capture of the airport such as the great airport of foggia south of rome from which have strike tell blow on the continent the whole of the continent all the way up to the russian front would be unwise to inflate in own mind the military importance of the capture of rome shall have to push through a long period of great effort and fiercer fighting before get into germany the germans have retreat thousands|of|miles all the way from the gate of cairo through libya and tunisia and sicily and southern italy have suffer heavy loss but not great enough yet to cause collapse germany have not yet be drive to surrender germany have not yet be drive to the point where will be unable to recommence world conquest a generation hence therefore the victory still lie some distance ahead that distance will be cover in due time have no fear of that but will be tough and will be costly as have tell many many time in italy the people have live so long under the corrupt rule of mussolini that in spite of the tinsel at the top have see the picture of economic condition have grow steadily bad troop have find starvation malnutrition disease a deteriorate education and lower public health all by product of the fascist misrule the task of the allies in occupation have be stupendous have have to start at the very bottom assist local government to reform on democratic line have have to give bread to replace that which be steal out of mouth by the germans have have to make possible for the italians to raise and use own local crop have to help cleanse school of fascist trapping think the american people as a whole approve the salvage of these human being who be only now learn to walk in a new atmosphere of freedom some of may let thought run to the financial cost of essentially be what can call a form of relief and at the same time hope that this relief will be an investment for the future an investment that will pay dividend by eliminate fascism by and end any italian desire to start another war of aggression in the future and that mean that be dividend which justify such an investment because be additional support for world peace the italian people be capable of self government do not lose sight of virtue as a peace love nation remember the many century in which the italians be leader in the art and science enrich the life of all mankind remember the great son of the italian people galileo and marconi,|michelangelo and dante and incidentally that fearless discoverer who typify the courage of italy christopher|columbus italy can not grow in stature by seek to build up a great militaristic empire italian have be overcrowd within own territory but do not need to try to conquer the land of other people in order to find the breath of life other people may not want to be conquer in the past italians have come by the million into to have be welcome have prosper have become good citizen community and governmental leader be not italian americans be americans americans of italian descent the italians have go in great number to the other americas brazil and the argentine for example hundreds|and|hundreds|of|thousand of have go and to many other nation in every continent of the world give of industry and talent and achieve success and the comfort of good living and good citizenship italy should go on as a great mother nation contribute to the culture and the progress and the goodwill of all mankind and develop special talent in the art and craft and science and preserve historic and cultural heritage for the benefit of all people want and expect the help of the future italy toward last peace all the other nation oppose to fascism|and|nazism ought to should help to give italy a chance the germans after year of domination in rome leave the people in the|eternal|city on the verge of starvation and the british will do and be do everything can to bring relief anticipate the fall of rome make preparation to ship food supply to the city but of course should be bear in mind that the need be so great and the transportation requirement of army so heavy that improvement must be gradual but have already begin to save the life of the man woman and child of rome this think be an example of the efficiency of machinery of war the magnificent ability and energy of the american people in grow the crop build the merchant ship in make and collect the cargo in get the supply over thousands|of|mile of water and think ahead to meet emergency all this spell think an amazing efficiency on the part of armed force all the various agency work with and american industry and labor as a whole no great effort like this can be a|hundred|percent perfect but the batting average be very very high and so extend the congratulation and thank tonight of the american people to general alexander who have be in command of the whole italian operation to general clark and general leese of the fifth and the|eighth|armie to general|wilson the supreme|allied commander of the mediterranean theater to and general|dever american deputy to lieutenant general eaker to admirals|cunningham and hewitt and to all brave officer and man may god bless and watch over and over all of gallant fight man view transcript transcript today send annual message to the congress as require by the constitution have be custom to deliver these annual message in person and have be broadcast to the nation intend to follow this same custom this|year but like a great many other people have have the flu and although be practically recover doctor simply would not permit to leave the|white|house to go up to the capitol only a few of the newspaper of the|united|state can print the message in full and be anxious that the american people be give an opportunity to hear what have recommend to the congress for this very fateful year in history and the reason for those recommendation here be what say this nation in the|past|two|year have become an active partner in the world 's great war against human slavery have join with like minded people in order to defend in a world that have be gravely threaten with gangster rule but do not think that any of americans can be content with mere survival sacrifice that and ally be make impose upon all a sacred obligation to see to that out of this war and child will gain something well than mere survival be unite in determination that this war shall not be follow by another interim which lead to new disaster that shall not repeat the tragic error of ostrich isolationism when mr. hull go to moscow in october when go to cairo and teheran in november know that be in agreement with allies in common determination to fight and win this war there be many vital question concern the future peace and be discuss in an atmosphere of complete candor and harmony in the last war such discussion such meeting do not even begin until the shooting have stop and the delegate begin to assemble at the peace table there have be no previous opportunity for man to man discussion which lead to meeting of mind and the result be a peace which be not a peace and right here want to address a word or to some suspicious soul who be fearful that mr. hull or have make commitment for the future which may pledge this nation to secret treaty or to enact the role of a world santa|claus of course make some commitment most certainly commit to very large and very specific military plan which require the use of all ally force to bring about the defeat of enemy at the early possible time but there be no secret treaty or political or financial commitment the supreme objective for the future which discuss for each nation individually and for all the|united|nation can be sum up in word security and that mean not only physical security which provide safety from attack by aggressor mean also economic security social security moral security in a family of nation in the plain down to earth talk that have with the generalissimo and marshal|stalin and prime minister churchill be abundantly clear that be all most deeply interested in the resumption of peaceful progress by own people progress toward a well life all ally have learn by experience — bitter experience that real development will not be possible if be to be divert from purpose by repeat war or even threat of war the good interest of each nation large and small demand that all freedom love nation shall join together in a just and durable system of peace in the present world situation evidence by the action of germany and italy and japan unquestioned military control over the disturber of the peace be as necessary among nation as be among citizen in any community and an equally basic essential to peace — permanent peace be a decent standard of live for all individual man and woman and child in all nation freedom from fear be eternally link with freedom from want there be people who burrow — burrow through the nation like unseeing mole and attempt to spread the suspicion that if other nation be encourage to raise standard of living own american standard of living must of necessity be depress the fact be the very contrary have be show time and again that if the standard of living of any country go up so do purchase power and that such a rise encourage a well standard of live in neighboring country with whom trade that be just plain common sense and be the kind of plain common sense that provide the basis for discussion at moscow and cairo and teheran return from journeying must confess to a sense of be let down when find many evidence of faulty perspective here in washington the faulty perspective consist in over emphasize less problem and thereby under emphasize the first and great problem the overwhelming majority of people have meet the demand of this war with magnificent courage and a great deal of understanding have accept inconvenience have accept hardship have accept tragic sacrifice however while the majority go on about great work without complaint all know that a noisy minority maintain an uproar an uproar of demand for special favor for special group there be pest who swarm through the lobby of the congress and the cocktail bar of washington represent these special group as oppose to the basic interest of the nation as a whole have come to look upon the war primarily as a chance to make profit for at the expense of neighbor — profit in money or profit in term of political or social preferment such selfish agitation can be and be highly dangerous in wartime create confusion damage morale hamper national effort prolong the war in this war have be compel to learn how interdependent upon each other be all group and section of the whole population of america increase food cost for example will bring new demand for wage increase from all war worker which will in turn raise all price of all thing include those thing which the farmer have to buy increased wage or price will each in turn produce the same result all have a particularly disastrous result on all fix income group and hope will remember that all of in this government include represent the fixed income group just as much as represent business owner or worker or farmer this group of fix income people include teacher and clergy and policeman and fireman and widow and minor who be on fix income wife and dependent of soldier and sailor and old age pensioner and family add up to more|than|a|quarter of people have few or no high pressure representative at the capitol and in a period of gross inflation would be the bad sufferer let give an occasional thought if ever there be a time to subordinate individual or group selfishness for the national good that time be now disunity at home and bickering self seek partisanship stoppage of work inflation business as usual politic as usual luxury as usual and sometimes a failure to tell the whole truth these be the influence which can undermine the morale of the brave man ready to die at the front for here those who be do most of the complaining do not think that be deliberately strive to sabotage the national war effort be labor under the delusion that the time be past when must make prodigious sacrifice that the war be already win and can begin to slacken off but the dangerous folly of that point of view can be measure by the distance that separate troop from ultimate objective in berlin and tokyo — and by the sum of all the peril that lie along the way over confidence and complacency be among deadly of all enemy and that attitude on the part of anyone government or management or labor — can lengthen this war can kill american boy let remember the lesson of in the|summer|of|that|year the tide turn in favor of the allies but this government do not relax nor do the american people in fact nation ’s effort be step up in august,|1918 the draft age limit be broaden from to all the way to 18|to|45 the president call for force to the utmost and call be heed and in november only|three|months|later germany surrender that be the way to fight and win a war all out and not with half an eye on the battlefront abroad and the other eye and a half on personal selfish or political interest here at home therefore in order to concentrate all of energy all of resource on win this war and to maintain a fair and stable economy at home recommend that the congress adopt first a realistic and simplified tax law which will tax all unreasonable profit both individual and corporate and reduce the ultimate cost of the war to son and daughter the tax bill now under consideration by the congress do not begin to meet this test secondly a continuation of the law for the renegotiation of war contract which will prevent exorbitant profit and assure fair price to the government for two|long|years have plead with the congress to take undue profit out of war third a cost of food law which will enable the government to place a reasonable floor under the price the farmer may expect for production and to place a ceiling on the price the consumer will have to pay for the necessary food buy this should apply as have intimate to necessity only and this will require public fund to carry out will cost in appropriation about|one|percent of the present annual cost of the war fourth an early re - enactment of the stabilization statute of october|1942 this expire this|year june|30,|1944 and if be not extend well in advance the country may just as well expect price chaos by summertime can not have stabilization by wishful thinking must take positive action to maintain the integrity of the american dollar and fifth a national service law which for the duration of the war will prevent strike and with certain appropriate exception will make available for war production or for any other essential service every able bodied adult in this whole nation these measure together form a just and equitable whole would not recommend a national service law unless the other law be pass to keep down the cost of living to share equitably the burden of taxation to hold the stabilization line and to prevent undue profit the federal government already have the basic power to draft capital and property of all kind for war purpose on a basis of just compensation and as know have for three|year hesitate to recommend a national service act today however with all the experience have behind and with be convince of necessity although believe that and allies can win the war without such a measure be certain that nothing less than total mobilization of all resource of manpower and capital will guarantee an early victory and reduce the toll of suffering and sorrow and blood as some of adviser write the other day when the very life of the nation be in peril the responsibility for service be common to all man and woman in such a time there can be no discrimination between the man and woman who be assign by the government to defense at the battlefront and the man and woman assign to produce the vital material that be essential to successful military operation a prompt enactment of a|national|service|law would be merely an expression of the universality of this american responsibility believe the country will agree that those statement be the solemn truth national service be the most democratic way to wage a war like selective service for the armed force rest on the obligation of each citizen to serve nation to utmost where be best qualified do not mean reduction in wage do not mean loss of retirement and seniority right and benefit do not mean that any substantial number of war worker will be disturb in present job let this fact be wholly clear there be million of american man and woman who be not in this war at all that be not because do not want to be in but want to know where can best do share national service provide that direction know that all civilian war worker will be glad to be able to say many year hence to grandchild yes too be in service in the great war be on duty in an airplane factory and help to make hundred of fight plane the government tell that in do that be perform most useful work in the service of country be argue that have pass the stage in the war where national service be necessary but soldier and sailor know that this be not true be go forward on a long rough road and in all journey the last mile be the hard and be for that final effort for the total defeat of enemy that must mobilize total resource the national war program call for the employment of more people in than in and be conviction that the american people will welcome this win the war measure which be base on the eternally just principle of fair for fair for all will give people at home the assurance that be stand square behind soldier and sailor and will give enemy demoralize assurance that mean business that americans be on the march to rome and berlin and tokyo hope that the congress will recognize that although this be national service be an issue which transcend politic great power must be use for great purpose as to the machinery for this measure the congress should determine nature as long as be wholly non - partisan in makeup several allege reason have prevent the enactment of legislation which would preserve for soldier and sailor and marine the fundamental prerogative of citizenship in other word the right to vote no amount of legalistic argument can becloud this issue in the eye of these ten|million american citizen surely the signer of the constitution do not intend a document which even in wartime would be construe to take away the franchise of any of those who be fight to preserve the constitution soldier and sailor and marine know that the overwhelming majority of will be deprive of the opportunity to vote if the voting machinery be leave exclusively to the state under exist state law and that there be no likelihood of these law be change in time to enable to vote at the next election the army and navy have report that will be impossible effectively to administer different soldier vote law be the duty of the congress to remove this unjustifiable discrimination against the man and woman in armed force and to do just as quickly as possible be duty now to begin to lay the plan and determine the strategy more than the winning of the war be time to begin plan and determine the strategy for win a last peace and the establishment of an american standard of live higher than ever know before this republic have beginning and grow to present strength under the protection of certain inalienable political right among the right of free speech free press free worship trial by jury freedom from unreasonable search and seizure be right to life and liberty have come to a clear realization of the fact however that true individual freedom can not exist without economic security and independence necessitous man be not free man people who be hungry people who be out of a job be the stuff of which dictatorship be make in our|day these economic truth have become accept as self evident have accept so to speak a second bill|of|right under which a new basis of security and prosperity can be establish for all regardless of station or race or creed among these be the right to a useful and remunerative job in the industry or shop or farm or mine of the nation the right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation the right of farmer to raise and sell product at a return which will give and family a decent living the right of every business man large and small to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopoly at home or abroad the right of every family to a decent home the right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health the right to adequate protection from the economic fear of old age and sickness and accident and unemployment and finally the right to a good education all of these right spell security and after this war be win must be prepared to move forward in the implementation of these right to new goal of human happiness and well being america 's own rightful place in the world depend in large part upon how fully these and similar right have be carry into practice for all citizen for unless there be security here at home there can not be last peace in the world of the great american industrialist of day a man who have render yeoman service to country in this crisis — recently emphasize the grave danger of rightist reaction in this nation any clear think business man share that concern indeed if such reaction should develop — if history be to repeat and be to return to the so call normalcy of the then be certain that even though shall have conquer enemy on the battlefield abroad shall have yield to the spirit of fascism here at home ask the congress to explore the mean for implement this economic bill of right for be definitely the responsibility of the congress so to do and the country know many of these problem be already before committee of the congress in the form of propose legislation shall from time to time communicate with the congress with respect to these and further proposal in the event that no adequate program of progress be evolve be certain that the nation will be conscious of the fact fight man abroad and family at home — expect such a program and have the right to insist on be to demand that this government should pay heed rather than to the whine demand of selfish pressure group who seek to feather nest while young americans be die have often say that there be no front for america in this war there be only front there be line of unity that extend from the heart of people at home to the man of attack force in farth outpost when speak of total effort speak of the factory and the field and the mine as well as the battlefield speak of the soldier and the civilian the citizen and government

complex situation in the|far|east with personally be able not only to settle upon definite military strategy but also to discuss certain long range principle which believe can assure peace in the|far|east for many generation to come those principle be as simple as be fundamental involve the restoration of steal property to rightful owner and the recognition of the right of million of people in the|far|east to build up own form of self government without molestation essential to all peace and security in the pacific and in the rest of the world be the permanent elimination of the|empire|of|japan as a potential force of aggression never again must soldier and sailor and marine and other soldier sailor and marine be compel to fight from island to island as be fight so gallantly and so successfully today increasingly powerful force be now hammer at the japanese at many point over an enormous arc which curve down through the pacific from the aleutians to own army and navy air|force the australians and new|zealanders the dutch and the british land air and sea force be all form a band of steel which be slowly but surely close in on japan and on the mainland of asia under the generalissimo 's leadership the chinese ground and air force augment by american air force be play a vital part in start the drive which will push the invader into the sea follow out the military decision at cairo general marshall have just fly around the world and have have conference with general macarthur and admiral nimitz conference which will spell plenty of bad news for the japs in the not too far distant future meet in the generalissimo a man of great vision and great courage and a remarkably keen understanding of the problem of today and tomorrow discuss all the manifold military plan for strike at japan with decisive force from many direction and believe can say that return to chungking with the positive assurance of total victory over common enemy today and the|republic|of|china be close together than ever before in deep friendship and in unity of purpose after the cairo conference mr. churchill and go by airplane to teheran there meet with marshal|stalin talk with complete frankness on every conceivable subject connect with the winning of the war and the establishment of a durable peace after the war within three|day of intense and consistently amicable discussion agree on every point concern with the launching of a gigantic attack upon germany the russian army will continue stern offensive on germany 's eastern front the ally army in italy and africa will bring relentless pressure on germany from the south and now the encirclement will be complete as great american and british force attack from other point of the compass the commander select to lead the combine attack from these other point be general dwight|d.|eisenhower performance in africa in sicily and in italy have be brilliant know by practical and successful experience the way to coordinate air sea and land power all of these will be under control lieutenant general carl d. spaatz will command the entire american strategic bombing force operate against germany general|eisenhower give up command in the mediterranean to a british officer whose name be be announce by mr. churchill now pledge that new commander that powerful ground sea and air force in the vital mediterranean area will stand by side until every objective in that bitter theatre be attain both of these new commanders will have american and british subordinate commanders whose name will be announce to the world in a|few|day during the|last|two|day in at teheran marshal|stalin mr. churchill and look ahead ahead to the|days and month and year that which will follow germany 's defeat be unite in determination that germany must be strip of military might and be give no opportunity within the foreseeable future to regain that may the|united|nation have no intention to enslave the german people wish to have a normal chance to develop in peace as useful and respectable member of the european family but most certainly emphasize that word respectable for intend to rid once and for all of nazism and prussian militarism and the fantastic and disastrous notion that constitute the|"master|race do discuss international relationship from the point of view of big broad objective rather than detail but on the basis of what do discuss can say even today that do not think any insoluble difference will arise among russia great|britain and the|united|state in these conference be concern with basic principle principle which involve the security and the welfare and the standard of living or human being in country large and small to use an american and somewhat ungrammatical colloquialism may say that get along fine with marshal|stalin be a man who combine a tremendous relentless determination with a stalwart good humor believe be truly representative of the heart and soul of russia and believe that be go to get along very well with and the russian people very well indeed britain russia china and the|united|state and allies represent more|than|three quarter of the total population of the earth as long as these nation with great military power stick together in determination to keep the peace there will be no possibility of an aggressor nation arise to start another world war but those power must be unite with and cooperate with all the freedom love people of europe and asia and africa and the americas the right of every nation large or small must be respect and guard as jealously as be the right of every individual within own republic the doctrine that the strong shall dominate the weak be the doctrine of enemy and reject but at the same time be agree that if force be necessary to keep international peace international force will be apply for as long as may be necessary have be steady policy and be certainly a common sense policy that the right of each nation to freedom must be measure by the willingness of that nation to fight for freedom and today salute unseen allies in occupy country the underground resistance group and the army of liberation will provide potent force against enemy when the|day of the counter - invasion come through the development of science the world have become so much small that have have to discard the geographical yardstick of the past for instance through early history the atlantic and pacific|oceans be believe to be wall of safety for the|united|state time and distance make physically possible for example for and for the other american republics to obtain and maintain independence against infinitely strong power until recently very few people even military expert think that the|day would ever come when may have to defend pacific|coast against japanese threat of invasion at the outbreak of the first world|war relatively few people think that ship and shipping would be menace by german submarine on the high sea or that the german militarist would ever attempt to dominate any nation outside of central europe after the armistice in think and hope that the militaristic philosophy of germany have be crush and be full of the milk of human kindness spend the|next|twenty disarm while the germans whine so pathetically that the other nation permit and even help to rearm for too many|years live on pious hope that aggressor and warlike nation would learn and understand and carry out the doctrine of purely voluntary peace the well intentione but ill fat experiment of former|year do not work be hope that will not try again no that be put too weakly be intention to do all that humanly can as president and commander in chief to see to that these tragic mistake shall not be make again there have always be cheerful idiot in this country who believe that there would be no more war for if everybody in america would only return into home and lock front door behind assume that motif be of the high event have show how unwilling be to face the fact the overwhelming majority of all the people in the world want peace most of be fight for the attainment of peace not just a truce not just an armistice but peace that be as strongly enforce and as durable as mortal man can make if be willing to fight for peace now be not good logic that should use force if necessary in the future to keep the peace believe and think can say that the other great nation who be fight so magnificently to gain peace be in complete agreement that must be prepared to keep the peace by force if the people of germany and japan be make to realize thoroughly that the world be not go to let break out again be possible and hope probable that will abandon the philosophy of aggression the belief that can gain the whole world even at the risk of lose own soul shall have more to say about the cairo and teheran conference when make report to the congress in about|two|week ' time and on that occasion shall also have a great deal to say about certain condition here at home but today wish to say that in all travel at home and abroad be the sight of soldier and sailor and magnificent achievement which have give the great inspiration and the great encouragement for the future to the member of armed force to wife mother and father want to affirm the great faith and confidence that have in general marshall and in admiral king who direct all of armed might throughout the world upon fall the great responsibility of plan the strategy of determine when and where and when shall fight both of these man have already gain high place in american history place which will record in that history many evidence of military genius that can not be publish today some of man overseas be now spend third christmas far from home to and to all other overseas or soon to go overseas can give assurance that be the purpose of government to win this war and to bring home at the early possible

security and employment and business enterprise under the free american system and that will find a government which by vote as american citizen have have a full share in elect the american people have have every reason to know that this be a tough and destructive war on trip abroad talk with many military man who have face enemy in the field these hard head realist testify to the strength and skill and resourcefulness of the enemy general and man whom must beat before final victory be win the war be now reach the stage where shall all have to look forward to large casualty list dead wound and missing war entail just that there be no easy road to victory and the end be not yet in sight have be back only for a|week be fair that should tell impression think see a tendency in some of people here to assume a quick ending of the war that have already gain the victory and perhaps as a result of this false reasoning think discern an effort to resume or even encourage an outbreak of partisan thinking and talking hope be wrong for surely first and most foremost task be all concerned with win the war and win a just peace that will last for generation the massive offensive which be in the making both in europe and will require every ounce of energy and fortitude that and allies can summon on the fighting front and in all the workshop at home as have say before can not order up a

do not and must not stop for single instant fight man know that those of who be move forward through jungle against lurk japs those who be in land at this moment in barge move through the dawn up to strange enemy coast those who be dive bomber down on the target at roof top level at this moment every of these man know that this war be a full time job and that will continue to be that until total

in the sky all over the world now be up to to prove to that be contribute share and more than share be not sufficient to simply to put money into war|bonds money which would normally save must put money into war|bonds money which would not normally save only then have do everything that good conscience demand so be up to up to the americans in the american home the very home which son and daughter be work and fighting and die to preserve know speak for every man and woman throughout the americas when say that americans will not be satisfied to send troop into the fire of the enemy with equipment inferior in any way nor will be satisfied to send troop with equipment only equal to that of the enemy be determined to provide troop with overpower superiority superiority of quantity quality and quality quantity in any and every category of arm and armament that may conceivably need and where do this dominate power come from why can come only from the money lend and the money give in taxis buy that death deal and at the same time life save power that need for victory this be an expensive war expensive in money can help can help to keep at a minimum cost in life the american people will never stop to reckon the cost of redeem civilization know there never can be any economic justification for fail to save freedom and can be sure that enemy will watch this drive with the keen interest know that success in this undertaking will shorten the war know that the more money the american people lend to government the more powerful and relentless will be the american force in the field know that only a united and determine america could possibly produce on a voluntary basis so huge large a sum of money as fifteen|billion|dollar the overwhelming success of the second war

not tell how much to invest in during this third war loan drive no one can tell be for to decide under the guidance of own conscience will say this however because the nation 's need be great than ever before sacrifice too must be great than have ever be before nobody know when total victory will come but do know that the harder fight now the more might and power direct at the enemy now the short the war will be and the small the sum total of sacrifice success of the|third|war|loan will be the symbol that america do not propose to rest on arm that know the tough bitter job ahead and will not stop until have finish now be turn every dollar that invest in the|third|war|loan be personal message of defiance to common enemy to the ruthless savage militarist of germany and japan and be personal message of faith and good cheer to allies and to all the man at the front god bless view transcript transcript fellow americans over a|year|and|a|half|ago say this to the congress the militarist in berlin and rome and tokyo start this war but the mass anger force of common humanity will finish today that prophecy be in the process of be fulfil the massed angered force of common humanity be on the march be go forward on the russian front in the vast pacific area and into europe converge upon ultimate objective berlin and tokyo think the first crack in the axis have come the criminal corrupt fascist regime in italy be go to piece the pirate philosophy of the fascists and the nazis can not stand adversity the military superiority of the|united|nation on sea and land and in the air have be apply in the right place and at the right time hitler refuse to send sufficient help to save mussolini in fact hitler 's troop in sicily steal the italians ' motor equipment leave italian soldier so strand that have no choice but to surrender once again the germans betray italian ally as have do time and time again on the russian front and in the long retreat from egypt through libya and tripoli to the final surrender in tunisia and so mussolini come to the reluctant conclusion that the jig be up could see the shadow of the long arm of justice but and fascist gang will be bring to book and punish for crime against humanity no criminal will be allow to escape by the expedient of resignation so term to italy be still the same as term to germany and japan --"unconditional surrender will have no truck with fascism in any way in any shape or manner will permit no vestige of fascism to remain eventually italy will reconstitute will be the people of italy who will do that choose own government in accordance with the basic democratic principle of liberty and equality in the meantime the|united|nation will not follow the pattern set by mussolini and hitler and the japanese for the treatment of occupy country pattern of pillage and starvation be already help the italian people in sicily with cordial cooperation be establish and maintain security and order be dissolve the organization which have keep under fascist tyranny be provide with the necessity of life until the time come when can fully provide for indeed the people in sicily today be rejoice in the fact that for the first time in year be permit to enjoy the fruit of own labor(s can eat what grow instead of have steal from by the fascists and the nazis in every country conquer by the nazis and the fascists or the japanese militarist the people have be reduce to the status of slave or chattel be determination to restore these conquer people to the dignity of human being master of own fate entitle to freedom of speech freedom of religion freedom from want and freedom from fear have start to make good on that promise be sorry if step on the toe of those americans who play party politic at home call that kind of foreign policy crazy altruism and starry eyed dreaming meanwhile the war in sicily and italy go on must go on and will go on until the italian people realize the futility of continue to fight in a lose cause a cause to which the people of italy never give wholehearte approval and support be a|little|over|a|year since plan the north|african campaign be six|month since plan the sicilian campaign confes that be of an impatient disposition but think that understand and that most people understand the amount of time necessary to prepare for any major military or naval operation can not just pick up the telephone and order a new campaign to start the|next|week for example behind the invasion force in of north|africa the invasion force that go out of north|africa be thousand of ship and plane guard the long perilous sea lane carry the man carry the equipment and the supply to the point of attack and behind all these be the railroad line and the highway here back home that carry the man and the munition to the port of embarkation there be the factory and the mine and the farm here back home that turn out the material there be the training camp here back home where the man learn how to perform the strange and difficult and dangerous task which be to meet on the beach and in the desert and in the mountain all this have to be repeat first in north|africa and then in in the attack on sicily here the factor in sicily the factor of air attack be add for could use north|africa as the base for soften up the landing place and line of defense in sicily and the line of supply in italy be interesting for to realize that every fly fortress that bomb harbor installation at for example naples bomb from base in north|africa require of gasoline for each single mission and that this be the equal of about|375 a ration ticket enough gas to drive car time across this continent will better understand part in the war and what gasoline ration mean if multiply this by the gasoline need of thousand of plane and hundreds|of|thousand of jeep and truck and tank that be now serve overseas think that the personal convenience of the individual or the individual family back home here in the|united|state will appear somewhat less important when tell that the initial assault force on sicily involve ship which carry man americans british canadians and french together with vehicle tank and gun and this initial force be follow every day and every night by thousand of reinforcement the meticulous care with which the operation in sicily be plan have pay dividend for casualty in man in ship and material have be low in fact far below estimate and all of be proud of the superb skill and courage of the officer and man who have conduct and be conduct those this operation the tough resistance develop on the front of the|british|eighth|army which include the canadians but that be no new experience for that magnificent fighting force which have make the germans pay a heavy price for each|hour of delay in the final victory the|american|seventh|army after a stormy landing on the expose beach of southern|sicily sweep with record speed across the island into the capital at palermo for many of troop this be first battle experience but have carry like veteran and must give credit for the coordination of the diverse force in the field and for the planning of the whole campaign to the wise and skillful leadership of general|eisenhower admiral cunningham general alexander and sir marshal|tedder have be tower of strength in handle the complex detail of naval and ground and air activity have hear some people say that the british and the americans can never get along well together have hear some people say that the army and the navy and the|air|forces can never get along well together that real cooperation between be impossible tunisia and sicily have give the lie once and for all to these narrow minded prejudice the dauntless fighting spirit of the british people in this war have be express in the historic word and deed of winston|churchill and the world know how the american people feel about ahead of be much big fight and allies will go into as go into sicily together and shall carry on together today production of ship be almost unbelievable this|year be produce over nineteen|million|ton of merchant shipping and next|year production will be over one|million|tons and in addition to shipment across the atlantic must realize that in this war be operate in the aleutians in the distant part of the|southwest|pacific in india and off the shore of for several|month have be lose few ship by sinking and have be destroy more and more u boat hope this will continue but can not be sure must not lower guard for single instant an example a tangible result of great increase in merchant shipping which think will be good news to civilian at home be that tonight be able to terminate the rationing of coffee and also expect that within a short time shall get greatly increase allowance of sugar those few americans who grouse and complain about the inconvenience of life here in the|united|state should learn some lesson from the civilian population of allies britain and china and russia and of all the land occupy by common enemy enemy the heavy and most decisive fighting today be go on in russia be glad that the british and have be able to contribute somewhat to the great striking power of the russian army in the russians be able to retire without break to move many of war plant from western russia far into the interior to stand together with complete unanimity in the defense of homeland the success of the russian army have show that be dangerous to make prophecy about a fact which have be forcibly bring home to that mystic master of strategic intuition herr|hitler the short live german offensive launch early|this|month be a desperate attempt to bolster the morale of the german people the russians be not fool by this go ahead with own plan for attack plan which coordinate with the whole united|nation ' offensive strategy the world have never see great devotion determination and self sacrifice than have be display by the russian people and army under the leadership of marshal|joseph|stalin with a nation which in save be thereby help to save all the world from the nazi menace this country of should always be glad to be a good neighbor and a sincere friend in the world of the future in the pacific be push the japs around from the aleutians to new|guinea there too have take the initiative and be not go to let go of become clear and clear that the attrition the whittling down process against the japanese be work the japs have lose more plane and more ship than have be able to replace the continuous and energetic prosecution of the war of attrition will drive the japs back from over extended line run from burma and siam and the straits settlement and siam through the|netherlands|indy to eastern new|guinea and the solomons and have good reason to believe that shipping and air power can not support such outpost naval and land and air strength in the pacific be constantly grow and if the japanese be base future plan for the pacific on a long period in which will be permit to consolidate and exploit conquer resource have well start revise plan now give that to merely as a helpful suggestion be deliver plane and vital war supply for the heroic army of generalissimo|chiang|sai shek and must do more at all cost air supply line from india to china across enemy territory continue despite attempt japanese interference have seize the initiative from the japanese in the air over burma and now enjoy superiority be bomb japanese communication supply dump and basis in china in indo china in and burma but be still far from main objective in the war against japan let remember however how far be a|year|ago from any of objective in the european theatre be push forward to occupation of position which in time will enable to attack the japanese islands from the north from the south from the east and from the west have hear say that while be succeed greatly on the fighting front be fail miserably on the home front think this be another of those immaturity a false slogan easy to state but untrue in the essential fact for the long this war go on the clear become that no one can draw a blue pencil down the middle of a page and call side the fighting front and the other side the home front for the of be inexorably tie together every combat division every naval task force every squadron of fighting plane be dependent for equipment and ammunition and fuel and food as indeed be for manpower dependent on the american people in civilian clothe in the office and in the factory and on the farm at home the same kind of careful planning that gain victory in north|africa and sicily be require if be to make victory an endure reality and do share in build the kind of peaceful world that which will justify the sacrifice make in this war the|united|nation be substantially agree on the general objective for the post - war world be also agree that this be not the time to engage in an international discussion of all the term of peace and all the detail of the future let win the war first must not relax pressure on the enemy by take time out to define every boundary and settle every political controversy in every part of the world the important thing the all important thing now be to get on with the war and to win while concentrate on military victory be not neglect the planning of the thing to come the freedom which know will make for more decency and great justice throughout the world among many other thing be today lay plan for the return to civilian life of gallant man and woman in the armed service must not be demobilize into an environment of inflation and unemployment to a place on a bread line or on a corner selling apple must this time have plan ready instead of wait to do a hasty inefficient and ill consider job at the last moment have assure man in the armed force that the american people would not let down when the war be win hope that the congress will help in carry out this assurance for obviously the|executive|branch|of|the|government can not do alone may the congress do duty in this regard the american people will insist on fulfil this american obligation to the man and woman in the armed force who be win this war for of course the return soldier and sailor and marine be a part of the problem of demobilize the rest of the|million of americans who have be work and live in a war economy since that large objective of reconvert wartime america to a peacetime basis be for which government be lay plan to be submit to the congress for action but the member of the armed force have be compel to make great economic sacrifice and every other kind of sacrifice than the rest of and be entitle to definite action to help take care of special problem the least to which be entitle seem to be something like this first muster out pay to every member of the armed force and merchant marine when or be honorably discharge muster out pay large enough in each case to cover a reasonable period of time between discharge and the finding of a new job secondly in case no job be find after diligent search then unemployment insurance if the individual register with the|united|states|employment|service third an opportunity for member of the armed service to get further education or trade training at the cost of the government fourth allowance of credit to all member of the armed force under unemployment compensation and federal old age and survivor ' insurance for period of service for these purpose ought to should be treat as if have continue employment in private industry fifth improved and liberalize provision for hospitalization for rehabilitation for and medical care of disabled member of the armed force and the merchant marine and finally sufficient pension for disabled member of the armed force government be draw up other serious constructive plan for certain immediate forward move concern food manpower and other domestic problem that but tie in with armed force within a|few|weeks shall speak with again in regard to definite action to be take by the|executive|branch of the government together with and specific recommendation for new legislation by the congress all calculation for the future however must be base on clear understanding of the problem involve and that can be gain only by straight thinking not guess work not or political manipulation confess that be sometimes bewilder by conflict statement that see in the press day read an authoritative statement that will shall win the war and the|next|day come another statement equally authoritative that the war will still be go on in of course both extreme of optimism and pessimism be wrong the length of the war will depend upon the uninterrupted continuance of all out effort on the fighting front and here at home and that the effort be all the american soldier do not like the necessity of wag war and yet if lay off for a single instant may lose own life and sacrifice the life of comrade by the same token a worker here at home may not like the driving wartime condition under which have to work and or live and yet if get complacent or indifferent and slack on job too may sacrifice the life of american soldier and contribute to the loss of an important battle the next time anyone say to that this war be in the bag or say and be all over but the shouting should ask these question be work full time on job be grow all the food can be buy limit of war bond be loyally and cheerfully cooperate with government in prevent inflation and profiteering and in make ration work with fairness to all because if answer be no then the war be go to last a lot long than think the plan make for the knocking out of mussolini and gang have largely succeed but still have to knock out hitler and gang and tojo and gang no one of pretend that this will be an easy matter still have to defeat hitler and tojo on own home ground but this will require a far great concentration of national energy and ingenuity and skill be not too much to say that must pour into this war the entire strength and intelligence and will power of the|united|state be a great nation a rich nation but be not so great or so rich that can afford to waste substance or the life or man by relax along the way shall not settle for less than total victory that be the determination of every american on the fighting front that must be and will be the determination of every american here at home view transcript transcript fellow americans be speak tonight to the american people and in particular to those of citizen who be coal miner tonight this country face a serious crisis be engage in a war on the successful outcome of which will depend the

this war shall need everything that have and everything that ally have to defeat the nazis and the fascists in the come battle on the|continent|of|europe and the japanese on the continent of asia and in the|islands|of|the|pacific this tremendous forward movement of the|united|state and the|united|nation can not be stop by enemy and equally must not be hamper by any individual or by the leader of any group here back home want to make clear that every american coal miner who have stop mining coal no matter how sincere motif no matter how legitimate may believe grievance to be every idle miner directly and individually be obstruct war effort have not yet win this war will win this war only as produce and deliver total american effort on the high sea and on the battlefront and that require unrelenting uninterrupted effort here on the home front a stopping of the coal supply even for a short time would involve a gamble with the life of american soldier and sailor and the future security of whole people would involve an unwarranted unnecessary and terribly dangerous gamble with chance for victory therefore say to all miner and to all americans everywhere at home and abroad the production of coal will not be stop tonight be speak to the essential patriotism of the miner and to the patriotism of wife and child and be go to state the true fact of this case as simply and as plainly as know how after the attack at pearl|harbor the great labor organization the|american|federation|of|labor the|congress|of|industrial|organization and the|railroad|brotherhood give the positive assurance that there would be no strike as long as the war last and the president of the|united|mine worker of america be a party to that assurance that pledge be applaud throughout the

agency create for this express purpose with the approval of organize labor the member of the board follow the usual practice which have prove successful in other dispute act promptly undertake to get all the fact of this the case from both the miner and the operator the national officer of the|united|mine|workers however decline to have anything to do with the fact finding of the|war|labor|board the only excuse that offer be that the|war|labor|board be prejudice the|war|labor|board have be and be ready to give this the case a fair and impartial hearing and have give assurance that if any adjustment of wage be make by the board will be make retroactive to april|first but the national officer of the|united|mine|workers refuse to participate in the hearing when ask to do so last|monday on wednesday of this|past|week while the board be proceed with the case stoppage begin to occur in some mine on thursday morning telegraph to the officer of the|united|mine|workers ask that the miner

the|united|mine|workers and not on but the consequence of this arbitrary action threaten all of everywhere at ten|o'clock yesterday morning saturday the government take over the mine call upon the miner to return to work for government the government need service just as surely as need the service of soldier and sailor and marine and the service of the million who be turn out the munition of war miner have son in the army and navy and marine|corps have son who at this|very|minute this split second may be fight in new|guinea or in or guadalcanal or tunisia or china or protect troop ship

quickly the father and mother of fighting man brother and sister and friend and that include all of be also in the line of duty the production line any failure in production may well result in costly defeat on the field of battle there can be no one among no faction powerful enough to interrupt the forward march of people to victory miner have ample reason to know that there be certain basic right for which this country stand and that those right be worth fight for and worth die for that be why have send son and brother from every mining town in the nation to join in the great struggle overseas that be why have contribute so generously so willingly to the purchase of war bond and to the many fund for the relief of war victim in foreign land that be why since this war be start in have increase the annual production of coal by a year the toughness of son in armed force be not surprising come of fine rugged stock man who work in the mine be not unaccustomed to hardship have be the objective of this government to reduce that hardship to obtain for miner and for all who do the nation 's work a well standard of living know only too well that the cost of living be trouble the miner ' family and trouble the family of million of other worker throughout the country as well a|year|ago become evident to all of that something have to be do about live cost government determine not to let the cost of living continue to go up as do in the first world|war government have be determine to maintain stability of both price and wage so that a dollar would buy so far as possible the same amount of the necessity of life and by necessity mean just that not the luxury not the and fancy good that have learn to do without in wartime so far have not be able to keep the price of some necessity as low as should have like to keep that be true not only in coal town but in many other place wherever find that price of essential have rise too high will be bring down wherever find that price ceiling be be violate the violator will be punish rent have be fix in most part of the country in many city have be cut to below where be before enter the war clothing price have generally remain stable these item make up more|than|a|third of the total budget of the worker 's family as for food which today account for about another a third of the family expenditure on the average want to repeat again government will continue to take all necessary measure to eliminate unjustified and avoidable price increase and be today now take measure to roll back the price of meat the war be go to go on coal will be mine no matter what any individual think about the operation of factory power plant railroad will not be stop munition must move to troop and so under these circumstance be inconceivable that any patriotic miner can choose any course other than go back to work and mining coal the nation can not afford violence of any kind at the coal mine or in coal town have place authority for the resumption of coal mining in the hand of a civilian the secretary of the interior if become necessary to protect any miner who seek patriotically to go back and work then that miner must have and family must have and will have complete and adequate protection if become necessary to have troop at the mine mouth or in coal town for the protection of work miner and family those troop will be do police duty for the sake of the nation as a whole and particularly for the sake of the fight man in the army the navy and the marines son and mine who be fight common enemy all over the world understand the devotion of the coal miner to union know of the sacrifice have make to build up believe now as have all life in the right of worker to join union and to protect union want to make absolutely clear that this government be not go to do anything now to weaken those right in the coalfield every improvement in the condition of the coal miner of this country have have hearty support and do not mean to desert now but also do not mean to desert obligation and responsibility as president of the|united|state and commander in chief of the army and navy the first necessity be the resumption of coal mining the term of the old contract will be follow by the secretary of the interior if an adjustment in wage result from a decision of the|war|labor|board or from any new agreement between the operator and miner which be approve by the|war|labor|board that adjustment will be make retroactive to april|first in the message that deliver to the congress express conviction that the spirit of this nation be good since then have see troop in the caribbean area in basis on the coast of ally brazil and in north|africa recently have again see great number of fellow countryman soldier and civilian from to the mexican border and to the|rocky|mountain tonight in the fact of a crisis of serious proportion in the coal industry say again that the spirit or this nation be good know that the american people will not tolerate any threat offer to government by anyone believe the coal miner will not continue the strike against the government believe that the coal miner as americans will not fail to heed the clear call to duty like all other good americans will march shoulder to shoulder with armed force to victory tomorrow the stars and stripes will fly over the coal mine and hope that every miner will be at work under that flag view transcript transcript mr. vice president mr. speaker member of the 78th congress this|78th congress assemble in of the great moment in the history of the nation the|past|year be perhaps the most crucial for modern civilization the|coming|year will be fill with violent conflict yet with high promise of well thing must appraise the event of accord to relative importance must exercise a sense of proportion first in importance in the american scene have be the inspiring proof of the great quality of fighting man have demonstrate these quality in adversity as well as in victory as long as flag fly over this capitol americans will honor the soldier sailor and marine who fight first battle of this war against overwhelming odd the hero live and dead of wake|and|bataan|and|guadalcanal of and midway and the|north|atlantic convoy unconquerable spirit will live forever by far the large and most important development in the whole worldwide strategic picture of be the event of the long front in russia first the implacable defense of stalingrad and second the offensive by the russian army at various point that start in the latter part of november and which still roll on with great force and effectiveness the other major event of the|year be the series of japanese advance in the philippines the|east|indy malaya and burma the stopping of that japanese advance in the|mid pacific,|the south pacific and the|indian oceans the successful defense of by the british counterattack through egypt and libya the american british occupation of north|africa of continue importance in the|year|1942 be the unending and bitterly contest battle of the convoy route and the gradual passing of air superiority from the axis to the|united|nation the axis power know that must win the war in eventually lose everything do not need to tell that enemy do not win the war in in the pacific area most important victory in be the air and naval battle off midway|island that action be historically important because secure for use communication line stretch thousands|of|miles in every direction in place this emphasis on the|battle|of|midway be not unmindful of other successful action in the pacific in the air and on land and afloat especially those on the|coral|sea and new|guinea and in the|solomon|island but these action be essentially defensive be part of the delay strategy that characterize this phase of the war during this period inflict steady loss upon the enemy great loss of japanese plane and naval vessel transport and cargo ship as|early|as|one|year|ago set as a primary task in the war of the|pacific|a|day by day and week by week and month by month destruction of more japanese war material than japanese industry could replace most certainly that task have be and be be perform by fighting ship and plane and a large part of this task have be accomplish by the gallant crew of american submarine who strike on the other side of the pacific at japanese ship — right up at the very mouth of the harbor of yokohama know that as each|day go by japanese strength in ship and plane be go down and down and american strength in ship and plane be go up and up and so sometimes feel that the eventual outcome can now be put on a mathematical basis that will become evident to the japanese people when strike at own home island and bomb constantly from the air and in the attack against japan shall be join with the heroic people of china that great people whose ideal of peace be so closely akin to own even today be fly as much lend lease material into china as ever traverse the|burma|road fly over mountain high fly blind through sleet and snow shall overcome all the formidable obstacle and get the battle equipment into china to shatter the power of common enemy from this war china will realize the security the prosperity and the dignity which japan have seek so ruthlessly to destroy the period of defensive attrition in the pacific be draw to a close now aim be to force the japanese to fight last|year stop this|year intend to advance turn now to the european theater of war during this|past|year be clear that first task be to lessen the concentrated pressure on the russian front by compel germany to divert part of manpower and equipment to another theater of war after month of secret planning and preparation in the utmost detail an enormous amphibious expedition be embark for french north|africa from the|united|state and in literally hundred of ship reach objective with very small loss and have already produce an important effect upon the whole situation of the war have open to attack what mr. churchill well describe as the underbelly of the axis and have remove the always dangerous threat of an axis attack through west|africa against the|south|atlantic|ocean and the continent of south|america the well time and splendidly execute offensive from egypt by the british 8th army be a part of the same major strategy of the|united|nation great rain and appalling mud and very limited communication have delay the final battle of tunisia the axis be reinforce strong position but be confident that though the fighting will be tough when the final allied assault be make the last vestige of axis power will be drive from the whole of the south shore of the mediterranean any review of the|year|1942 must emphasize the magnitude and the diversity of the military activity in which this nation have become engage as speak to approximately|one|and|a|half|million of soldier sailor marine and flier be in service outside of continental limit all through the world merchant seaman in addition be carry supply to and to ally over every sea lane few americans realize the amazing growth of air strength though be sure enemy do day in and day out force be bomb the enemy and meet in combat on many different front in every part of the world and for those who question the quality of aircraft and the ability of flier point to the fact that in africa be shoot down enemy plane to every one lose and in the pacific and the|southwest|pacific be shoot down to pay great tribute the tribute of the|united|states|of|america to the fight man of russia and china and britain and the various member of the british commonwealth the million of man who through the year of this war have fight common enemy and have deny to the world conquest which seek pay tribute to the soldier and flier and seaman of other of the|united|nation whose country have be overrun by axis horde as a result of the allied occupation of north|africa powerful unit of the|french|army and navy be go into action be in action with the united|nation force welcome as ally and as friend join with those frenchmen who since the dark day of june have be fight valiantly for the liberation of stricken country pay tribute to the fight leader of ally to winston|churchill to joseph|stalin and to the generalissimo chiang|kai shek yes there be a very great unanimity between the leader of the|united|nation this unity be effective in plan and carry out the major strategy of this war and in build up and in maintain the line of supply can not prophesy can not tell when or where the|united|nation be go to strike next in europe but be go to strike and strike hard can not tell whether be go to hit in norway or through the low countries or in france or through sardinia or sicily or through the balkans or through poland — or at several point simultaneously but can tell that no matter where and when strike by land and the british and the russians will hit from the air heavily and relentlessly day in and day out shall heap ton upon ton of high explosive on war factory and utility and seaport hitler and mussolini will understand now the enormity of miscalculation that the nazis would always have the advantage of superior air power as do when bomb warsaw and rotterdam and london and coventry that superiority have go forever yes the nazis and the fascist have ask for and be go to get forward progress in this war have depend upon progress on the production front there have be criticism of the management and conduct of war production much of this self criticism have have a healthy effect have spur on have reflect a normal american impatience to get on with the job be the kind of people who be never quite satisfied with anything short of miracle but there have be some criticism base on guesswork and even on malicious falsification of fact such criticism create doubt and create fear and weaken total effort do not wish to suggest that should be completely satisfied with production progress today or next|month or ever but can report to with genuine pride on what have be accomplish in a|year|ago set certain production goal for and for some people include some expert think that have pull some big figure out of a hat just to frighten the axis but have confidence in the ability of people to establish new record and that confidence have be justify of course realize that some production objective would have to be change some of adjust upward and other downward some item would be take out of the program altogether and other add this be inevitable as gain battle experience and as technological improvement be make airplane production and tank production fall short numerically — stress the word numerically of the goal set a|year|ago nevertheless have plenty of reason to be proud of record for produce military plane more than the airplane production of germany italy and japan put together last|month in december produce military plane and the rate be rapidly rise furthermore must remember that as each|month pass by the average of type weigh more take more|man hour to make and have more striking power in tank production revise schedule and for good and sufficient reason as a result of hard experience in battle have divert a portion of tank produce capacity to a step up production of new deadly field weapon especially self propel artillery here be some other production figure in produce combat vehicle such as tank and self propel artillery in produce machine gun time great than production in and time great than total production during of participation in the first world|war produce anti - tank gun time great than production produce ten|and|a|quarter|billion round of small arm ammunition time great than production and time great than total production in the first world|war produce round of artillery ammunition time great than production and time great than total production in the first world|war think the arsenal of democracy be make good these fact and figure that have give will give no great aid and comfort to the enemy on the contrary can imagine that will give considerable discomfort suspect that hitler and tojo will find difficult to explain to the german and japanese people just why be that decadent inefficient democracy can produce such phenomenal quantity of weapon and munition and fighting man have give the lie to certain misconception which be an extremely polite word especially the one which hold that the various blocs or group within a free country can not forego political and economic difference in time of crisis and work together toward a common goal while have be achieve this miracle of production during the|past|year armed force have grow from a|little|over|2,000,000|to|7,000,000 in other word have withdraw from the labor force and the farm some|5,000,000 of young worker and in spite of this farmer have contribute share to the common effort by produce the great quantity of food ever make available during a|single|year in all history wonder be there any person among so simple as to believe that all this could have be do without create some dislocation in normal national life some inconvenience and even some hardship who can have hope to have do this without burdensome government regulation which be a nuisance to everyone include those who have the thankless task of administer all know that there have be mistake — mistake due to the inevitable process of trial and error inherent in do big thing for the first time all know that there have be too many complicated form and questionnaire know about that have have to fill some of out but be determined to see to that supply of food and other essential civilian good be distribute on a fair and just basis to rich and poor management and labor farmer and city dweller alike be determined to keep the cost of live at a stable level all this have require much information these form and questionnaire represent an honest and sincere attempt by honest and sincere official to obtain this information have learn by the mistake that have make experience will enable during the|coming|year to improve the necessary mechanism of wartime economic control and to simplify administrative procedure but do not intend to leave thing so lax that loophole will be leave for cheater for chiseler or for the manipulator of the black market of course there have be disturbance and inconvenience and even hardship and there will be many many more before finally win yes will not be an easy year for on the home front shall feel in many way in daily live the sharp pinch of total war fortunately there be only a few americans who place appetite above patriotism the overwhelming majority realize that the food send abroad be for essential military purpose for own and allied fighting force and for necessary help in area that occupy americans intend to do this great job together in common labor must build and fortify the very foundation of national unity confidence in one another be often amusing and be sometimes politically profitable to picture the|city|of|washington as a madhouse with the congress and the administration disrupt with confusion and indecision and general incompetence however what matter most in war be result and the pertinent fact be that after only|a|few|year of preparation and only|one|year of warfare be able to engage spiritually as well as physically in the total waging of a total war washington may be a madhouse but only in the sense that be the capital city of a nation which be fight mad and think that berlin and rome and tokyo which have such contempt for the obsolete method of democracy would now gladly use all could get of that same brand of madness and must not forget that achievement in production have be relatively no great than those of the russians and the british and the chinese who have develop own war industry under the incredible difficulty of battle condition have have to continue work through bombing and blackout and have never quit americans be in good brave company in this war and be play own honorable part in the vast common effort as spokesman for the united|states government and take off hat to those responsible for american production to the owner manager and supervisor to the draftsman and the engineer and to the worker man and woman in factory and arsenal and shipyard and mine and mill and forest and railroad and on highway take off hat to the farmer who have face an unprecedented task of feed not only a great nation but a great part of the world take off hat to all the loyal anonymous untire man and woman who have work in private employment and in government and who have endure rationing and other stringency with good humor and good will yes take off hat to all americans who have contribute so magnificently to common cause have seek to emphasize a sense of proportion in this review of the event of the war and the need of the war should never forget the thing be fight for but at this critical period of the war should confine to the large objective and not get bogge down in argument over method and detail and all the|united|nation want a decent peace and a durable peace in the|year between the end of the first world|war and the beginning of the second world|war be not live under a decent or a durable peace have reason to know that boy at the front be concern with broad aim beyond the winning of the war and thinking and opinion coincide with what most americans here back home be mull over know and know that would be inconceivable would indeed be sacrilegious — if this nation and the world do not attain some real last good out of all these effort and suffering and bloodshed and death the man in armed force want a lasting peace and equally want permanent employment for family and neighbor when be muster out at the end of the war two|years|ago speak in annual message of freedom the blessing of of —freedom of speech and freedom of religion be an essential part of the very life of this nation and hope that these blessing will be grant to all man everywhere the people at home and the people at the front be wonder a little about the third freedom freedom from want to mean that when be muster out when war production be convert to the economy of peace will have the right to expect full employment — full employment for and for all able bodied man and woman in america who want to work expect the opportunity to work to run farm store to earn decent wage be eager to face the risk inherent in system of free enterprise do not want a postwar america which suffer from undernourishment or slum or the dole want no get rich quick era of bogus prosperity which will end for in sell apple on a street corner as happen after the bursting of the boom in when talk with young man and young woman will find want to work for and for family consider that have the right to work and know that after the last war father do not gain that right when talk with young man and woman will find that with the opportunity for employment want assurance against the evil of all major economic hazard assurance that will extend from the cradle to the grave and this great government can and must provide this assurance have be tell that this be no time to speak of a well america after the war be tell be a grave error on part dissent and if the security of the individual citizen or the family should become a subject of national debate the country know where stand say this now to this 78th congress because be wholly possible that freedom from want the right of employment the right of assurance against life 's hazard will loom very large as a task of america during the|coming|two|year trust will not be regard as an issue but rather as a task for all of to study sympathetically to work out with a constant regard for the attainment of the objective with fairness to all and with injustice to none in this war of survival must keep before mind not only the evil thing fight against but the good thing be fight for fight to retain a great past and fight to gain a great future let remember too that economic safety for the america of the future be threaten unless a great economic stability come to the rest of the world can not make america an island in either a military or an economic sense hitlerism like any other form of crime or disease can grow from the evil seed of economic as well as military feudalism victory in this war be the first and great goal before victory in the peace be the next that mean strive toward the enlargement of the security of man here and throughout the world and finally strive for the fourth freedom freedom from fear be of little account for any of to talk of essential human need of attain security if run the risk of another|world|war in that be just plain common sense war grow in size in death and destruction and in the inevitability of engulf all nation in inverse ratio to the shrink size of the world as a result of the conquest of the air shudder to think of what will happen to humanity include if this war end in an inconclusive peace and another war break out when the baby of today have grow to fight age every normal american pray that neither nor son nor grandson will be compel to go through this horror again undoubtedly a few americans even now think that this nation can end this war comfortably and then climb back into an american hole and pull the hole in after but have learn that can never dig a hole so deep that would be safe against predatory animal have also learn that if do not pull the fang of the predatory animal of this world will multiply and grow in strength and will be at throat again once more in a short generation most americans realize more clearly than ever before that modern war equipment in the hand of aggressor nation can bring danger overnight to own national existence or to that of any other nation or island or continent be clear to that if germany and italy and japan — or any of — remain armed at the end of this war or be permit to rearm will again and inevitably embark upon an ambitious career of world conquest must be disarm and keep disarm and must abandon the philosophy and the teaching of that philosophy which have bring so much suffering to the world after the first world|war try to achieve a formula for permanent peace base on a magnificent idealism fail but by failure have learn that can not maintain peace at this stage of human development by good intention alone today the|united|nation be the mighty military coalition in all history represent an overwhelming majority of the population of the world bind together in solemn agreement that will not commit act of aggression or conquest against any of neighbor the|united|nation can and must remain united for the maintenance of peace by prevent any attempt to rearm in germany in japan in italy or in any other nation which seek to violate the tenth|commandment—"thou shalt not covet there be cynic there be skeptic who say can not be do the american people and all the freedom love people of this earth be now demand that must be do and the will of these people shall prevail the very philosophy of the axis power be base on a profound contempt for the human race if in the formation of future policy be guide by the same cynical contempt then should be surrender to the philosophy of enemy and victory would turn to defeat the issue of this war be the basic issue between those who believe in mankind and those who do not — the ancient issue between those who put faith in the people and those who put faith in dictator and tyrant there have always be those who do not believe in the people who attempt to block forward movement across history to force back to servility and suffering and silence the people have now gather strength be move forward in might and power and no force no combination of force no trickery deceit or violence can stop now see before the hope of the world a decent secure peaceful life for man everywhere do not prophesy when this war will end but do believe that this|year|of|1943 will give to the|united|nation a very substantial advance along the road that lead to berlin and rome and tokyo tell be within the realm of possibility that this 78th congress may have the historic privilege of help greatly to save the world from future fear therefore let all have confidence let redouble effort a tremendous costly long endure task in peace as well as in war be still ahead of but as face that continue task may know that the state of this nation be good the heart of this nation be sound — the spirit of this nation be strong the faith of this nation be eternal view transcript transcript fellow americans as know have recently come back from a trip of inspection of camp and training station and war factory the main thing that observe on this trip be not exactly news be the plain fact that the american people be united as never before in determination to do a job and to do well this whole nation of man woman and child be become great fighting force some of be soldier or sailor some of be civilian some of be fight the war in airplane five|mile above the continent of europe or the island of the pacific and some of be fight in mine deep doom in the earth of pennsylvania or montana a few of be decorate with medal for heroic achievement but all of can have that deep and permanent inner satisfaction that come from do the good know how each of play an honorable part in the great struggle to save democratic civilization whatever individual circumstance or opportunity -we be all in and spirit be good and americans and ally be go to win and do not let anyone tell anything different that be the main thing that see on trip around the country unbeatable spirit if the leader of germany and japan could have come along with and have see what see would agree with conclusion unfortunately be unable to make the trip with and that be reason why be carry war effort overseas to with every passing week the war increase in scope and intensity that be true in europe in africa in asia and on all the sea the strength of the|united|nation be on the upgrade in this war the axis leader on the other hand know by now that have already reach full strength and that steadily mount loss in man and material can not be fully replace germany and japan be already realize what the inevitable result will be when the total strength of the|united|nation hit at additional place on the earth 's surface of the principal weapon of enemy in the past have be use of what be call the|war|of|nerve have spread falsehood and terror have start everywhere have dupe the innocent have foment suspicion and hate between neighbor have aid and abet those people in other nation even include own whose word and deed be advertise from berlin and from tokyo as proof of disunity the great defense against all such propaganda of course be the common sense of the common people and that defense be prevail the|"war|of|nerve against the|united|nation be now turn into a boomerang for the first time the nazi propaganda machine be on the defensive begin to apologize to own people for the repulse of vast force at stalingrad and for the enormous casualty be suffer be compel to beg overwork people to rally weakened production even publicly admit for the first time that germany can be feed only at the cost of steal food from the rest of europe be proclaim that a second front be impossible but at the same time be desperately rush troop in all direction and string barbed wire all the way from the coast of finland and norway to the island of meanwhile be drive to increase the fury of atrocity the|united|nation have decide to establish the identity of those nazi leader who be responsible for the innumerable act of savagery as each of these criminal deed be commit be be carefully investigate and the evidence be be relentlessly pile up for the future purpose of justice have make entirely clear that the|united|nation seek no mass reprisal against the population of germany or italy or japan but the ring leader and brutal henchman must be name and apprehend and try in accordance with the judicial process of criminal law there be now million of americans in army camp in naval station in factory and in shipyard who be these million upon whom the life of country depend what be think what be doubt and what be hope and how be the work progress the commander in chief can not learn all of the answer to these question in washington and that be why make the trip do be very easy to say as some have say that when the president travel through the country should go with a blare of trumpet with crowd on the sidewalk with battery of reporter and photographer talk and pose with all of the politician of the land but have have some experience in this war and in the last war can tell very simply that the kind of trip take permit to concentrate on the work have to do without expend time meet all the demand of publicity and may add be a particular pleasure to make a tour of the country without have to give a single thought to politic expect to make other trip for similar purpose and shall make in the same way in the last war have see great factory but until see some of the new present day plant have not thoroughly visualize american war effort of course see only a small portion of all plant but that portion be a good cross - section and be deeply impressive the|united|state have be at war for only|ten|month and be engage in the enormous task of multiply armed force many time be by no mean at full production level yet but could not help ask on the trip where would be today if the|united|state have not begin to build many of factory for this huge increase more|than|a|year before war be force upon at pearl|harbor have also have to face the problem of shipping ship in every part of the world continue to be sink by enemy action but the total tonnage of ship come out of american canadian and british shipyard day by day have increase so fast that be get ahead of enemy in the bitter battle of transportation in expand shipping have have to enlist many thousand of man for these man be serve magnificently be risk life every|hour so that gun and tank and plane and ammunition and food may be carry to the heroic defender of stalingrad and to all the|united|nation ' force all over the world a|few|days|ago award the first maritime distinguished service medal to a young man edward|f.|cheney of yeadon pennsylvania who have show great gallantry in rescue comrade from the oily water of the sea after ship have be torpedo there will be many more such act of bravery in sense recent trip be a hurried one out through the|middle|w to the northwest down the length of the|pacific|coast and back through the southwest and the south in another sense however be a leisurely trip because have the opportunity to talk to the people who be actually do the work management and labor alike on own home ground and give a fine chance to do some thinking about the major problem of war effort on the basis of first thing first as tell the press association representative who accompany be impress by the large proportion of woman employ do skilled manual work labor running machine as time go on and many more of man enter the armed force this proportion of woman will increase within less|than|a|year|from|now think there will probably be as many woman as man work in war production plant have some enlightening experience relate to the old saying of man that curiosity inquisitiveness be strong among woman notice that frequently that when drive unannounced down the middle aisle of a great plant full of worker and machine the first people to look up from work be the man and not the woman be chiefly the man who be argue as to whether that fellow in the straw hat be really the president or not so have see the quality of the work and of the worker on production line and couple these firsthand observation with the report of actual performance of weapon on the fighting front can say to that be get ahead of enemy in the battle of production and of great importance to future production be the effective and rapid manner in which the congress meet the serious problem of the rise cost of living be a splendid example of the operation of democratic process in wartime the machinery to carry out this act of the congress be put into effect within twelve|hour after the bill be sign the legislation will help the cost of live problem of every worker in every factory and on every farm in the land in order to keep step up production have have to add million of worker to the total labor force of the nation and as new factory come into operation must find additional million of worker this present a formidable problem in the mobilization of manpower be not that do not have enough people in this country to do the job the problem be to have the right number of the right people in the right place at the right time be learn to ration material and must now learn to ration manpower the major objective of a sound manpower policy be first to select and train man of the high fighting efficiency need for armed force in the achievement of victory over enemy in combat second to man war industry and farm with the worker need to produce the arm and munition and food require by and by fight ally to win this war in order to do this shall be compel to stop worker from move from war job to another as a matter of personal preference to stop employer from steal labor from each other to use old man and handicap people and more woman and even grow boy and girl wherever possible and reasonable to replace man of military age and fitness to train new personnel for essential war work and to stop the wastage of labor in all non - essential activity there be many other thing that can do and do immediately to help meet the this manpower problem the school authority in all the state should work out plan to enable high school student to take some time from their|school|year and to use summer vacation to help farmer raise and harvest crop or to work somewhere in the war industry this do not mean closing school and stop education do mean give old student a well opportunity to contribute bit to the war effort such work will do no harm to the student people should do work as near home as possible can not afford to transport a single worker into an area where there be already a worker available to do the job in some community employer dislike to employ woman in other be reluctant to hire negroes in still other old man be not want can no longer afford to indulge such prejudice or practice every citizen want to know what essential war work can do the good can get the answer by apply to the near office there be four|thousand|five|hundr of these office throughout the nation be form the corner grocery store of manpower system this network of employment office be prepared to advise every citizen where skill and labor be need most and to refer to an employer who can utilize to good advantage in the war effort perhaps the most difficult phase of the manpower problem be the scarcity of farm labor in many place have see evidence of the fact however that the people be try to meet as well as possible in community that visit a perishable crop be harvest by turn out the whole of the high school for three|or|four|day and in another community of fruit grower the usual japanese labor be not available but when the fruit ripen the banker the butcher the lawyer the garage man the druggist the local editor and in fact every able bodied man and woman in the town leave occupation and go out gathering(ed the fruit and send to market every farmer in the land must realize fully that production be part of war production and that be regard by the nation as essential to victory the american people expect to keep production up and even to increase will use every effort to help to get labor but at the same time and the people of community must use ingenuity and cooperative effort to produce crop and livestock and dairy product may be that all of volunteer effort however well intentioned and well administer will not suffice wholly to solve the this problem in that case shall have to adopt new legislation and if this be necessary do not believe that the american people will shrink from in a sense every american because of the privilege of citizenship be a part of the|selective|service the nation owe a debt of gratitude to the|selective|service|board the successful operation of the|selective|service|system and the way have be accept by the great mass of citizen give confidence that if necessary the same principle could be use to solve any manpower problem and want to say also a word of praise and thank for to the more|than|ten|million people all over the country who have volunteer for the work of civilian defense and who be work hard at be display unselfish devotion in the patient performance of often tiresome and always anonymous task in do this important neighborly work be help to fortify national unity and real understanding of the fact that be all involve in this war naturally on trip be most interested in watch the training of fighting force all of combat unit that go overseas must consist of young strong man who have have thorough training a an army division that have an average age of three|or|twenty be a well fighting unit than which have an average age of or the more of such troop have in the field the sooner the war will be win and the small will be the cost in casualty therefore believe that will be necessary to lower the present minimum age limit for selective|service from twenty|years down to have learn how inevitable that be and how important to the speeding up of victory can very thoroughly understand the feeling of all parent whose son have enter armed force have an appreciation of that feeling and so have wife want every father and every mother who have a son in the service to know from what have see with own eye that the man in the army navy and marine|corps be receive today the good possible training equipment and medical care and will never fail to provide for the spiritual need of officer and man under the chaplains of armed service good training will save many many life in battle the high rate of casualty be always suffer by unit comprise of inadequately train man can be sure that the combat unit of army and navy be well man and well equip and well train effectiveness in action will depend upon the quality of leadership and upon the wisdom of the strategic plan on which all military operation be base can say thing about these plan of our be not be decide by the typewriter strategist who expound view in the press or on the radio of the great of american soldier robert|e.|lee once remark on the tragic fact that in the war of his|day all of the good general be apparently work on newspaper instead of in the army and that seem to be true in all war the trouble with the typewriter strategist be that while may be full of bright idea be not in possession of much information about the fact or problem of military operation therefore will continue to leave the plan for this war to the military leader the military and naval plan of the|united|state be make by the joint staff of the army and navy which be constantly in session in washington the chiefs of this staff be admiral leahy general marshall admiral king and general arnold meet and confer regularly with representative of the british joint staff and with representative of russia china the|netherlands poland norway the|british|dominion and other nation work in the common cause since this unity of operation be put into effect last|january there have be a very substantial agreement between these planner all of whom be train in the profession of arm air sea and land from their|early|years as commander in chief have at all time also be in substantial agreement as have say before many major decision of strategy have be make of on which have all agree relate to the necessity of divert enemy force from russia and china to other theater of war by new offensive against germany and japan an announcement of how these offensive be to be launch and when and where can not be broadcast over the radio at this time be celebrat(e) today the exploit of a bold and adventurous italian columbus who with the aid of spain open up a new world where freedom and tolerance and respect for human right and dignity provide an asylum for the oppress of the old world today the son of the new world be fight in land far distant from own america be fight to save for all mankind include the principle which have flourish in this new world of freedom be mindful of the countless million of people whose future liberty and whose very life depend upon permanent victory for the|united|nation there be a few people in this country who when the collapse of the axis begin will tell people that be safe once more that can tell the rest of the world to stew in own juice that never again will help to pull the other fellow 's chestnut from the fire that the future of civilization can jolly well take care of insofar as be concerned but be useless to win battle if the cause for which fight these battle be lose be useless to win a war unless stay win therefore fight for the restoration and perpetuation of faith and hope and peace throughout the world the objective of today be clear and realistic be to destroy completely the military power of germany italy and japan to such good purpose that threat against and all the other united|nation can not be revive a generation hence be united in seek the kind of victory that will guarantee that grandchild can grow and under gods may live life free from the constant threat of invasion destruction slavery and violent death view transcript transcript friend wish that all the americans people could read all the citation for various medal recommend for soldier and sailor and marine be pick out of these citation which tell of the accomplishment of lieutenant john|james|powers united|states|navy during three|day of the battle with japanese force in the|coral|sea during the|first|two|day lieutenant|power fly a dive bomber in the face of blast enemy anti - aircraft fire demolish large enemy gunboat put another gunboat out of commission severely damage an aircraft tender and a ton transport and score a direct hit on an aircraft carrier which burst into flame and sink soon after the official citation then describe of battle as the pilot of squadron leave the ready room to man plane lieutenant powers say to remember the folk back home be count on be go to get a hit if have to lay on flight deck lead section down to the target from an altitude of 18,000|feet through a wall of burst anti - aircraft shell and swarm of enemy plane dive almost to the very deck of the enemy carrier and do not release bomb until be sure of a direct hit be last see attempt recovery from dive at the extremely low altitude of two|hundred|feet amid a terrific barrage of shell and bomb fragment and smoke and flame and debris from the stricken vessel own plane be destroy by the explosion of own bomb but have make good promise to lay on the flight deck have receive a recommendation from the secretary of the navy that lieutenant john|james|powers of new|york|city miss in action be award hereby and now make this award and be the folk back home for whose protection lieutenant powers fight and repeatedly risk life say that count on and man do not count in vain but have not those man a right to be count on how be play part back home in win this war the answer be that be not do enough today send a message to the congress point out the overwhelming urgency of the serious domestic economic crisis with which be threaten some call inflation which be a vague sort of term and other call a rise in the cost of living which be much more easily understand by most family that phrase the cost of living mean essentially what a dollar can buy from january|1,|1941 to may|of|this|year the cost of living go up about|15 % and at that point last|may undertake to freeze the cost of living but could not do a complete job of because the congressional authority at the time exempt a large part of farm product use for food and for make clothing although several|weeks before have ask the congress for legislation to stabilize all farm price at that time have tell the congress that there be element in national economy all of which have to be control and that if any essential element remain exempt the cost of living could not be hold down on only|two of these point both of vital however do call for congressional action these vital point be first taxation and second the stabilization of all farm price at parity parity be a standard for the maintenance of good farm price be establish as national policy way back in mean that the farmer and the city worker be on the same relative ratio with each other in purchase power as be during a period some|thirty|years|(ago before at a time then the farmer have a satisfactory purchasing power of parity therefore have be accept by farmer as the fair standard for the price receive last|january however the congress pass a law forbid ceiling on farm price below of parity on some commodity and on other commodity the ceiling be even high so that the average possible ceiling be now about|116|percent of parity for agricultural product as a whole this act of favoritism for particular group in the community increase the cost of food to everybody not only to the worker in the city or in the munition plant and family but also to the family of the farmer since last|may ceiling have be set on nearly all commodity rent and service except the exempt farm product installment buying for example have be effectively effectually stabilize and control wage in certain key industry have be stabilize on the basis of the present cost of living but be obvious to all of however that if the cost of food continue to go up as be do at present the wage earner particularly in the low bracket will have a right to an increase in wage think that would be essential justice and a practical necessity experience with the control of other price during the|past|few|month have bring out important fact the rise cost of living can be control provide that all element make up the cost of living be control at the same time think that also be an essential justice and a practical necessity know that parity price for farm product not now control will not put up the cost of live more than a very small amount but also know that if must go up to an average of % of parity for food and other farm product which be necessary at present under the emergency price control act before can control all farm price the cost of living will get well out of hand be face to face with this danger today let meet and remove realize that may seem out of proportion to to be worry about over stress these economic problem at a time like this when be all deeply concerned about the news from far distant field of battle but give the solemn assurance that failure to solve this problem here at home and to solve now will make more difficult the winning of this war if the vicious spiral of inflation ever get under way the whole economic system will stagger price and wage will go up so rapidly that the entire production program will be endanger the cost of the war pay by taxpayer will jump beyond all present calculation will mean an uncontrollable rise in price and in wage which can result in raise the overall cost of live as high as another|20|percent soon that would mean that the purchasing power of every dollar that have in pay envelope or in the bank or include in insurance policy or pension would be reduce to about|eighty|cent worth need not tell that this would have a demoralizing effect on people soldier and civilian alike overall stabilization of price and salary and wage and profit be necessary to the continue increase production of plane and tank and ship and gun in message to congress today have tell the congress say that this must be do quickly if wait for two|or|three|or|four|or|six|months may well be too late have tell the congress that the administration can not hold the actual cost of food and clothing down to the present level beyond therefore have ask the congress to pass legislation under which the president would be specifically authorize to stabilize the cost of living include the price of all farm commodity the purpose should be to hold farm price at parity or at level of a recent date whichever be high the purpose should also be to keep wage at a point stabilize with today 's cost of living both must be regulate at the same time and neither of can or should be regulate without the other at the same time that farm price be stabilize will stabilize wage that be plain justice and plain common sense and so have ask the congress to take this action by the|first|of|october must now act with the dispatch which the stern necessity of war require have tell the congress that inaction on part by that date will leave with an inescapable responsibility a responsibility to the people of this country to see to that the war effort be no longer imperil by the threat of economic chaos as say in message to the congress in the event that the congress should fail to act and act adequately shall accept the responsibility and will act the president have the power under the constitution and under congressional acts to take measure necessary to avert a disaster which would interfere with the winning of the war have give the most careful and thoughtful consideration to meet this issue without further reference to the congress have determine however on this vital matter to consult with the congress there may be those who will say that if the situation be as grave as have state to be should use power and act now can only say that have approach this problem from every angle and that have decide that the course of conduct which be follow in this case be consistent with sense of responsibility as president in time of war and with deep and unalterable devotion to the process of democracy the responsibility of the president in wartime to protect the nation be very grave this total war with fighting front all over the world make the use of the executive power far more essential than in any previous war if be invade the people of this country would expect the president to use any and all mean to repel the invader now the revolution and the|war between the states be fight on own soil but today this war will be win or lose on other continent and in remote sea can not tell what power may have to be exercise in order to win this war the american people can be sure that will use power with a full sense of responsibility to the constitution and to country the american people can also be sure that shall not hesitate to use every power vest in to accomplish the defeat of enemy in any part of the world where own safety demand such defeat and when the war be win the power under which act will automatically revert to the people of the|united|state to the people to whom those power belong think know the american farmer know that be as wholehearte in patriotism as any other group have suffer from the constant fluctuation of farm price occasionally too high more often too low nobody know better than farmer the disastrous effect of wartime inflationary boom and post - war deflationary panic so have also suggest today suggest that the congress make agricultural economy more stable have recommend that in addition to put ceiling on all farm product now also place a definite floor under those price for a period begin now continue through the war and for as long as necessary after the war in this way will be able to avoid the collapse of farm price which that happen after the last war the farmer must be assure of a fair minimum price during the readjustment period which will follow the great excessive world food demand which that now prevail must have some floor under farm price as must have under wage if be to avoid the danger of a post - war inflation on the hand or the catastrophe of a crash in farm price and wage on the other today have also advise the congress of the importance of speed up the passage of the tax bill the|federal|treasury be lose millions|of|dollar each and every|day because the bill have not yet be pass taxation be the only practical way of prevent the income and profit of individual and corporation from get too high have tell the congress once more that all net individual income after payment of all taxis should be limit effectively by further taxation to a maximum net income of a year and be equally important that corporate profit should not exceed a reasonable amount in any case the nation must have more money to run the|war people must stop spend for luxury country need a far great share of income for this be a global war and will cost this nation nearly|one|hundred|billion|dollars in in that global war there be now main area of combat and should like to speak briefly of not in the order of importance for all of be vital and all of be interrelate the russian front here the germans be still unable to gain the smashing victory which almost|a|year|ago hitler announce have already achieve germany have be able to capture important russian territory nevertheless hitler have be unable to destroy a single russian|army and this may be sure have be and still be main objective million of german troop seem doom to spend another cruel and bitter winter on the russian front yes the russians be kill more nazis and destroy more airplane and tank than be be smash on any other front be fight not only bravely but brilliantly in spite of any setback russia will hold out and with the help of allies will ultimately drive every nazi from soil the|pacific|ocean|area this area must be group together as a whole part of land and sea have stop major japanese offensive and have inflict heavy loss on fleet but still possess great strength seek to keep the initiative and will undoubtedly strike hard again must not over rate the importance of success in the|solomon|island though may be proud of the skill with which these local operation be conduct at the same time need not under rate the significance of victory at midway there stop the major japanese offensive in the mediterranean and the|middle|east area the british together with the|south|african australians new|zealanders indian troop and other of the|united|nation include be fight a desperate battle with the germans and italians the axis power be fight to gain control of that area dominate the mediterranean and the|indian|ocean and gain contact with the|japanese|navy the battle in the|middle|east be now join be well aware of danger but be hopeful of the outcome the european area here the aim be an offensive against germany there be different point at which attack can be launch of course do not expect to give detail of future plan but can rest assure that preparation be be make here and in britain toward this purpose the power of germany must be break on the battlefield of europe various people urge that concentrate force on or another of these area although no one suggest that any of the area should be abandon certainly could not be seriously urge that abandon aid to russia or that surrender all of the pacific to japan or the mediterranean and middle|east to germany or give up an offensive against germany the american people may be sure that shall neglect none of the great theater of war certain vital military decision have be make in due time will know what these decision be and so will enemy can say now that all of these decision be direct toward take the offensive today exactly nine|months after pearl|harbor have send overseas time more man than transport to france in the|first|nine|months|of|the|first|world|war have do this in spite of great danger and few ship and every|week see a gain in the actual number of american man and weapon in the fighting area these reinforcement in man and munition be continue and will continue to go forward this war will finally be win by the coordination of all the army navy and air force of all of the united|nation operate in unison against enemy this will require vast assembly of weapon and man at all the vital point of attack and ally have work for year to achieve superiority in weapon have no doubt about the superiority of man glory in the individual exploit of soldier sailor marine merchant seamen lieutenant john|james|powers be of these and there be thousand of other in the force of the|united|nation americans have meet death in battle other thousand will lose life but many million stand ready to step into place to engage in a struggle to the very death for know that the enemy be determined to destroy home and institution that in this war be kill or be kill battle be not win by soldier or sailor who think first of own personal safety and war be not win by people who be concern primarily with own comfort own convenience own pocketbook americans of today bear the grave of responsibility and all of the united|nation share all of here at home be be test for fortitude for selfless devotion to country and to cause this be the tough war of all time need not leave to historian of the future to answer the question whether be tough enough to meet this unprecedented challenge can give that answer now the answer be yes view transcript transcript fellow americans be nearly|five|months since be attack at pearl|harbor for the|two|year prior to that attack this country have be gear up to a high level of production of munition and yet war effort have do little to dislocate the normal life of most of since then have dispatch strong force of army and navy several|hundred|thousand of to basis and battlefront thousands|of|miles from home have step up war production on a scale that be test industrial power and engineering genius and economic structure to the utmost have have no illusion about the fact that this would be be a tough job and a long american warship be now in combat in the|north|and|south|atlantic in the arctic in the mediterranean in the|indian|ocean and in the|north|and|south|pacific american troop have take station in south|america greenland iceland the|british|isles the|middle|east and the|far|east the|continent|of|australia and many island of the pacific american war plane man by americans be fly in actual combat over all the continent and all the ocean on the european front the most important development of the|past|year have be without question the crush counter - offensive on the part of the great army of russia against the powerful german army these russian force have destroy and be destroy more armed power of enemy troop plane tank and gun than all the other united|nation put together in the mediterranean area matter remain on the surface much as be but the situation there be receive very careful attention recently have receive news of a change in government in what use to know as the|republic|of|france name dear to the heart of all lover of liberty a name and an institution which hope will soon be restore to full dignity throughout the nazi occupation of france have hope for the maintenance of a|french|government which would strive to regain independence to reestablish the principle of liberty,|equality|and|fraternity and to restore the historic culture of france policy have be consistent from the very beginning however be now greatly concerned lest those who have recently come to power may seek to force the brave french people into submission to nazi despotism the|united|nation will take measure if necessary to prevent the use of french territory in any part of the world for military purpose by the axis power the good people of france will readily understand that such action be essential for the|united|nation to prevent assistance to the army or navy or air force of germany or italy and or japan the overwhelming majority of the french people understand that the fight of the|united|nation be fundamentally fight that victory mean the restoration of a free and independent france and the saving of france from the slavery which would be impose upon by external enemy and by internal traitor know how the french people really feel know that a deep seat determination to obstruct every step in the axis plan extend from occupy france through vichy france all the way to the people of colony in every ocean and on every continent plane be help in the defense of french colony today and soon american|flying|fortresse will be fight for the liberation of the darken continent of europe in all the occupy country there be man and woman and even little child who have never stop fight never stop resist never stop prove to the nazis that so call new order can will never be enforce upon free people in the german and italian people there be a grow conviction that the cause of nazi ism and fascism be hopeless that political and military leader have lead along the bitter road which lead not to world conquest but to final defeat can not fail to contrast the present frantic speech of these leader with arrogant boasting of a|year|ago and two|years|ago and on the other side of the world in the|far|east have pass through a phase of serious loss have inevitably lose control of a large portion of the|philippine|island but this whole nation pay tribute to the filipino and american officer and man who hold out so long on bataan|peninsula to those grim and gallant fighter who still hold corregidor where the flag fly and to the force which that be still strike effectively at the enemy on mindanao and other island the malayan peninsula and singapore be in the hand of the enemy the netherlands east indies be almost entirely occupy though resistance there continue many other island be in the possession of the japanese but there be good reason to believe that southward advance have be check australia new|zealand and much other territory will be basis for offensive action and be determined that the territory which that have be lose will be regain the japanese be press northward advance in against burma with considerable power drive toward india and china have be oppose with great bravery by small british and chinese force aid by american flier the news in burma tonight be not good the japanese may cut the|burma|road but want to say to the gallant people of china that no matter what advance the japanese may make way will be find to deliver airplane and munition of war to the army of generalissimo|chiang|kai shek remember that the chinese people be the first to stand up and fight against the aggressor in this war and in the future an a still unconquerable china will play proper role in maintain peace and prosperity not only in eastern|asia but in the whole world for every advance that the japanese have make since start frenzied career of conquest have have to pay a very heavy toll in warship in transport in plane and in man be feel the effect of those loss be even report from japan that somebody have drop bomb on tokyo and on other principal center of japanese war industry if this be true be the first time in history that japan have suffer such indignity although the treacherous attack on pearl|harbor be the immediate cause of entry into the war that event find the american people spiritually prepared for war on a world wide scale go into this war fighting know what be fight for realize that the war have become what hitler originally proclaim to be a total war not all of can have the privilege of fight enemy in distant part of the world not all of can have the privilege of work in a munition factory or a shipyard or on the farm or in oil field or mine produce the weapon or the raw material which that be need by armed force but there be front and battle where everyone in the|united|state every man woman and child be in action and will be privilege to remain in action throughout this war that front be right here at home in daily life and in daily task here at home everyone will have the privilege of make whatever self denial be necessary not only to supply fighting man but to keep the economic structure of country fortify and secure during the war and after the war this will require of course the abandonment not only of luxury but of many other creature comfort every loyal american be aware of individual responsibility whenever hear anyone say the american people be complacent need to be arouse feel like ask to come to washington and to read the mail that flood into the|white|house and into all department of this government the question that recur through all these thousand of letter and message be what more can do to help country in win this war to build the factory and to buy the material and to pay the labor and to provide the transportation and to equip and feed and house the soldier sailor and marine and to do all the thousand of thing necessary in a war all cost a lot of money more money than have ever be spend by any nation at any time in the long history of the world be now spend solely for war purpose the sum of every day in the|week but before this|year be over that almost unbelievable rate of expenditure will be double all of this money have to be spend and spend quickly if be to produce within the time now available the enormous quantity of weapon of war which need but the spending of these tremendous sum present grave danger of disaster to national economy when government continue to spend these unprecedented sum for munition month by month and year by year that money go into the pocketbook and bank account of the people of the|united|state at the same time raw material and many manufacture good be necessarily take away from civilian use and machinery and factory be be convert to war production do not have to be a professor of mathematic or economic to see that if people with plenty of cash start bid against each other for scarce good the price of those good go up yesterday submit to a point program a program of general principle which take together could be call the national economic policy for attain the great objective of keep the cost of live down repeat now to in substance first must through heavy taxis keep personal and corporate profit at a low reasonable rate second must fix ceiling on price and rent third must stabilize wage fourth must stabilize farm price fifth must put more billion into war|bond sixth must ration all essential commodity which be scarce seventh must discourage installment buying and encourage pay off debt and mortgage do not think be necessary to repeat what say yesterday to the congress in discuss these general principle the important thing to remember be that earn of these point be dependent on the other if the whole program be to work some people be already take the position that every of the point be correct except the point which step on own individual toe a few seem very willing to approve self denial on the part of neighbor the only effective course of action be a simultaneous attack on all of the factor which increase the cost of living in comprehensive all embrace program cover price and profit and wage and taxis and debt the blunt fact be that every single person in the|united|state be go to be affect by this program some of will be affect more directly by or of these restrictive measure but all of will be affect indirectly by all of be a business man or do own stock in a business corporation well profit be go to be cut down to a reasonably low level by taxation income will be subject to high taxis indeed in these|days when every available dollar should go to the war effort do not think that any american citizen should have a net income in excess of per year after payment of taxis be a retailer or a wholesaler or a manufacturer or a farmer or a landlord ceiling be be place on the price at which can sell good or rent property do work for wage will have to forego high wage for particular job for the duration of the war all of be use to spend money for thing that want thing however which be not absolutely essential will all have to forego that kind of spending because must put every dime and every dollar can possibly spare out of earning into war|bonds and stamps because the demand of the war effort require the rationing of good of which there be not enough to go around because the stopping of purchase of non - essential will release thousand of worker who be need in the war effort as tell the congress yesterday sacrifice be not exactly the proper word with which to describe this program of self denial when at the end of this great struggle shall have save free way of life shall have make no sacrifice the price for civilization must be pay in hard work and sorrow and blood the price be not too high if doubt ask those million who live today under the tyranny of hitlerism ask the worker of france and norway and the|netherland whip to labor by the lash whether the stabilization of wage be too great a sacrifice ask the farmer of poland and denmark of czechoslovakia and france loot of livestock starve while own crop be steal from land ask whether parity price be too great a sacrifice ask the businessman of europe whose enterprise have be steal from owner whether the limitation of profit and personal income be too great a sacrifice ask the woman and child whom hitler be starve whether the rationing of tire and gasoline and sugar be too great a sacrifice do not have to ask have already give agonize answer this great war effort must be carry through to victorious conclusion by the indomitable will and determination of the people as great whole must not be impede by the faint of heart must not be impede by those who put own selfish interest above the interest of the nation must not be impede by those who pervert honest criticism into falsification of fact must not be impede by self style expert either in economic or military problem who know neither true figure nor geography must not be impede by a few bogus patriot who use the sacred freedom of the press to echo the sentiment of the propagandist in tokyo and berlin and above all shall not be imperil by the handful of noisy traitor of america and betrayer of christianity would be dictator who in heart and soul have yield to hitlerism and would have this republic do likewise shall use all of the executive power that have to carry out the policy lay down if become necessary to ask for any additional legislation in order to attain objective of prevent a spiral in the cost of living shall do so know the american farmer the american workman and the american businessman know that will gladly embrace this economy and equality of sacrifice satisfy that be necessary for the most vital and compelling motive in all life win through to victory never in the memory of man have there be a war in which the courage the endurance and the loyalt(y)y of civilian play so vital a part many thousand of civilian all over the world have be and be be kill or maim by enemy action indeed be the fortitude of the common people of britain under fire which enable that island to stand and prevent hitler from win the war in the ruin of london and coventry and other city be today the proud monument to british heroism own american civilian population be now relatively safe from such disaster and to an ever increase extent soldier sailor and marine be fight with great bravery and great skill on far distant front to make sure that shall remain safe should like to tell or story about the man have in armed force there be for instance example dr. corydon|m.|wassell be a missionary well known for good work in china be a simple modest retire man nearly|sixty|years|old but enter the service of country and be commission a lieutenant commander in the navy dr. wassell be assign to duty in java care for wounded officer and man of the cruiser houston and marblehead which have be in heavy action in the java sea when the japanese advance across the island be decide to evacuate as many as possible of the wound to australia but about|twelve of the man be so badly wound that could not not be move dr. wassell remain with these man know that would be capture by the enemy but decide to make a last desperate attempt to get the man out of java ask each of if wish to take the chance and every one agree first have to get the man to the sea coast fifty|mile away to do this have to improvise stretcher for the hazardous journey the man be suffer severely but dr. wassell keep alive by skill and inspire by own courage and as the official report say dr. wassell be almost like a christ like shepherd devote to flock on the sea coast embark the man on a little dutch ship be bomb and be machine gun by wave of japanese plane dr. wassell take virtual command of the ship and by great skill avoid destruction hide in small little bay and little inlet a|few|days|later dr. wassell and little small flock of wounded man reach australia safely and today dr. wassell now wear the|navy|cross another story concern a ship a ship rather than an individual man may remember the tragic sinking of the submarine the u.s.s. squalu off the new|england coast in the|summer|of|1939 some of the crew be lose but other be save by the speed and the efficiency of the surface rescue crew the squalus be tediously raise from the bottom of the ocean sea be repair and put back into commission and eventually sail again under a new name the u.s.s. sailfish today be a potent and effective unit of submarine fleet in the|southwest|pacific the sailfish have in operation in the those western pacific water have sink a japanese destroyer have torpedo a japanese cruiser have make torpedo hit of on a japanese aircraft carrier of the enlisted man of navy who go down with the squalus in and be rescue be today serve on the same ship the u.s.s. sailfish in this war seem to that be hearten to know that the squalus once give up as lose rise from the depth to fight for country in time of peril more story which that hear only|this|morning this be a story of of army flying fortresses operate in the|western|pacific the pilot of this plane be a modest young man proud of crew for of the tough fight a bomber have yet experience the bomber depart from base as part or a flight of bomber to attack japanese transport which that be land troop against in the philippines when have go about halfway to destination of the motor of this bomber go out of commission the young pilot lose contact with the other bomber the crew however get the motor working get go again and the plane proceed on mission alone by the time arrive at target the other flying|fortresse have already pass over have drop bomb and have stir up the hornet ' nest of japanese zero plane of these zero fighter attack flying|fortress despite this mass attack plane proceed on mission and drop all of bomb on japanese transport which be line up along the dock as turn back on

americans washington 's birthday be a most appropriate occasion for to talk with each other about thing as be today and thing as know shall be in the future for eight|year general|washington and continental|army be face continually with formidable odd and recur defeat supply and equipment be lack in a sense every winter be a valley forge throughout the state there exist fifth columnist and selfish man jealous man fearful man who proclaim that washington 's cause be hopeless and that should ask for a negotiate peace washington 's conduct in those hard time have provide the model for all americans ever since a model of moral stamina hold to course as have be chart in the|declaration|of|independence and the brave man who serve with know that no man 's life or fortune be secure without freedom and free institution the present great struggle have teach increasingly that freedom of person and security of property anywhere in the world depend upon the security of the right and obligation of liberty and justice everywhere in the world this war be a new kind of war be different from all other war of the past not only in method and weapon but also in geography be warfare in term of every continent every island every sea every air lane in the world that be the reason why have ask to take out and spread before the a map of the whole earth and to follow with in the reference which shall make to the world encircle battle line of this war many question will fear remain unanswered tonight but know will realize that can not cover everything in any short report to the people the broad ocean which have be herald in the past as protection from attack have become endless battlefield on which be constantly be challenge by enemy must all understand and face the hard fact that job now be to fight at distance which extend all the way around the globe fight at these vast distance because that be where enemy be until flow of supply give clear superiority must keep on strike enemy wherever and whenever can meet even if for a while have to yield ground actually though be take a heavy toll of the enemy every day that go by must fight at these vast distance to protect supply line and line of communication with ally protect these line from the enemy who be bend every ounce of strength strive against time to cut the object of the nazis and the japanese be to of course separate the|united|state britain china and russia and to isolate from another so that each will be surround and cut off from source of supply and reinforcement be the old familiar axis policy of divide and conquer there be those who still think however in term of the|days of sailing ship advise to pull warship and plane and merchant ship into own home water and concentrate solely on last ditch defense but let illustrate what would happen if follow such foolish advice look at map look at the vast area of china with million of fight man look at the vast area of russia with powerful army and prove military might look at the british|isles)|island of britain australia new|zealand the|dutch|indy india and with re)source of raw material resource of raw material and of people determine to resist axis domination look too at north|america central|america and be obvious what would happen if all of these great reservoir of power be cut off from each other either by enemy action or by self impose isolation first in such a case could no longer send aid of any kind to china to the brave people who for nearly|five|years have withstand japanese assault destroy hundreds|of|thousand of japanese soldier and vast quantity of japanese war munition be essential that help china in magnificent defense and in inevitable counteroffensive for that be important element in the ultimate defeat of japan secondly if lose communication with the southwest pacific all of that area include australia and new|zealand and the|dutch|indy would fall under japanese domination japan in such a case could then release great number of ship and man to launch attack on a large scale against the coast of and central|america and north|america include alaska at the same time could immediately extend conquest to in the other direction toward india and through the|indian|ocean to africa and to and try to join force with germany and italy third if be to stop send munition to the british and the russians in the mediterranean area and in the|persian|gulf and the|red|sea area would be help the nazis to overrun turkey and syria and iraq and persia that be now call iran – egypt and the|suez|canal the whole coast of north|africa and with that inevitably the whole coast of west|africa put germany within easy striking distance of away fourth if by such a fatuous policy cease to protect the north|atlantic supply line to britain and to russia would help to cripple the splendid counter - offensive by russia against the nazis and would help to deprive britain of essential food supply and munition those americans who believe that could live under the illusion of isolationism want the american eagle to imitate the tactic of the ostrich now many of those same people afraid that may be stick neck out want national bird to be turn into a turtle but prefer to retain the eagle as be fly high and strike hard know that speak for the mass of the american people when say that reject the turtle policy and will continue increasingly the policy of carry the war to the enemy in distant land and distant water as far away as possible from own home ground there be main line of communication now be travel by ship the|north|atlantic the|south|atlantic the|indian|ocean and these route be not way street for the ship which that carry troop and munition out bind bring back essential raw material which require for own use the maintenance of these vital line be a very tough job be a job which require tremendous daring tremendous resourcefulness and above all tremendous production of plane and tank and gun and also of the ship to carry and speak again for the american people when say that can and will do that job the defense of the world wide line of communication demand compel relatively safe use by of the sea and of the air along the various route and this in turn depend upon control by the|united|nation of the many strategic basis along those route control of the air involve the simultaneous use of type of plane first the long range heavy bomber and second the light bomber the dive bomber the torpedo plane and the short range pursuit plane all of which be essential to the cooperate with and protect(ion of the basis and of the bomber heavy bomber can fly under own power from here to the southwest pacific either way but the small plane can not therefore these light plane have to be pack in crate and send on board cargo ship look at map again and will see that the route be long and at many place perilous either across the|south|atlantic all the way a)round south|africa and or from california to the east indies direct a vessel can make a round trip by either route in about|four|months or only|three round trip in a|whole|year in spite of the length and in spite of the difficulty of this transportation can tell that in two|and|a|half|months already have a large number of bomber and pursuit plane man by american pilot and crew which be now in daily contact with the enemy in the|southwest|pacific and thousand of american troop be today in that area engage in operation not only in the air but on the ground as well in this battle area japan have have an obvious initial advantage for could fly even short range plane to the point of attack by use many stepping stone open to basis in a multitude of pacific island and also basis on the china coast indo china coast and in thailand and malaya coast japanese troop transport could go south from japan and from china through the narrow china|sea which can be protect by japanese plane throughout whole length ask to look at map again particularly at that portion of the pacific|ocean lie west of hawaii before this war even start the|philippine|island be already surround on side by japanese power on the west the china side the japanese be in possession of the coast of china and the coast of indo china which have be yield to by on the north be the island of japan reach down almost to northern luzon on the east be the|mandated|island which japan have occupy exclusively and have fortify in absolute violation of write word the island that lie between hawaii and the philippines these island hundred of appear only as small dot on most map but do not appear at all but cover a large strategic area guam lie in the middle of a lone outpost which have never fortify under the|washington|treaty of have solemnly agree not to add to the fortification of the philippines islands have no safe naval basis there so could not use the island for extensive naval operation immediately after this war start the japanese force move down on either side of the philippines to numerous point south of thereby completely encircle the islands philippine from north and south and east and west be that complete encirclement with control of the air by japanese land base aircraft which have prevent from send substantial reinforcement of man and material to the gallant defender of the philippines for forty|year have always be strategy a strategy bear of necessity that in the event of a full scale attack on the islands by japan should fight a delay action attempt to retire slowly into bataan|peninsula and corregidor know that the war as a whole would have to be fight and win by a process of attrition against japan know all along that with great resource could ultimately out build japan and ultimately overwhelm on sea and on land and in the air know that to obtain objective many variety of operation would be necessary in area other than the philippines now nothing that have occur in the|past|two|month have cause to revise this basic strategy of necessity except that the defense put up by general macarthur have magnificently exceed the previous estimate of endurance and and man be gain eternal glory therefore macarthur 's army of filipinos and americans and the force of the|united|nation in china in burma and the|netherlands|east|indies be all together fulfil the same essential task be make japan pay an increasingly terrible price for ambitious attempt to seize control of the whole atlantic asiatic world every japanese transport sink off java be less transport that can use to carry reinforcement to army oppose general macarthur in luzon have be say that japanese gain in the philippines be make possible only by the success of surprise attack on pearl|harbor tell that this be not so even if the attack have not be make map will show that would have be a hopeless operation for to send the fleet to the philippines through thousands|of|mile of ocean while all those island basis be under the sole control of the japanese the consequence of the attack on pearl|harbor serious as be have be wildly exaggerate in other way and these exaggeration come originally from axis propagandist but have be repeat regret to say by americans in and out of public life and have the utmost contempt for americans who since pearl|harbor have whisper or announce off the record that there be no longer any pacific|fleet that the fleet be all sink or destroy on december|7th that more|than|a|thousand of plane be destroy on the ground have suggest slyly that the government have withhold the truth about casualty that or man be kill at pearl|harbor instead of the figure as officially announce have even serve the enemy propagandist by spread the incredible story that shipload of body of honored american dead be about to arrive in new|york harbor to be put into a common grave almost every axis broadcast –|berlin rome tokyo directly quote americans who by speech or in the press make damnable misstatement such as these the american people realize that in many case detail of military operation can not be disclose until be absolutely certain that the announcement will not give to the enemy military information which do not already possess government have unmistakable confidence in ability to hear the bad without flinch or lose heart must in turn have complete confidence that government be keep nothing from except information that will help the enemy in attempt to destroy in a democracy there be always a solemn pact of truth between government and the people but there must also always be a full use of discretion and that word discretion apply to the critic of government as well this be war the american people want to know and will be tell the general trend of how the war be go but do not wish to help the enemy any more than fighting force do and will pay little attention to the rumor monger and the poison peddler in midst to pass from the realm of rumor and poison to the field of fact the number of officer and man kill in the attack on pearl|harbor on december|7th be and the number wound be of all of the combatant ship base on pearl|harbor – battleship heavy cruiser light cruiser aircraft carrier destroyer and submarine only|three be be permanently put out of commission very many of the ship of the|pacific|fleet be not even in pearl|harbor some of those that be there be hit very slightly and other that be damage have either rejoin the fleet by now or be still undergo repair and when those repair be complete the ship will be more efficient fighting machine than be before the report that lose more|than|a|thousand air)plane at pearl|harbor be as baseless as the other weird rumor the japanese do not know just how many plane destroy that|day and be not go to tell but can say that to date and include pearl|harbor have destroy considerably more japanese plane than have destroy of have most certainly suffer loss from hitler 's u boats in the atlantic as well as from the japanese in the pacific and shall suffer more of before the turn of the tide but speak for the|united|states|of|america let say once and for all to the people of the world americans have be compel to yield ground but will regain and the other united|nation be commit to the destruction of the militarism of japan and germany be daily increase strength soon and not enemy will have the offensive not will win the final battle and not will make the final peace conquer nation in europe know what the yoke of the nazis be like and the people of korea and of manchuria know in flesh the harsh despotism of japan all of the people of asia know that if there be to be an honorable and decent future for any of or any of for that future depend on victory by the|united|nation over the force of axis enslavement if a just and durable peace be to be attain or even if all of be merely to save own skin there be thought for here at home to keep uppermost the fulfillment of special task of production uninterrupted production stress that word uninterrupted germany italy and japan be very close to maximum output of plane gun tank and ship the|united|nation be not especially the|united|states|of|america first job then be to build up production uninterrupted production so that the|united|nation can maintain control of the sea and attain control of the air not merely a slight superiority but an overwhelming superiority on january|6th|of|this|year set certain definite goal of production for airplane tank gun and ship the axis propagandist call fantastic tonight nearly|two|months|later and after a careful survey of progress by donald|nelson and other charge with responsibility for production can tell that those goal will be attain in every part of the country expert in production and the man and woman at work in the plant be give loyal service with few exception labor capital and farming realize that this be no time either to make undue profit or to gain special advantage over the other be call for new plant and addition addition to old plant be call for plant conversion to war need be seek more man and more woman to run be work long hour be come to realize that extra plane or extra tank or extra gun or extra ship complete tomorrow may in a|few|month turn the tide on some distant battlefield may make the difference between life and death for some of own fighting man know now that if lose this war will be generation or even century before conception of democracy can live again and can lose this war only if use slow up effort or if waste ammunition sniping at each other here be high purpose for every american shall not stop work for a|single|day if any dispute arise shall keep on work while the dispute be solve by mediation or conciliation or arbitration until the war be win shall not demand special gain or special privilege or special advantage for any group or occupation shall give up convenience and modify the routine of life if country ask to do so will do cheerfully remember that the common enemy seek to destroy every home and every freedom in every part of land this generation of americans have come to realize with a present and personal realization that there be something large and more important than the life of any individual or of any individual group something for which a man will sacrifice and gladly sacrifice not only pleasure not only good not only association with those love but life in time of crisis when the future be in the balance come to understand with full recognition and devotion what this nation be and what owe to the axis propagandist have try in various evil way to destroy determination and morale fail in that be now try to destroy confidence in own ally say that the british be finish that the russians and the chinese be about to quit patriotic and sensible americans will reject these absurdity and instead of listen to any of this crude propaganda will recall some of the thing that nazis and japanese have say and be still say about ever since this nation become the arsenal of democracy ever since enactment of lend lease there have be persistent theme through all axis propaganda this theme have be that americans be admittedly rich and that americans have considerable industrial power but that americans be soft and decadent that can not and will not unite and work and fight from berlin rome and tokyo have be describe as a nation of weakling playboy who would hire british soldier or russian soldier or chinese soldier to do fighting for let repeat that now let tell that to general macarthur and man let tell that to the sailor who today be hit hard in the far water of the pacific let tell that to the boy in the flying fortresses let tell that to the marines

such a prodigious effort never before have have so little time in which to do so much these be the time that try man 's soul tom|paine write those word on a drumhead by the light of a campfire that be when washington 's little army of ragged rugged man be retreat across new|jersey have taste nothing naught but defeat and general|washington order that these great word write by be read to the man of every regiment in the|continental|army and this be the assurance give to the first american armed force the summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service of

envoy in midst the course that japan have follow for the|past|ten|year in asia have parallel the course of hitler and mussolini in europe and in africa today have become far more than a parallel be actual collaboration so well calculate that all the continent of the world and all the ocean be now consider by the axis strategist as gigantic battlefield in ten|years|ago japan invade manchukuo — without warning in italy invade ethiopia — without warning in hitler occupy austria without warning in hitler invade czechoslovakia — without warning later in hitler invade poland — without warning in hitler invade norway denmark the|netherlands belgium and luxembourg — without warning in italy attack france and later greece — without warning and this|year in the axis|power attack yugoslavia and greece and dominate the balkans without warning in also hitler invade russia without warning and now japan have attack malaya and thailand — and the|united|state without warning be all of pattern be now in this war be all in all the way every single man woman and child be a partner in the most tremendous undertaking of american history must share together the bad news and the good news the defeat and the victory the change fortune of war so far the news have be all bad have suffer a serious setback in hawaii force in the philippines which include the brave people of that commonwealth be take punishment but be defend vigorously the report from guam and wake and midway|islands be still confused but must be prepare for the announcement that all these outpost have be seize the casualty list of these|first|few|days will undoubtedly be large deeply feel the anxiety of all of the family of the man in armed force and the relative of people in city which have be bomb can only give solemn promise that will get news just as quickly as possible this government will put trust in the stamina of the american people and will give the fact to the public just as soon as condition have be fulfil first that the information have be definitely and officially confirm and second that the release of the information at the time be receive will not prove valuable to the enemy directly or indirectly most earnestly urge countryman to reject all rumor these ugly little hint of complete disaster fly thick and fast in wartime have to be examine and appraise as an example can tell frankly that until further survey be make have not sufficient information to state the exact damage which have be do to naval vessel at pearl|harbor admittedly the damage be serious but no one can say how serious until know how much of this damage can be repair and how quickly the necessary repair can be make cite as another example a statement make on that a japanese carrier have be locate and sink off the|canal|zone and when hear statement that be attribute to what call an authoritative source can be reasonably sure from now on that under these war circumstance the authoritative source be not any person in authority many rumor and report which now hear originate of course with enemy source for instance today the japanese be claim that as a result of action against hawaii hare gain naval supremacy in the pacific this be an old trick of propaganda which have be use innumerable time by the nazis the purpose of such fantastic claim be of course to spread fear and confusion among and to goad into reveal military information which enemy be desperately anxious to obtain government will not be catch in this obvious trap and neither will the people of the|united|state must be remember by each and every of that free and rapid communication these|day must be greatly restrict in wartime be not possible to receive full and speedy and accurate report front distant area of combat this be particularly true where naval operation be concern for in these|day of the marvel of the radio be often impossible for the commanders of various unit to report activity by radio at all for the very simple reason that this information would become available to the enemy and would disclose position and plan of defense or attack of necessity there will be delay in officially confirm or deny report of operation but will not hide fact from the country if know the fact and if the enemy will not be aid by disclosure to all newspaper and radio station all those who reach the eye and ear of the american people say this have a most grave responsibility to the nation now and for the duration of this war if feel that government be not disclose enough of the truth have every right to say so but in the absence of all the fact as reveal by official source have no right in the ethic of patriotism to deal out unconfirmed report in such a way as to make people believe that be gospel truth every citizen in every walk of life share this same responsibility the life of soldier and sailor the whole future of this nation depend upon the manner in which each and every of fulfill obligation to country now a word about the recent past and the future a|year|and|a|half have elapse since the fall of france when the whole world first realize the mechanized may which the axis nation have be build up for so|many|year america have use that|year|and|a|half to great advantage know that the attack may reach in all too short a time immediately begin greatly to increase industrial strength and capacity to meet the demand of modern warfare precious|month be gain by send vast quantity of war material to the nation of the world still able to resist axis aggression policy rest on the fundamental truth that the defense of any country resist hitler or japan be in the long run the defense of own country that policy have be justify have give time invaluable time to build american assembly line of production assembly line be now in operation other be be rush to completion a steady stream of tank and plane of gun and ship and shell and equipment that be what these|eighteen|month have give but be all only a beginning of what still have to be do must be set to face a long war against crafty and powerful bandit the attack at pearl|harbor can be repeat at any of many point point in both ocean and along both coast line and against all the rest of the hemisphere will not only be a long war will be a hard war that be the basis on which now lie all plan that be the yardstick by which measure what shall need and demand money material double and quadruple production — ever increase the production must be not only for own army and navy and air force must reinforce the other army and navy and air force fight the nazis and the war lord of japan throughout the americas and throughout the world have be work today on the subject of production government have decide on broad policy the first be to speed up all exist production by work on a basis in every war industry include the production of essential raw material the second policy now be put into form be to rush addition to the capacity of production by build more new plant by add to old plant and by use the many small plant for war need over the hard road of the|past|months have at time meet obstacle and difficulty division and dispute indifference and callousness that be now all past and be sure forget the fact be that the country now have an organization in washington build around man and woman who be recognize expert in own field think the country know that the people who be actually responsible in each and every of these many field be pull together with a teamwork that have never before be excel on the road ahead there lie hard work gruele work day and night every|hour and every minute be about to add that ahead there lie sacrifice for all of but be not correct to use that word the|united|state do not consider a sacrifice to do all one can to give one 's good to nation when the nation be fight for existence and future life be not a sacrifice for any man old or young to be in the army or the navy of the|united|state rather be a privilege be not a sacrifice for the industrialist or the wage earner the farmer or the shopkeeper the trainman or the doctor to pay more taxis to buy more bond to forego extra profit to work longer or harder at the task for which be best fit rather be a privilege be not a sacrifice to do without many thing to which be accustomed if the national defense call for do without a review this|morning lead to the conclusion that at present shall not have to curtail the normal use of article of food there be enough food today for all of and enough leave over to send to those who be fight on the same side with but there will be a clear and definite shortage of metal for many kind of civilian use for the very good reason that in increase program shall need for war purpose more|than|half of that portion of the principal metal which during the|past|year have go into article for civilian use yes shall have to give up many thing entirely and be sure that the people in every part of the nation be prepare in individual live to win this war be sure that will cheerfully help to pay a large part of financial cost while go on be sure will cheerfully give up those material thing that be ask to give up and be sure that will retain all those great spiritual thing without which can not win through repeat that the|united|states can accept no result save victory final and complete not only must the shame of japanese treachery be wipe out but the source of international brutality wherever exist must be absolutely and finally break in message to the congress yesterday say that will make very certain that this form of treachery shall never endanger again in order to achieve that certainty must begin the great task that be before by abandon once and for all the illusion that can ever again isolate from the rest of humanity in these|past|few|year and most violently in — have learn a terrible lesson be obligation to dead be sacred obligation to child and to child that must never forget what have learn and what have learn be this there be no such thing as security for any nation or any individual in a world rule by the principle of gangsterism there be no such thing as impregnable defense against powerful aggressor who sneak up in the dark and strike without warning have learn that ocean girt hemisphere be not immune from severe attack that can not measure safety in term of mile on any map any more may acknowledge that enemy have perform a brilliant feat of deception perfectly time and execute with great skill be a thoroughly dishonorable deed but must face the fact that modern warfare as conduct in the nazi manner be a dirty business do not like — do not want to get in but be in and be go to fight with everything have get do not think any american have any doubt of ability to administer proper punishment to the perpetrator of these crime government know that for week germany have be tell japan that if japan do not attack the|united|state japan would not share in divide the spoil with germany when peace come be promise by germany that if come in would receive the complete and perpetual control of the whole of the pacific area and that mean not only but also all of the islands in the pacific and also a stranglehold on the west coast of north central and south america know also that germany and japan be conduct military and naval operation in accordance with a joint plan that plan consider all people and nation which be not help the axis power as common enemy of each and every of the axis power that be simple and obvious grand strategy and that be why the american people must realize that can be match only with similar grand strategy must realize for example that japanese success against the|united|state in the pacific be helpful to german operation in libya that any german success against the caucasus be inevitably an assistance to japan in operation against the|dutch|east|indies that a german attack against algiers or morocco open the way to a german attack against south|america and the canal on the other side of the picture must learn also to know that guerilla warfare against the germans in let say serbia or norway help that a successful russian offensive against the germans help and that british success on land or sea in any part of the world strengthen hand remember always that germany and italy regardless of any formal declaration of war consider at war with the|united|state at this moment just as much as consider at war with britain or russia and germany put all the other republics|of|the americas into the same category of enemy the people of sister republics of this hemisphere can be honor by that fact the true goal seek be far above and beyond the ugly field of battle when resort to force as now must be determined that this force shall be direct toward ultimate good as well as against immediate evil americans be not destroyer be builder be now in the midst of a war not for conquest not for vengeance but for a world in which this nation and all that this nation represent will be safe for child expect to eliminate the danger from japan but would serve ill if accomplish that and find that the rest of the world be dominate by hitler and mussolini so be go to win the war and be go to win the peace that follow and in of this day through dark day that may be yet to come — will know that the vast majority of the member of the human race be on side many of be fight with all of be pray for but in represent cause represent as well hope and hope for liberty under god & nbsp view transcript transcript mr. vice president and mr. speaker and member of the senate and house|of|representatif

deliberately plan many|day or even weeks|ago during the intervene time have deliberately seek to deceive the|united|state by false statement and expression of hope for continued peace the attack yesterday on the|hawaiian|island have cause severe damage to american naval and military force regret to tell that very many american life have be lose in addition american ship have be report torpedo on the high sea between san|francisco and honolulu yesterday the|japanese|government also launch an attack against malaya last night japanese force attack hong|kong last|night japanese force attack guam last|night japanese force attack the|philippine|island last|night the japanese attack wake|island and this|morn the japanese attack japan have therefore undertake a surprise offensive extend throughout the pacific area the fact of yesterday and today speak for the people of the|united|state have already form opinion and well understand the implication to the very life and safety of nation as commander in chief of the army and navy have direct that all measure be take for defense but always will whole nation remember the character of the onslaught against no matter how long may take to overcome this premeditated invasion the american people in righteous may will win through to absolute victory believe that interpret the will of the congress and of the people when assert that will not only defend to the uttermost but will make very certain that this form of treachery shall never again endanger hostility exist there be no blink at the fact that people territory and interest be in grave danger with confidence in armed force with the unbounding determination of people will gain the inevitable triumph so help god ask that the congress declare that since the unprovoked and dastardly attack by japan on sunday,|december|7,|1941 a state of war have exist between the|united|state and view transcript transcript fellow americans of the|united|state have report to that on the|morning of september fourth the united|states destroyer greer proceed in full daylight towards iceland have reach a point southeast of greenland be carry american mail to iceland be fly the american flag identity as an american ship be unmistakable be then and there attack by a submarine germany admit that be a german submarine the submarine deliberately fire a torpedo at the greer follow later by another torpedo attack in spite of what hitler 's propaganda bureau have invent and in spite of what any american obstructionist organization may prefer to believe tell the blunt fact that the german submarine fire first upon this american destroyer without warning and with deliberate design to sink destroyer at the time be in water which the|government|of|the|united|state have declare to be water of self defense surround outpost of american protection in the atlantic in the|north|of|the|atlantic outpost have be establish by in iceland in greenland in labrador and in newfoundland through these water there pass many ship of many flag bear food and other supply to civilian and bear material of war for which the people of the|united|state be spend billions|of|dollar and which by congressional action have declare to be essential for the defense of own land the united|state destroyer when attack be proceed on a legitimate mission if the destroyer be visible to the submarine when the torpedo be fire then the attack be a deliberate attempt by the nazis to sink a clearly identify american warship on the other hand if the submarine be beneath the surface of the sea and with the aid of listening device fire in the direction of the sound of the american destroyer without even take the trouble to learn identity as the official german communique would indicate then the attack be even more outrageous for indicate a policy of indiscriminate violence against any vessel sail the sea or non - belligerent this be piracy piracy legally and morally be not the first nor the last act of piracy which the|nazi|government have commit against the american flag in this war for attack have follow attack a|few|months|ago an american flag merchant ship the robin moor be sink by a nazi submarine in the middle of the|south|atlantic under circumstance violate long establish international law and violate every principle of humanity the passenger and the crew be force into open boat hundreds|of|mile from land in direct violation of international agreement sign by nearly all nation include the|government|of|germany no apology no allegation of mistake no offer of reparation have come from the|nazi|government in july,|1941 nearly|two|months|ago an american battleship in north|american water be follow by a submarine which for a long time seek to maneuver into a position of attack upon the battleship the periscope of the submarine be clearly see no british or american submarine be within hundreds|of|mile of this spot at the time so the nationality of the submarine be clear five|days|ago a united|states|navy ship on patrol pick up survivor of an american own ship operate under the flag of sister republic of panama the|s.|s.|sessa on august|seventeenth have be first torpedo without warning and then shell near greenland while carry civilian supply to iceland be fear that the other member of crew have be drown in view of the establish presence of german submarine in this vicinity there can be no reasonable doubt as to the identity of the flag of the attacker five|days|ago another|united|stat merchant ship the steel seafarer be sink by a german aircraft in the|red|sea and twenty|miles south of suez be bind for an egyptian port so of the vessel sink or attack fly the american flag and be clearly identifiable of these ship be warship of the|american|navy in the fifth case the vessel sink clearly carry the flag of sister republic of panama in the face of all this americans be keep foot on the ground type of democratic civilization have outgrow the thought of feeling compel to fight some other nation by reason of any single piratical attack on of ship be not become hysterical or lose sense of proportion therefore what be think and say tonight do not relate to any isolated episode instead americans be take a long range point of view in regard to certain fundamental and a point of view in regard to a series of event on land and on sea which must be consider as a whole as a part of a world pattern would be unworthy of a great nation to exaggerate an isolated incident or to become inflame by some|one act of violence but would be inexcusable folly to minimize such incident in the face of evidence which make clear that the incident be not isolate but be part of a general plan the important truth be that these act of international lawlessness be a manifestation of a design which a design that have be make clear to the american people for a long time be the nazi design to abolish the freedom of the sea and to acquire absolute control and domination of the these sea for for with control of the sea in own hand the way can obviously become clear for next step domination of the|united|state and the domination of the|western|hemisphere by force of arm under nazi control of the sea no merchant ship of the|united|state or of any other american|republic would be free to carry on any peaceful commerce except by the condescending grace of this foreign and tyrannical power the|atlantic|ocean which have be and which should always be a free and friendly highway for would then become a deadly menace to the commerce of the|united|state to the coast of the|united|state and even to the inland city of the|united|state the|hitler|government in defiance of the law of the sea and in defiance of the recognize right of all other nation have presume to declare on paper that great area of the sea even include a vast expanse lie in the|western|hemisphere be to be close and that no ship may enter for any purpose except at peril of be sink actually be sink ship at will and without warn in widely separate area both within and far outside of these far flung pretend zone this nazi attempt to seize control of the ocean be but a counterpart of the nazi plot now be carry on throughout the|western|hemisphere all design toward the same end for hitler 's advance guard not only avowed agent but also dupe among have seek to make ready for foothold and bridgehead in the|new|world to be use as soon as have gain control of the ocean intrigue plot machination sabotage in this new world be all know to conspiracy have follow conspiracy for example last|year a plot to seize the government of uruguay be smash by the prompt action of that country which be support in full by american neighbor a like plot be then hatch in argentina and that government have carefully and wisely block at every point more recently an endeavor be make to subvert the government of bolivia and within the|past|few|week the discovery be make of secret air land field in colombia within easy range of could multiply instance(s upon instance to be ultimately successful in world mastery hitler know that must get control of the sea must first destroy the bridge of ship which be build across the atlantic and over which shall continue to roll the implement of war to help destroy and)to destroy all work in the end must wipe out patrol on sea and in the air if be to do must silence the|british|navy think must be explain again and over and over again to people who like to think of as an invincible protection that this can be true only if the british navy survive and that friend be simple arithmetic for if the world outside of the americas fall under axis domination the shipbuilding facility which the axis power would then possess in all of europe in the|british|isle and in the|far|east would be much great than all the shipbuilding facility and potentiality of all of the americas not only great but time great enough to win even if the|united|state throw all resource into such a situation seek to double and even redouble the size of navy the axis power in control of the rest of the world would have the manpower and the physical resource to outbuild several time over be time for all americans americans of all the americas to stop be delude by the romantic notion that the americas can go on live happily and peacefully in a nazi dominate world generation after generation america have battle for the general policy of the freedom of the sea and that policy be a very simple but a basic a fundamental one mean that no nation have the right to make the broad ocean of the world at great distance from the actual theatre of land war unsafe for the commerce of other that have be policy prove time and time again in all of history policy have apply from time immemorial of the republic and still apply not merely to the atlantic but to the pacific and to all other ocean as well unrestricted submarine warfare in constitute defiance an act of aggression against that historic american policy be now clear that hitler have begin campaign to control the sea by ruthless force and by wipe out every vestige of international law and every vestige of humanity intention have be make clear the american people can have no further illusion about no tender whispering of appeaser that hitler be not interested in the|western|hemisphere no soporific lullaby that a wide ocean protect from can long have any effect on the hard head far sighted and realistic american people because of these episode because of the movement and operation of german warship and because of the clear repeat proof that the present government of germany have no respect for treaty or for international law that have no decent attitude toward neutral nation or human life americans be now face to face not with abstract theory but with cruel relentless fact this attack on the greer be no localize military operation in the|north|atlantic this be no mere episode in a struggle between nation this be determined step towards create a permanent world system base on force on terror and on murder and be sure that even now the nazis be wait wait to see whether the|united|state will by silence give the green light to go ahead on this path of destruction the nazi danger to western world have long cease to be a mere possibility the danger be here now not only from a military enemy but from an enemy of all law all liberty all morality all religion there have now come a time when and must see the cold inexorable necessity of say to these inhuman unrestrained seeker of world conquest and permanent world domination by the sword seek to throw child and child 's child into form of terrorism and slavery have now attack own safety shall go no further normal practice of diplomacy note writing be of no possible use in deal with international outlaw who sink ship and kill citizen peaceful nation after another have meet disaster because each refuse to look the nazi danger squarely in the eye until have actually have by the throat the|united|state will not make that fatal mistake no act of violence or no act of intimidation will keep from maintain intact bulwark of american defense first line of supply of material to the enemy of hitler and the freedom of shipping on the high sea no matter what take no matter what cost will keep open the line of legitimate commerce in these defensive water of have seek no shoot war with hitler do not seek now but neither do want peace so much that be willing to pay for by permit to attack naval and merchant ship while be on legitimate business assume that the german leader be not deeply concerned tonight or any other time by what americans or the|american|government say or publish about can not bring about the downfall of nazi ism by the use of long range invective but when see a rattlesnake poise to strike do not wait until have strike before crush these nazi submarine and raider be the rattlesnake of the atlantic be a menace to the free pathway of the high sea be a challenge to own sovereignty hammer at most precious right when attack ship of the american flag symbol of independence freedom very life be clear to all americans that the time have come when the americas must now be defend a continuation of attack in own water or in water which that could be use for further and great attack on will inevitably weaken american ability to repel hitlerism do not let split hair be hair splitter let not ask whether the americas should begin to defend after the fifth first attack or the tenth fifth attack or the tenth attack or the twentieth attack the time for active defense be now do not let split hair let not say will only defend if the torpedo succeed in get home or if the crew and the passenger be drown this be the time for prevention of attack if submarine or raider attack in distant water can attack equally well within sight of own shore very presence in any water which america deem vital to defense constitute an attack in the water which deem necessary for defense american naval vessel and american plane will no longer wait until axis submarine lurk under the water or axis raider on the surface of the sea strike deadly blow first upon naval and air patrol now operate in large number over a vast expanse of the|atlantic|ocean fall the duty of maintain the american policy of freedom of the sea now that mean very simply and very clearly that patrolling vessel and plane will protect all merchant ship not only american ship but ship of any flag engage in commerce in defensive water will protect from submarine will protect from surface raider this situation be not new the second president of the|united|state john|adams order to clean out european privateer and european ship of war which be infest the caribbean and south|american water destroy american commerce the third president of the|united|state thomas|jefferson order to end the attack be make upon american and other ship by the corsair of the nation of north|africa obligation as president be historic be clear yes be inescapable be no act of war on part when decide to protect the sea which that be vital to american defense the aggression be not ours be solely defense but let this warning be clear from now on if german or italian vessel of war enter the water the protection of which be necessary for american defense do so at own peril the order which have give as commander in chief to of the|united|states|army and navy be to carry out that policy at once the sole responsibility rest upon germany there will be no shooting unless germany continue to seek that be obvious duty in this crisis that be the clear right of this sovereign nation that this be the only step possible if would keep tight the wall of defense which be pledge to maintain around have no illusion about the gravity of this step have not take hurriedly or lightly be the result of month and month of constant thought and anxiety and prayer in the protection of nation and mine can not be avoid the american people have face other grave crisis in history with american courage and with american resolution will do no less today know the actuality of the attack upon know the necessity of a bold defense against these attack know that the time call for clear head and fearless heart and with that inner strength that come to a free people conscious of duty and conscious of the righteousness of what do will with divine help and guidance stand ground against this late assault upon democracy sovereignty and freedom view transcript transcript be speak tonight from the|white|house in the presence of the|governing|board|of|the|pan|american|union the canadian minister and family the member of this board be the ambassadors and ministers of the|american|republics in washington be appropriate that do this for now as never before the unity of the|american republics be of supreme importance to each and every of and to the cause of freedom throughout the world future independence be bind up with the future independence of all of sister republics the press problem that confront be military and naval problem can not afford to approach from the point of view of wishful thinker or sentimentalist what face be cold hard fact the first and fundamental fact be that what start as a european war have develop as the nazis always intend should develop into a world war for world domination adolf|hitler never consider the domination of europe as an end in european conquest be but a step toward ultimate goal in all the other continent be unmistakably apparent to all of that unless the advance of hitlerism be forcibly check now the|western|hemisphere will be within range of the nazi weapon of destruction for own defense have accordingly undertake certain obviously necessary measure first have join in conclude a series of agreement with all the other american republics this further solidify hemisphere against the common danger and then a|year|ago launch and be successfully carry out the large armament production program have ever undertake have add substantially to splendid navy and have muster manpower to build up a new army which be already worthy of the high tradition of military service institute a policy of aid for the democracy the nations which have fight for the continuation of human liberty this policy have origin in the|first|month of the war when urge upon the congress repeal of the arm embargo provision in the old neutrality law and in that message of september|3,|1939 say should like to be able to offer the hope that the shadow over the world may swiftly pass can not the fact compel stating with candor that dark period may lie ahead in the|subsequent|months the shadow deepen and lengthen and the night spread over poland denmark norway holland belgium luxembourg and france in june,|1940 britain stand alone face by the same machine of terror which have overwhelm ally government rush arm to meet desperate need in september,|1940 an agreement be complete with great|britain for the trade of destroyer for important offshore basis and in march,|1941 the congress pass the lend lease bill and an appropriation of seven|billion|dollars to implement this law realistically provide for material aid for the government of any country whose defense the president deem vital to the defense of the|united|state whole program of aid for the democracy have be base on hard head concern for own security and for the kind of safe and civilized world in which wish to live every dollar of material that send help to keep the dictator away from own hemisphere and every|day that be hold off give time to build more gun and tank and plane and ship have make no pretense about own self interest in this aid great|britain understand and so do nazi|germany and now after a|year britain still fight gallantly on a far flung battle line have double and redouble vast production increase month by month material supply of the tool of war for and for britain and for china- and eventually for all the democracy the supply of these tool will not fail will increase with greatly augmented strength the|united|state and the other american republics now chart course in the situation of today government know what term hitler if victorious would impose be indeed the only term on which would accept a so call negotiate peace and under those term germany would literally parcel out the world hoist the swastika over vast territory and population and set up puppet government of own choosing wholly subject to the will and the policy of a conqueror to the people of the americas a triumphant hitler would say as say after the seizure of austria and as say after munich and as say after the seizure of czechoslovakia be now completely satisfied this be the last territorial readjustment will seek and would of course add all want be peace friendship and profitable trade relation with in the new world be any of in the americas so incredibly simple and forgetful as to accept those honeyed word what would then happen those in the new world who be seek profit would be urge that all that the dictatorship desire be peace would oppose toil and taxis for more american armament and meanwhile the dictatorship would be force the enslave people of old|world conquest into a system be even now organize to build a naval and air force intend to gain and hold and be master of the atlantic and the pacific as well would fasten an economic stranglehold upon several nations quisling would be find to subvert the government in republics and the nazis would back fifth column with invasion if necessary no be not speculate about all this merely repeat what be already in the nazi book of world conquest plan to treat the|latin|american|nation as be now treat the balkans plan then to strangle the|united|states|of|america and the american laborer would have to compete with slave labor in the rest of the world minimum wage maximum hour nonsense wage and hour would be fix by hitler the dignity and power and standard of living of the american worker and farmer would be go trade union would become historical relic and collective bargaining a joke farm income what happen to all farm surplus without any foreign trade the american farmer would get for product exactly what hitler want to give the farmer would face obvious disaster and complete regimentation tariff wall chinese wall of isolation would be futile freedom to trade be essential to economic life do not eat all the food can produce and do not burn all the oil can pump do not use all the good can manufacture would not be an american wall to keep nazi good out would be a nazi wall to keep in the whole fabric of work life as know business and manufacturing mining and agriculture all would be mangle and cripple under such a system yet to maintain even that crippled independence would require permanent conscription of manpower would curtail the fund could spend on education on housing on public work on flood control on health and instead should be permanently pour resource into armament and year in and|year out stand day and night watch against the destruction of city yes even right of worship would be threaten the nazi world do not recognize any god except hitler for the nazis be as ruthless as the communists in the denial of god what place have religion which preach the dignity of the human being the majesty of the human soul in a world where moral standard be measure by treachery and bribery and fifth columnist will child too wander off goose stepping in search of new god do not accept will not permit this nazi shape of thing to come will never be force upon if act in this present crisis with the wisdom and the courage which have distinguish country in all the crisis of the past today the nazis have take military possession of the great part of europe in africa have occupy tripoli and libya and be threaten egypt the|suez|canal and but plan do not stop there for the|indian|ocean be the gateway to the farther east also have the armed power at any moment to occupy spain and portugal and that threat extend not only to french north|africa and the western end of the mediterranean but extend also to the atlantic fortress of dakar and to the island outpost of the|new|world the azores and cape|verde|island the cape|verde|island be only|seven|hours ' distance from brazil by bomber or troop carry plane dominate shipping route to and from the|south|atlantic the war be approach the brink of the|western|hemisphere be come very close to home control or occupation by nazi force of any of the island of the atlantic would jeopardize the immediate safety of portion of north|and|south|america and of the island possession of the|united|state and therefore the ultimate safety of the continental united|stat hitler 's plan of world domination would be near accomplishment today be not for factor be the epic resistance of britain colony and the great dominions fight not only to maintain the existence of the|island|of|britain but also to hold and africa the other be the magnificent defense of china which will have reason to believe increase in strength all of these together be prevent the axis from win control of the sea by ship and aircraft the|axis|power can never achieve objective of world domination unless first obtain control of the sea that be supreme purpose today and to achieve must capture great|britain could then have the power to dictate to the|western|hemisphere no spurious argument no appeal to sentiment no false pledge like those give by hitler at munich can deceive the american people into believe that and axis partner would not with britain defeat close in relentlessly on this hemisphere of but if the|axis|power fail to gain control of the sea then be certainly defeat dream of world domination will then go by the board and the criminal leader who start this war will suffer inevitable disaster both and people know this- and and people be afraid that be why be risk everything have conduct desperate attempt to break through to the command of the ocean once be limit to a continue land war cruel force of occupation will be unable to keep heel on the neck of the million of innocent oppress people on the continent of europe and in the end whole structure will break into little piece and let remember the wide the nazi land effort the great be ultimate danger do not forget the silence people the master of germany have mark these silence people and child 's child for slavery- those at least who have not be assassinate or escape to free soil but those people spiritually unconquered austrians czechs poles norwegians dutch belgians frenchmen greeks southern slavs yes even those italians and germans who have be enslave will prove to be a powerful force in the final disruption of the nazi system all freedom- mean freedom to live and not freedom to conquer and subjugate other people depend on freedom of the sea all of american history north central and south|american history have be inevitably tie up with those word freedom of the sea since when infant navy make the|west|indy and the caribbean and safe for american ship since and when make all peaceful commerce safe from the depredation of the barbary pirate since the|war|of|1812 which be fight for the preservation of sailor ' right since when sea power make possible for the mexicans to expel have strive and fight in defense of freedom of the sea for own shipping for the commerce of sister republics for the right of all nations to use the highway of world trade and for own safety during the first world|war be able to escort merchant ship by the use of small cruiser gunboat and destroyer and that type call a convoy be effective against submarine in this second world|war however the problem be great be different because the attack on the freedom of the sea be now fourfold first the improve submarine second the much great use of the heavily armed raiding cruiser or the hit and run battleship third the bombing airplane which be capable of destroy merchant ship or eight|hundred|miles from near base and fourth the destruction of merchant ship in those port of the world that be accessible to bombing attack the battle of the atlantic now extend from the icy water of the|north|pole to the frozen continent of the antarctic throughout this huge area there have be sinking of merchant ship in alarm and increase number by nazi raider or submarine there have be sinking even of ship carry neutral flag there have be sinking in the|south|atlantic off west|africa and the|cape|verde|islands between the azores and the island off the american coast and between greenland and iceland great number of these sinking have be actually within the water of the|western|hemisphere the blunt truth be this and reveal this with the full knowledge of the|british|government the present rate of nazi sinking of merchant ship be more|than|three time as high as the capacity of british shipyard to replace be more than twice the combine british and american output of merchant ship today can answer this peril by simultaneous measure first by speed up and increase own great shipbuilding program and by help to cut down the loss on the high sea attack on ship off the very shore of land which be determined to protect present an actual military danger to the americas and that danger have recently be heavily underline by the presence in western|hemisphere water of a nazi battleship of great striking power remember that most of the supply for britain go by a northerly route which come close to greenland and the nearby island of iceland germany 's heavy attack be on that route nazi occupation of iceland or basis in greenland would bring the war close to own continental shore because those place be step stone to labrador and newfoundland to nova|scotia yes to the northern united|stat include the great industrial center of the north the east and the|middle|w equally the azores and the|cape|verde|islands if occupy or control by germany would directly endanger the freedom of the atlantic and own american physical safety under german domination those island would become basis for submarine warship and airplane raid the water that lie immediately off own coast and attack the shipping in the|south|atlantic would provide a springboard for actual attack against the integrity and the independence of brazil and neighboring republics have say on many occasion that the|united|stat be muster man and resource only for purpose of defense- only to repel attack repeat that statement now but must be realistic when use the word attack have to relate to the lightning speed of modern warfare some people seem to think that be not attack until bomb actually drop in the street of new|york or san|francisco or new|orleans or chicago but be simply shut eye to the lesson that must learn from the fate of every nation that the nazis have conquer the attack on czechoslovakia begin with the conquest of austria the attack on norway begin with the occupation of denmark the attack on greece begin with occupation of albania and bulgaria the attack on the|suez|canal begin with the invasion of the balkans and north|africa and the attack on the|united|state can begin with the domination of any base which menace security north or south nobody can foretell tonight just when the act of the dictator will ripen into attack on this hemisphere and but know enough by now to realize that would be suicide to wait until be in front yard when enemy come at in a tank or a bombing plane if hold fire until see the white of eye will never know what hit bunker|hill of tomorrow may be several|thousand|miles from boston anyone with an atlas anyone with a reasonable knowledge of the sudden striking force of modern war know that be stupid to wait until a probable enemy have gain a foothold from which to attack old fashioned common sense call for the use of a strategy that will prevent such an enemy from gain a foothold in the first place have accordingly extend patrol in north|and|south|atlantic water be steadily add more and more ship and plane to that patrol be well know that the strength of the|atlantic|fleet have be greatly increase during the|past|year and that be constantly be build up these ship and plane warn of the presence of attack raider on the sea under the sea and above the sea the danger from these raider be of course greatly lessen if location be definitely know be thus be forewarn shall be on guard against effort to establish nazi basis closer to hemisphere the deadly fact of war compel nations for simple self preservation to make stern choice do not make sense for instance to say believe in the defense of all the|western|hemisphere and in the next breath to say will not fight for that defense until the enemy have land on shore if believe in the independence and the integrity of the americas must be willing to fight to fight to defend just as much as would to fight for the safety of own home be time for to realize that the safety of american home even in the center of this own country have a very definite relationship to the continued safety of home in nova|scotia or trinidad or brazil national policy today therefore be this first shall actively resist wherever necessary and with all resource every attempt by hitler to extend nazi domination to the|western|hemisphere or to threaten shall actively resist every attempt to gain control of the sea insist upon the vital importance of keep hitlerism away from any point in the world which could be use or would be use as a base of attack against the americas second from the point of view of strict naval and military necessity shall give every possible assistance to britain and to all who with britain be resist hitlerism or equivalent with force of arm patrol be help now to insure delivery of the need supply to britain all additional measure necessary to deliver the good will be take any and all further method or combination of method which can or should be utilize be be devise by military and naval technician who with will work out and put into effect such new and additional safeguard as may be need say that the delivery of need supply to britain be imperative say that this can be do must be do and will be do to the other american nations- republics and the dominion of canada say this the|united|state do not merely propose these purpose but be actively engage today in carry out say to further may disregard those few citizen of the|united|state who contend that be disunite and can not act there be some timid one among who say that must preserve peace at any price- lest lose liberty forever to say this never in the history of the world have a nation lose democracy by a successful struggle to defend democracy must not be defeat by the fear of the very danger which be prepare to resist freedom have show ability to survive war but freedom would never survive surrender the only thing have to fear be fear there be of course a small group of sincere patriotic man and woman whose real passion for peace have shut eye to the ugly reality of international banditry and to the need to resist at all cost be sure be embarrass by the sinister support be receive from the enemy of democracy in midst the bundists the fascists and communists and every group devote to bigotry and racial and religious intolerance be no mere coincidence that all the argument put forward by these enemy of democracy all attempt to confuse and divide people and to destroy public confidence in government all defeatist foreboding that britain and democracy be already beat all selfish promise that can do business with hitler all of these be but echo of the word that have be pour out from the axis bureaus of propaganda those same word have be use before in other country to scare to divide to soften up invariably those same word have form the advance guard of physical attack government have the right to expect of all citizen that take part in the common work of common defense take loyal part from this moment forward have recently set up the machinery for civilian defense will rapidly organize locality by locality will depend on the organized effort of man and woman everywhere all will have opportunity and responsibility to fulfill defense today mean more than merely fight mean morale civilian as well as military mean use every available resource mean enlarge every useful plant mean the use of a great american common sense in discard rumor and distorted statement mean recognize for what be racketeer and fifth columnist who be the incendiary bomb in this country of the moment all of know that have make very great social progress in recent|years propose to maintain that progress and strengthen when the nation be threaten from without however as be today the actual production and transportation of the machinery of defense must not be interrupt by dispute between capital and capital labor and labor or capital and labor the future of all free enterprise of capital and labor alike be at stake this be no time for capital to make or be allow to retain excess profit article of defense must have undispute right of way in every industrial plant in the country a nation wide machinery for conciliation and mediation of industrial dispute have be set up that machinery must be use promptly and without stoppage of work collective bargaining will be retain but the american people expect that impartial recommendation of government conciliation and mediation service will be follow both by capital and by labor the overwhelming majority of citizen expect government to see that the tool of defense be build and for the very purpose of preserve the democratic safeguard of both labor and management this government be determine to use all of power to express the will of people and to prevent interference with the production of material essential to nation 's security today the whole world be divide between human slavery and human freedom between pagan brutality and the christian ideal choose human freedom which be the christian ideal no one of can waver for a moment in courage or faith will not accept a hitler dominate world and will not accept a world like the postwar world of the 's in which the seed of hitlerism can again be plant and allow to grow will accept only a world consecrate to freedom of speech and expression — freedom of every person to worship god in own way freedom from want and freedom from terror be such a world impossible of attainment magna|charta the declaration of independence the constitution of the|united|state and every

that democracy because of profound respect for the right of man would never arm to fight believe that democracy because of will to live at peace with neighbor could not mobilize energy even in own defense know now that democracy can still remain democracy and speak and reach conclusion and arm adequately for defense from the bureaus of propaganda of the axis power come the confident prophecy

be the common sense of strategy the great task of this|day the deep duty that rest upon each and every of be to move product from the assembly line of factory to the battle line of democracy now can have speed can have effectiveness if maintain exist unity do not have and never will have the false unity of a people browbeat by threat mislead by propaganda be a unity that be possible only among free man and woman who recognize the truth and face reality with intelligence and courage today at last today at long last be not a partial effort be a total effort and that be the only way to guarantee ultimate safety begin a|year|ago start the erection of hundred of plant start the training of million of man then at the moment that the aid to democracy bill be pass this|week be ready to

final extent of those sacrifice will depend on the speed with which act now must tell tonight in plain language what this undertaking mean to to in daily life whether be in the armed service whether be a steel worker or a stevedore a machinist or a housewife a farmer or a banker a storekeeper or a manufacturer to all of will mean sacrifice in behalf of country and liberty yes will feel the impact of this gigantic effort in daily life will feel in a way that will cause to many inconvenience will have to be content with low profit low profit from business because obviously taxis will be high will have to work longer at bench or plow or machine or desk let make clear that the nation be call for the sacrifice of some privilege not for the sacrifice of fundamental right and most of will do willingly that kind of sacrifice be for the common national protection and welfare for defense against the most ruthless brutality in all history for the ultimate victory of a way of life now so violently menace a halfhearted effort on part will lead to failure this be no part time job the concept of business as usual of normalcy must be forget until the task be finish yes be an all out effort and nothing short of an all out effort will win therefore be dedicated from here on to a constantly increase tempo of production a production great than now know or have ever know before a production that do not stop and should not pause tonight be appeal to the heart and to the mind of every man and every woman within border who love liberty ask to consider the need of nation and this|hour to put aside all personal difference until the victory be win the light of democracy must be keep burn to the perpetuation of this light each of must do own share the single effort of individual may seem very small but there be individual overhere and there are|many|more|million in britain and elsewhere bravely shield the great flame of democracy from the blackout of barbarism be not enough for merely to trim the wick or polish the glass the time have come when must provide the fuel in ever increase amount to keep that flame alight there will be no division of party or section or race or nationality or religion there be not among who do not have a stake in the outcome of the effort in which be now engage a|few|weeks|ago speak of freedom freedom of speech and expression freedom of every person to worship god in own way freedom from want freedom from fear be the ultimate stake may not be immediately attainable throughout the world but humanity do move toward those glorious ideal through democratic process and if fail — if democracy be supersede by slavery then those freedom or even the mention of will become forbidden thing century will pass before can be revive by win now strengthen the meaning of those freedom increase the stature of mankind establish the dignity of human life have often think that there be a vast difference between the word loyalty and the word obedience obedience can be obtain and enforce in a dictatorship by the use of threat or extortion or blackmail or can be obtain by a failure on the part of government to tell the truth to citizen loyalty be different spring from the mind that be give the fact that retain ancient ideal and proceed without coercion to give support to own government that be true in england and in greece and in china and in the|united|state today and in many other country million of man and woman be pray for the return of a|day when can give that kind of loyalty loyalty can not be buy dollar alone will not win this war let not delude as to that today nearly a and a half american citizen be hard at work in armed force the spirit the determination of these man of army and navy be worthy of the high tradition of country no well man ever serve under washington or john|paul|jones or grant or lee or pershing that be a boast admit but be not an idle upon the national will to sacrifice and to work depend the output of industry and agriculture upon that will depend the survival of the vital bridge across the ocean the bridge of ship that carry the arm and the food for those who be fight the good fight upon that will depend ability to aid other nations which may determine to offer resistance upon that will may depend practical assistance to people now live in nations that have be overrun should find the opportunity to strike back in an effort to regain liberty and may that day come soon this will of the american people will not be frustrate either by threat from powerful enemy abroad or by small selfish group or individual at home the determination of america must not and will not be obstruct by war profiteering must not be obstruct by unnecessary strike of worker by shortsighted management or by the third danger — deliberate sabotage for unless win there will be no freedom for either management or labor wise labor leader and wise business manager will realize how necessary be to own existence to make common sacrifice for this great common cause there be no longer the slight question or doubt that the american people recognize the extreme seriousness of the present situation that be why have demand and get a policy of unqualified immediate all out aid for britain for greece for china and for all the governments in exile whose homeland be temporarily occupy by the aggressor and from now on that aid will be increase and yet again increase until total victory have be win the british be strong than ever in the magnificent morale that have enable to endure all

be threescore year and a little more a little less the life of a nation be the fullness of the measure of will to live there be man who doubt this there be man who believe that democracy as a form of government and a frame of life be limit or measure by a kind of mystical and artificial fate that for some unexplained reason tyranny and slavery have become the surge wave of the future and that freedom be an ebb tide but americans know that this be not true eight|years|ago when the life of this republic seem freeze by a fatalistic terror prove that this be not true be in the midst of shock but act act quickly boldly decisively these later year have be live year fruitful year for the people of this democracy for have bring to great security and hope a well understanding that life 's ideal be to be measure in other than material thing most vital to present and to future be this experience of a democracy which successfully survive crisis at home put away many evil thing build new

construct an unlimited civilization capable of infinite progress in the improvement of human life know because if look below the surface sense still spread on every continent for be the most humane the most advanced and in the end the most unconquerable of all form of human society a nation like a person have a body a body that must be feed and clothe and house invigorated and rest in a manner that measure up to the standard of time a nation like a person have a mind a mind that must be keep inform and alert that must know that understand the hope and the need of neighbor all the other nations that live within the narrowing circle of the world a nation like a person have something deep something more permanent something large than the sum of all part be that something which matter most to future which call forth the most sacred guarding of present be a thing for which find difficult — even impossible to hit upon a single simple word and yet all understand what be the spirit the faith of america be the product of century be bear in the multitude of those who come from many land some of high degree but mostly plain people who seek here early and late to find freedom more freely the democratic aspiration be no mere recent phase in human history be human history permeate the ancient life of early people blaze anew in the|middle|age be write in magna|charta in the americas impact have be irresistible america have be in all tongue and to all people not because this continent be a new find land but because all those who come here believe could create upon this

first come here to carry out the longing of spirit and the million who follow and the stock that spring from — all have move forward constantly and consistently toward an ideal which in have gain stature and clarity with each generation the hope of the republic can not forever tolerate either undeserved poverty or self serve wealth know that still have far to go that must more greatly build the security and the opportunity and the knowledge of every citizen in the measure justify by the resource and the capacity of the land but be not enough to achieve these purpose alone be not enough to clothe and feed the body of this nation to instruct and inform mind for there be also the spirit and of the the great be the spirit without the body and the mind as all man know the nation could not live but if the spirit of america be kill even though the nation 's body and mind constrict in an alien world live on the america know would have perish that spirit that faith speak to in daily

from the other nations of the hemisphere and from those across the sea the enslave as well as the free sometimes fail to hear or heed these voice of freedom because to the privilege of freedom be such an old old story the destiny of america be proclaim in word of prophecy speak by first president in first inaugural in 1789—words almost direct would seem to this|year|of|1941 the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government be justly consider deeply finally stake on the experiment intrust to the hand of the american people if and in this later day lose that sacred fire if let be smother with doubt and fear then shall reject the destiny which washington strove so valiantly and so triumphantly to establish the preservation of the spirit and faith of the nation do and will furnish the high justification for every sacrifice that may make in the cause of national defense in the face of great peril never before encounter strong purpose be to protect and to perpetuate the integrity of democracy for this muster the spirit of america and the faith of america do not retreat be not content to stand still as americans go forward in the service of country by the will of god view transcript transcript mr. president mr. speaker member of the 77th congress address the member of the 77th congress at a moment unprecedented in the history of the union use the word unprecedented because at no previous time have american security be as seriously threaten from without as be today since the permanent formation of government under the constitution in most of the period of crisis in history have relate to domestic affair fortunately only|one of these the year war between the states — ever threaten national unity today thank god americans in state have forget point of the compass in national unity be true that prior to the united|states often have be disturb by event in other continent have even engage in war with european nation and in a number of undeclared war in the|west|indy in the mediterranean and in the pacific for the maintenance of american right and for the principle of peaceful commerce but in no case have a serious threat be raise against national safety or continued independence what seek to convey be the historic truth that the|united|stat as a nation have at all time maintain clear definite opposition to any attempt to lock in behind an ancient chinese wall while the procession of civilization go past today think of child and of child oppose enforce isolation for or for any other part of the americas that determination of extend over all|these|years be prove for example during of war follow the|french|revolution while the napoleonic struggle do threaten interest of the|united|state because of the french foothold in the|west|indy and in louisiana and while engage in to vindicate right to peaceful trade be nevertheless clear that neither france nor great|britain nor any other nation be aim at domination of the whole world in like fashion from to year no single war in europe or in asia constitute a real threat against future or against the future of any other american nation except in the maximilian interlude in mexico no foreign power seek to establish in this hemisphere and the strength of the british fleet in the atlantic have be a friendly strength be still a friendly strength even when the|world|war break out in seem to contain only small threat of danger to own american future but as time go on the american people begin to visualize what the downfall of democratic nation may mean to own democracy need not overemphasize imperfection in the peace of versailles need not harp on failure of the democracy to deal with problem of world reconstruction should remember that the peace of be far less unjust than the kind of pacification which begin even before munich and which be be carry on under the new order of tyranny that seek to spread over every continent today the american people have unalterably set face against that tyranny every realist know that the democratic way of life be at this moment be directly assail in every part of the world assail either by arm or by secret spreading of poisonous propaganda by those who seek to destroy unity and promote discord in nation that be still at peace during this assault have blot out the whole pattern of democratic life in an appalling number of independent nation great and small the assailant be still on the march threaten other nation great and small therefore as president perform constitutional duty to give to the congress information of the state of the union find unhappily necessary to report that the future and the safety of country and of democracy be overwhelmingly involve in event far beyond border armed defense of democratic existence be now be gallantly wag in continent if that defense fail all the population and all the resource of europe asia africa and australasia will be dominate by the conqueror let remember that the total of those population and resource in those continent greatly exceed the sum total of the population and the resource of the whole of the|western|hemisphere many time over in time like these be immature and incidentally untrue for anybody to brag that an unprepared america single handed and with hand tie behind back can hold off the whole world no realistic american can expect from a dictator 's peace international generosity or return of true independence or world disarmament or freedom of expression or freedom of religion or even good business such a peace would bring no security for or for neighbor those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety as a nation may take pride in the fact that be softhearte but can not afford to be soft head must always be wary of those who with sound brass and a tinkle cymbal preach the ism of appeasement must especially beware of that small group of selfish man who would clip the wing of the american eagle in order to feather own nest have recently point out how quickly the tempo of modern warfare could bring into very midst the physical attack which must eventually expect if the dictator nation win this war there be much loose talk of immunity from immediate and direct invasion from across the sea obviously as long as the british navy retain power no such danger exist even if there be be not probable that any enemy would be stupid enough to attack by land troop in the|united|state from across thousands|of|mile of ocean until have acquire strategic basis from which to operate but learn much from the lesson of the|past|years in europe — particularly the lesson of norway whose essential seaport be capture by treachery and surprise build up over a|series|of|year the first phase of the invasion of this hemisphere would not be the landing of regular troop the necessary strategic point would be occupy by secret agent and dupe — and great number of be already here and in as long as the aggressor nation maintain the offensive — not — will choose the time and the place and the method of attack that be why the future of all the american republic be today in serious danger that be why this annual message to the congress be unique in history that be why every member of the executive branch of the government and every member of the congress face great responsibility and great accountability the need of the moment be that action and policy should be devote primarily — almost exclusively — to meet this foreign peril for all domestic problem be now a part of the great emergency just as national policy in internal affair have be base upon a decent respect for the right and the dignity of all fellow man within gate so national policy in foreign affair have be base on a decent respect for the right and dignity of all nation large and small and the justice of morality must and will win in the end national policy be this first by an impressive expression of the public will and without regard to partisanship be committed to all inclusive national defense second by an impressive expression of the public will and without regard to partisanship be committed to full support of all those resolute people everywhere who be resist aggression and be thereby keep war away from hemisphere by this support express determination that the democratic cause shall prevail and strengthen the defense and the security of own nation third by an impressive expression of the public will and without regard to partisanship be commit to the proposition that principle of morality and consideration for own security will never permit to acquiesce in a peace dictate by aggressor and sponsor by appeaser know that endure peace can not be buy at the cost of other people 's freedom in the recent national election there be no substantial difference between the great party in respect to that national policy no issue be fight out on this line before the american electorate today be abundantly evident that american citizen everywhere be demand and support speedy and complete action in recognition of obvious danger therefore the immediate need be a swift and drive increase in armament production leader of industry and labor have respond to summon goal of speed have be set in some case these goal be be reach ahead of time in some case be on schedule in other case there be slight but not serious delay and in some case and be sorry to say very important case be all concern by the slowness of the accomplishment of plan the army and navy however have make substantial progress during the|past|year actual experience be improve and speed up method of production with every pass day and today 's good be not good enough for tomorrow be not satisfied with the progress thus far make the man in charge of the program represent the good in training in ability and in patriotism be not satisfied with the progress thus far make none of will be satisfied until the job be do no matter whether the original goal be set too high or too low objective be quick and well result to give illustration be behind schedule in turn out finished airplane be work day and night to solve the innumerable problem and to catch up be ahead of schedule in build warship but be work to get even further ahead of that schedule to change a whole nation from a basis of peacetime production of implement of peace to a basis of wartime production of implement of war be no small task and the great difficulty come at the beginning of the program when new tool new plant facility new assembly line and new ship way must first be construct before the actual materiel begin to flow steadily and speedily from the congress of course must rightly keep inform at all time of the progress of the program however there be certain information as the congress will readily recognize which in the interest of own security and those of the nation that be support must of need be keep in confidence new circumstance be constantly beget new need for safety shall ask this congress for greatly increase new appropriation and authorization to carry on what have begin also ask this congress for authority and for fund sufficient to manufacture additional munition and war supply of many kind to be turn over to those nation which be now in actual war with aggressor nation most useful and immediate role be to act as an arsenal for as well as for do not need man power but do need billions|of|dollar worth of the weapon of defense the time be near when will not be able to pay for all in ready cash can not and will not tell that must surrender merely because of present inability to pay for the weapon which know must have do not recommend that make a loan of dollar with which to pay for these weapon a loan to be repay in dollar recommend that make possible for those nation to continue to obtain war material in the|united|state fit order into own program nearly all materiel would if the time ever come be useful for own defense take counsel of expert military and naval authority consider what be good for own security be free to decide how much should be keep here and how much should be send abroad to friend who by determined and heroic resistance be give time in which to make ready own defense for what send abroad shall be repay within a reasonable time follow the close of hostility in similar material or at option in other good of many kind which can produce and which need let say to the democracy americans be vitally concerned in defense of freedom be put forth energy resource and organize power to give the strength to regain and maintain a free world shall send in ever increase number ship plane tank gun this be purpose and pledge in fulfillment of this purpose will not be intimidate by the threat of dictator that will regard as a breach of international law or as an act of war aid to the democracy which dare to resist aggression such aid be not an act of war even if a dictator should unilaterally proclaim so to be when the dictator if the dictator be ready to make war upon will not wait for an act of war on part do not wait for norway or belgium or the netherlands to commit an act of war only interest be in a new way international law which lack mutuality in observance and therefore become an instrument of oppression the happiness of future generation of americans may well depend upon how effective and how immediate can make aid feel no one can tell the exact character of the emergency situation that may be call upon to meet the nation 's hand must not be tie when the nation 's life be in danger must all prepare to make the sacrifice that the emergency — almost as serious as war — demand whatever stand in the way of speed and efficiency in defense preparation must give way to the national need a free nation have the right to expect full cooperation from all group a free nation have the right to look to the leader of business of labor and of agriculture to take the lead in stimulate effort not among other group but within own group the good way of deal with the few slacker or trouble maker in midst be first to shame by patriotic example and if that fail to use the sovereignty of government to save government as man do not live by bread alone do not fight by armament alone those who man defense and those behind who build defense must have the stamina and the courage which come from unshakable belief in the manner of life which be defend the mighty action that be call for can not be base on a disregard of all thing worth fight for the nation take great satisfaction and much strength from the thing which have be do to make people conscious of individual stake in the preservation of democratic life in america those thing have toughen the fibre of people have renew faith and strengthen devotion to the institution make ready to protect certainly this be no time for any of to stop think about the social and economic problem which be the root cause of the social revolution which be today a supreme factor in the world for there be nothing mysterious about the foundation of a healthy and strong democracy the basic thing expect by people of political and economic system be simple be equality of opportunity for youth and for other job for those who can work security for those who need the ending of special privilege for the few the preservation of civil liberty for all the enjoyment of the fruit of scientific progress in a wide and constantly rise standard of living these be the simple basic thing that must never be lose sight of in the turmoil and unbelievable complexity of modern world the inner and abide strength of economic and political system be dependent upon the degree to which fulfill these expectation many subject connect with social economy call for immediate improvement as example should bring more citizen under the coverage of old age pension and unemployment insurance should widen the opportunity for adequate medical care should plan a well system by which person deserve or need gainful employment may obtain have call for personal sacrifice be assure of the willingness of almost all americans to respond to that call a part of the sacrifice mean the payment of more money in taxis in budget message shall recommend that a great portion of this great defense program be pay for from taxation than be pay today no person should try or be allow to get rich out of this program and the principle of tax payment in accordance with ability to pay should be constantly before eye to guide legislation if the congress maintain these principle the voter put patriotism ahead of pocketbook will give applause in the|future|days which seek to make secure look forward to a world found upon essential human freedom the first be freedom of speech and expression everywhere in the world the second be freedom of every person to worship god in own way everywhere in the world the third be freedom from want which translate into world term mean economic understanding which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for inhabitant everywhere in the world the fourth be freedom from fear — which translate into world term mean a world wide reduction of armament to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no

be no end save victory view transcript transcript friend this be not a fireside chat on war be a talk on national security because the nub of the whole purpose of president be to keep now and child later and grandchild much later out of a last ditch war for the preservation of american independence and all of the thing that american independence mean to and to and to tonight in the presence of a world crisis mind go back eight|year to a night in the midst of a domestic crisis be a time when the wheel of american industry be grind to a full stop when the whole banking system of country have cease to function well remember that while sit in study in the|white|house prepare to talk with the people of the|united|state have before eye the picture of all those americans with whom be talk see the workman in the mill the mine the factory the girl behind the counter the small shopkeeper the farmer do spring plow the widow and the old man wonder about life 's saving try to convey to the great mass of american people what the banking crisis mean to in daily life tonight want to do the same thing with the same people in this new crisis which face america meet the issue of with courage and realism face this new crisis this new threat to the security of nation with the same courage and realism never before since jamestown and plymouth|rock have american civilization be in such danger as now for on september|27th,|1940 this|year by an agreement sign in berlin powerful nation in europe and in asia join together in the threat that if interfere with or block the expansion program of these nation a program aim at world control would unite in ultimate action against the|united|state the nazi master of germany have make clear that intend not only to dominate all life and think in own country but also to enslave the whole of europe and then to use the resource of europe to dominate the rest of the world be only|three|weeks|ago leader state this there be world that stand opposed to each other and then in defiant reply to opponent say this other be correct when say with this world can not ever reconcile can beat any other power in the world so say the leader of the nazis in other word the axis not merely admit but the axis proclaim that there can be no ultimate peace between philosophy of government and philosophy of government in view of the nature of this undeniable threat can be assert properly and categorically that the|united|states have no right or reason to encourage talk of peace until the|day shall come when there be a clear intention on the part of the aggressor nation to abandon all thought of dominate or conquer the world at this moment the force of the state that be league against all people who live in freedom be be hold away from shore the germans and the italians be be block on the other side of the atlantic by the british and by the greeks and by thousand of soldier and sailor who be able to escape from subjugated country in asia the japanese be be engage by the chinese nation in another great defense in the|pacific|ocean be fleet some of people like to believe that war in europe and in asia be of no concern to but be a matter of most vital concern to that european and asiatic war maker should not gain control of the ocean which lead to this hemisphere one|hundred|and|seventeen|years|ago the|monroe|doctrine be conceive by government as a measure of defense in the face of a threat against this hemisphere by an alliance in continental|europe thereafter stand on guard in the atlantic with the british as neighbor there be no treaty there be no unwritten agreement and yet there be the feeling prove correct by history that as neighbor could settle any dispute in peaceful fashion and the fact be that during the whole of this time the|western|hemisphere have remain free from aggression from europe or from asia do anyone seriously believe that need to fear attack anywhere in the americas while a free britain remain most powerful naval neighbor in the atlantic and do anyone seriously believe on the other hand that could rest easy if the axis power be neighbor there if great|britain go down the axis power will control the continent of europe asia africa australia and the high sea and will be in a position to bring enormous military and naval resource against this hemisphere be no exaggeration to say that all of in all the americas would be live at the point of a gun a gun load with explosive bullet economic as well as military should enter upon a new and terrible era in which the whole world hemisphere include would be run by threat of brute force and to survive in such a world would have to convert permanently into a militaristic power on the basis of war economy some of like to believe that even if great britain fall be still safe because of the broad expanse of the atlantic and of the pacific but the width of those these ocean be not what be in the|day of clipper ship at point between africa and brazil the distance be less from washington than be from washington to denver colorado five|hour for the late type of bomber and at the north end of the|pacific|ocean|america and asia almost touch each other why even today have plane that which could fly from the|british|isle to new|england and back again without refuel and remember that the range of a the modern bomber be ever be increase during many people in all part of the nation have tell what want to say tonight almost all of express a courageous desire to hear the plain truth about the gravity of the situation telegram however express the attitude of the small minority who want to see no evil and hear no evil even though know in heart that evil exist that telegram beg not to tell again of the ease with which american city could be bomb by any hostile power which have gain basis in this|western|hemisphere the gist of that telegram be please mr. president do not frighten by tell the fact frankly and definitely there be danger ahead danger against which must prepare but well know that can not escape danger or the fear of danger by crawl into bed and pull the cover over head some nation of europe be bind by solemn non - intervention pact with germany other nation be assure by germany that need never fear invasion non - intervention pact or not the fact remain that be attack overrun and throw into the modern form of slavery at an|hour 's notice or even without any notice at all as an exile leader of of these nation say to the other day the notice be a minus quantity be give to government two|hour after german troop have pour into country in a place the fate of these nation tell what mean to live at the point of a nazi gun the nazis have justify such action by various pious fraud of these fraud be the claim that be occupy a nation for the purpose of restore order another be that be occupy or control a nation on the excuse that be protect against the aggression of somebody else for example germany have say that be occupy belgium to save the belgians from the british would then hesitate to say to any south|american country be occupy to protect from aggression by the|united|state belgium today be be use as an invasion base against britain now fight for life and any country in nazi hand would always constitute a jumping off place for german attack on any of the other republic of this hemisphere analyze for yourself the future of other place even nearer to germany if the nazis win could ireland hold out would irish freedom be permit as an amazing pet exception in an unfree world or the|islands|of|the|azore which still fly the flag of portugal after five|centuries and think of hawaii as an outpost of defense in the pacific and yet the azores be close to shore in the atlantic than hawaii be on the other side there be those who say that the axis power would never have any desire to attack the|western|hemisphere that this be the same dangerous form of wishful thinking which have destroy the power of resistance of so many conquered people the plain fact be that the nazis have proclaim time and again that all other race be inferior and therefore subject to order and most important of all the vast resource and wealth of this american hemisphere constitute the most tempting loot in all of the round world let no longer blind to the undeniable fact that the evil force which have crush and undermine and corrupt so many other be already within own gate government know much about and every day be ferret out secret emissary be active in own and in neighboring country seek to stir up suspicion and dissension to cause internal strife try to turn capital against labor and vice versa try to reawaken long slumbering racist and religious enmity which should have no place in this country be active in every group that promote intolerance exploit for own end own natural abhorrence of war these trouble breeder have but purpose be to divide people to divide into hostile group and to destroy unity and shatter will to defend there be also american citizen many of then in high place who unwittingly in most case be aid and abet the work of these agent do not charge these american citizen with be foreign agent but do charge with do exactly the kind of work that the dictator want do in the|united|state these people not only believe that can save own skin by shut eye to the fate of other nation some of go much further than that say that can and should become the friend and even the partner of the axis power some of even suggest that should imitate the method of the dictatorship but americans never can and never will do that the experience of the|past|two|year have prove beyond doubt that no nation can appease the nazis no man can tame a tiger into a kitten by stroke there can be no appeasement with ruthlessness there can be no reasoning with an incendiary bomb know now that a nation can have peace with the nazis only at the price of total surrender even the people of italy have be force to become accomplice of the nazis but at this moment do not know how soon will be embrace to death by ally the american appeaser ignore the warning to be find in the fate of austria czechoslovakia poland norway belgium the netherlands denmark and france tell that the axis power be go to win anyway that all of this bloodshed in the world could be save that the|united|states may just as well throw influence into the scale of a dictated peace and get the good out of that can call a negotiate peace nonsense be a negotiate peace if a gang of outlaw surround community and on threat of extermination make pay tribute to save own skin such a dictated peace would be no peace at all would be only another armistice lead to the most gigantic armament race and the most devastating trade war in all history and in these contest the americas would offer the only real resistance to the axis power with all vaunt efficiency with all and parade of pious purpose in this war there be still in background the concentration camp and the servant of god in chain the history of recent|years prove that the shooting and the chain and the concentration camp be not simply the transient tool but the very altar of modern dictatorship may talk of a new order in the world but what have in mind be only but a revival of the old and the bad tyranny in that there be no liberty no religion no hope the propose new order be the very opposite of or a|united|states of asia be not a government base upon the consent of the govern be not a union of ordinary self respect man and woman to protect and freedom and dignity from oppression be an unholy alliance of power and pelf to dominate and to enslave the human race the british people and ally today be conduct an active war against this unholy alliance own future security be greatly dependent on the outcome of that fight ability to keep out of war be go to be affect by that outcome think in term of today and tomorrow make the direct statement to the american people that there be far less chance of the|united|state get into war if do all can now to support the nation defend against attack by the axis than if acquiesce in defeat submit tamely to an axis victory and wait turn to be the object of attack in another war later on if be to be completely honest with must admit that there be risk in any course may take but deeply believe that the great majority of people agree that the course that advocate involve the least risk now and the great hope for world peace in the future the people of europe who be defend do not ask to do fighting ask for the implement of war the plane the tank the gun the freighter which will enable to fight for liberty and for security emphatically must get these weapon to get to in sufficient volume and quickly enough so that and child will be save the agony and suffering of war which other have have to endure let not the defeatist tell that be too late will never be early tomorrow will be later than today certain fact be self evident in a military sense great|britain and the|british|empire be today the spearhead of resistance to world conquest and be put up a fight which will live forever in the story of human gallantry there be no demand for send an american|expeditionary|force outside own border there be no intention by any member of government to send such a force can therefore nail nail any talk about send army to europe as deliberate untruth national policy be not direct toward war sole purpose be to keep war away from country and away from people democracy 's fight against world conquest be be greatly aid and must be more greatly aid by the rearmament of the|united|state and by send every ounce and every ton of munition and supply that can possibly spare to help the defender who be in the front line and be no more unneutral for to do that than be for sweden russia and other nation near germany to send steel and ore and oil and other war material into germany every|day|in|the|week be plan own defense with the utmost urgency and in vast scale must integrate the war need of britain and the other free nation which be resist aggression this be not a matter of sentiment or of controversial personal opinion be a matter of realistic practical military policy base on the advice of military expert who be in close touch with exist warfare these military and naval expert and the member of the congress and the administration have a single minded purpose the defense of the|united|state this nation be make a great effort to produce everything that be necessary in this emergency and with all possible speed and this great effort require great sacrifice would ask no one to defend a democracy which in turn would not defend everyone in the nation against want and privation the strength of this nation shall not be dilute by the failure of the government to protect the economic well being of all citizen if capacity to produce be limit by machine must ever be remember that these machine be operate by the skill and the stamina of the worker as the government be determine to protect the right of the worker so the nation have a right to expect that the man who man the machine will discharge full responsibility to the urgent need of defense the worker possess the same human dignity and be entitle to the same security of position as the engineer or the manager or the owner for the worker provide the human power that turn out the destroyer and the air)plane and the tank the nation expect defense industry to continue operation without interruption by strike or lockout expect and insist that management and worker will reconcile difference by voluntary or legal mean to continue to produce the supply that be so sorely need and on the economic side of great defense program be as know bend every effort to maintain stability of price and with that the stability of the cost of living nine|days|ago announce the setting up of a more effective organization to direct gigantic effort to increase the production of munition the appropriation of vast sum of money and a well coordinate executive direction of defense effort be not in enough gun plane and ship and many other thing have to be build in the factory and the arsenal of america have to be produce by worker and manager and engineer with the aid of machine which in turn have to be build by hundreds|of|thousand of worker throughout the land in this great work there have be splendid cooperation between the government and industry and labor and be very thankful american industrial genius unmatched throughout all the world in the solution of production problem have be call upon to bring resource and talent into action manufacturer of watch of farm implement of linotype and cash register and automobile and sewing machine and lawn mower and locomotive be now make fuse bomb packing crate telescope mount shell and pistol and tank but all of present effort be not enough must have more ship more gun more plane more of everything and this can only be accomplish if discard the notion of business as usual this job can not be do merely by superimpose on the exist productive facility the add requirement of the nation for defense defense effort must not be block by those who fear the future consequence of surplus plant capacity the possible consequence of failure of defense effort now be much more to be fear and after the present need of defense be past a proper handling of the country 's peacetime need will require all of the new productive capacity if not still more no pessimistic policy about the future of america shall delay the immediate expansion of those industry essential to defense need want to make clear that be the purpose of the nation to build now with all possible speed every machine every arsenal every and factory that need to manufacture defense material have the man the skill the wealth and above all the will be confident that if and when production of consumer or luxury good in certain industry require the use of machine and raw material that be essential for defense purpose then such production must yield and will gladly yield to primary and compelling purpose so appeal to the owner of plant to the manager the worker to own government employee to put every ounce of effort into produce these munition swiftly and without stint and with this appeal give the pledge that all of who be officer of government will devote to the same whole hearted extent to the great task that which lie ahead as plane and ship and gun and shell be produce government with defense expert can then determine how best to use to defend this hemisphere the decision as to how much shall be send abroad and how much shall remain at home must be make on the basis of overall military necessity must be the great arsenal of democracy for this be an emergency as serious as war must apply to task with the same resolution the same sense of urgency the same spirit of patriotism and sacrifice as would show be at war have furnish the british great material support and will furnish far more in the future there will be no bottleneck in determination to aid great|britain no dictator no combination of dictator will weaken that determination by threat of how will construe that determination the british have receive invaluable military support from the heroic greek army and from the force of all the government in exile strength be grow be the strength of man and woman who value freedom more highly than value life believe that the axis power be not go to win this war base that belief on the late and good of information have no excuse for defeatism have every good reason for hope hope for peace yes and hope for the defense of civilization and for the building of a well civilization in the future have the profound conviction that the american people be now determined to put forth a mighty effort than have ever yet make to increase production of all the implement of defense to meet the threat to democratic faith as president of the|united|state call for that national effort call for in the name of this nation which love and honor and which be privileged and proud to serve call upon people with absolute confidence that common cause will greatly succeed view transcript transcript member of the convention friend be very late but have feel that would rather that speak to now than wait until tomorrow be with a very full heart that speak tonight must confess that do so with mixed feeling because find as almost everyone do sooner or later in lifetime in a conflict between deep personal desire for retirement on the hand and that quiet invisible thing call conscience on the other because there be self appoint commentator and interpreter who will seek to misinterpret or question motif speak in a somewhat personal vein and must trust to the good faith and common sense of the american people to accept own good faith and to do own interpreting when in be choose by the voter for a second time as president be firm intention to turn over the responsibility of government to other hand at the end of term that conviction remain with in the presidency follow a period of bleak depression and cover world crisis after another would normally entitle any man to the relaxation that come from honorable retirement during the|spring|of|1939 world event make clear to all but the blind or the partisan that a great war in europe have become not merely a possibility but a probability and that such a war would of necessity deeply affect the future of this nation when the conflict first break out last|september be still intention to announce clearly and simply at an|early|date that under no condition would accept reelection this fact be well known to friend and think be understand by many citizen soon become evident however that such a public statement on part would be unwise from the point of view of sheer public duty as president of the|united|state be clear duty with the aid of the congress to preserve neutrality to shape program of defense to meet rapid change to keep domestic affair adjust to shift world condition and to sustain the policy of be also obvious duty to maintain to the utmost the influence of this mighty nation in effort to prevent the spread of war and to sustain by all legal mean those government threaten by other government which have reject the principle of democracy swiftly move foreign event make necessary swift action at home and beyond the sea plan for national defense have to be expand and adjust to meet new form of warfare american citizen and welfare have to be safeguard in many foreign zone of danger national unity in the|united|state become a cry essential in the face of the development of unbelievable type of espionage and international treachery every|day that pass call for the postponement of personal plan and partisan debate until the late possible moment the normal condition under which would have make public declaration of personal desire be wholly go and so think solely of the national good and of the international scene come to the reluctant conclusion that such declaration should not be make before the national convention be accordingly make to within an|hour after the permanent organization of this convention like any other man be compliment by the honor have do but know will understand the spirit in which say that no call of party alone would prevail upon to accept reelection to the presidency the real decision to be make in these circumstance be not the acceptance of a nomination but rather an ultimate willingness to serve if choose by the electorate of the|united|state many consideration enter into this decision during the|past|few|month with due congressional approval in the|united|state have be take step to implement the total defense of america can not forget that in carry out this program have draft into the service of the nation many man and woman take away from important private affair call suddenly from home and business have ask to leave own work and to contribute skill and experience to the cause of nation as the head of government have ask to do this regardless of party regardless of personal convenience come — answer the call every single of with exception have come to the nation 's capital to serve the nation these people who have place patriotism above all else represent those who have make way to what may be call the top of profession or industry through prove skill and experience but alone could not be enough to meet the need of the time just as a system of national defense base on man power alone without the mechanized equipment of modern warfare be totally insufficient for adequate national defense so also plane and gun and tank be wholly insufficient unless be implement by the power of man train to use such man power consist not only of pilot and gunner and infantry and those who operate tank for every individual in actual combat service be necessary for adequate defense that have ready at hand at|least|four or other train individual organize for non - combat service because of the million of citizen involve in the conduct of defense most right thinking person be agree that some form of selection by draft be as necessary and fair today as be in and nearly every american be willing to do share or share to defend the|united|state be neither just nor efficient to permit that task to fall upon any section or any group for every section and every group depend for existence upon the survival of the nation as a whole lie awake as have on many|night have ask whether have the right as commander in chief of the army and navy to call on man and woman to serve country or to train to serve and at the same time decline to serve country in own personal capacity if be call upon to do so by the people of country in time like these in time of great tension of great crisis the compass of the world narrow to a single fact the fact which dominate world be the fact of armed aggression the fact of successful armed aggression aim at the form of government the kind of society that in the|united|state have choose and establish for be a fact which no one long doubt which no one be longer able to ignore be not an ordinary war be a revolution impose by force of arm which threaten all man everywhere be a revolution which propose not to set man free but to reduce to slavery to reduce to slavery in the interest of a dictatorship which have already show the nature and the extent of the advantage which hope to obtain that be the fact which dominate world and which dominate the life of all of each and every of in the face of the danger which confront time no individual retain or can hope to retain the right of personal choice which free man enjoy in time of peace have a first obligation to serve in the defense of institution of freedom a first obligation to serve country in whatever capacity country find useful like most man of age have make plan for plan for a private life of own choice and for own satisfaction a life of that kind to begin in january,|1941 these plan like so many other plan have be make in a world which now seem as distant as another planet today all private plan all private life have be in a sense repeal by an overriding public danger in the face of that public danger all those who can be of service to the republic have no choice but to offer for service in those capacity for which may be fit those friend be the reason why have have to admit to and now to state to that conscience will not let turn back upon a call to service the right to make that call rest with the people through the american method of a free election only the people can draft a president if such a draft should be make upon say to in the utmost simplicity will with god 's help continue to serve with the good of ability and with the fullness of strength to the delegate of this convention express gratitude for the selection of for the high office of vice president of the|united|state first hand knowledge of the problem of government in every sphere of life and in every single part of the nation and indeed of the whole world qualify without reservation practical idealism will be of great service to individually and to the nation as a whole and to the chairman of the|national|committee the|postmaster|general of the|united|state old friend jim|farley send as have often before and shall many time again most affectionate greeting all of be sure that will continue to give all the leadership and support that possibly can to the cause of american democracy in some respect as think good wife suggest an|hour or so ago — the|next|few|month will be different from the usual national campaign of recent|year most of know how important be that the president of the|united|state in these|day remain close to the seat of government since last|summer have be compel to abandon propose journey to inspect many of great national project from the alleghenies to the|pacific|coast event move so fast in other part of the world that have be come duty to remain either in the|white|house or at some near by point where can reach washington and even europe and asia by direct telephone where if nee be can be back at desk in the space of a|very|few|hours and in addition the splendid work of the new defense machinery will require to spend vastly more time in conference with the responsible administration head under finally the add task which the present crisis have impose also upon the congress compel to forego usual adjournment call for constant cooperation between the executive and legislative branch to the efficiency of which be glad indeed now to pay tribute do expect of course during the|coming|months to make usual periodic report to the country through the medium of press conference and radio talk shall not have the time or the inclination to engage in purely political debate but shall never be loath to call the attention of the nation to deliberate or unwitting falsification of fact which be sometimes make by political candidate have speak to in a very informal and personal way the exigency of the day require however that also talk with about thing which transcend any personality and go very deeply to the root of american civilization life have be base on those fundamental freedom and liberty which americans have cherish for a|century|and|a|half the establishment of and the preservation of in each succeed generation have be accomplish through the process of free elective government the democratic republican form base on the representative system and the coordination of the executive the legislative and the judicial branch the task of safeguard institution seem to to be twofold one must be accomplish if become necessary by the armed defense force of the nation the other by the united effort of the man and woman of the country to make federal|and|state and local government responsive to the grow requirement of modern democracy there have be occasion as remember when reaction in the march of democracy have set in and forward look progress have seem to stop but such period have be follow by liberal and progressive time which have enable the nation to catch up with new development in fulfil new human need such a time have be because have seem to lag in previous|years have have to develop speedily and efficiently the answer to aspiration which have come from every state and every family in the land have sometimes call social legislation have sometimes call legislation to end the abuse of the past have sometimes call legislation for human security and have sometimes call legislation to better the condition of life of the|many|millions of fellow citizen who could not have the essential of life or hope for an american standard of living some of have label a wide and more equitable distribution of wealth in land have include among aim to liberalize and broaden the control of vast industry lodge today in the hand of a relatively small group of individual of very great financial power but all of these definition and label be essentially the expression of consistent thought represent a constantly grow sense of human decency human decency throughout nation this sense of human decency be happily confine to no group or class find in the humble home find among those who toil and among the shopkeeper and the farmer of the nation find to a grow degree even among those who be list in that top group which have so much control over the industrial and financial structure of the nation therefore this urge of humanity can by no mean be label a war of class against class be rather a war against poverty and suffering and ill health and insecurity a war in which all class be join in the interest of a sound and endure democracy do not believe for a moment and know that do not believe either that have fully answer all the need of human security but have cover much of the road need not catalogue the milestone of seven|year for every individual and every family in the whole land know that the average of personal life have be make safe and sounder and happy than have ever be before do not think want the gain in these direction to be repeal or even to be place in the charge of those who would give mere lip service with no heart service yes very much more remain to be do and think the voter want the task entrust to those who believe that the word human betterment apply to poor and rich alike and have a sneak suspicion too that voter will smile at charge of inefficiency against a government which have boldly meet the enormous problem of banking and finance and industry which the great efficient banker and industrialist of leave in such hopeless chaos in but all know that progress at home and in the other american nation toward this realization of a well human decency progress along free line be gravely endanger by what be happen on other continent in europe many nation through dictatorship or invasion have be compel to abandon normal democratic process have be compel to adopt form of government which some call new and efficient be not new friend be only a relapse a relapse into ancient history the omnipotent ruler of the great part of modern europe have guarantee efficiency and work and a type of security but the slave who build the pyramid for the glory of the dictator pharaohs of egypt have that kind of security that kind of efficiency that kind of corporative state so do the inhabitant of that world which extend from britain to persia under the undisputed rule of the proconsuls send out from rome so do the henchman the tradesman the mercenary and the slave of the feudal system which dominate europe a year ago so do the people of those nation of europe who receive king and government at the whim of the conquer napoleon whatever new trapping and new slogan tyranny be the old and most discredit rule know to history and whenever tyranny have replace a more human form of government have be due more to internal cause than external democracy can thrive only when enlist the devotion of those whom lincoln call the common people democracy can hold that devotion only when adequately respect dignity by so order society as to assure to the masse of man and woman reasonable security and hope for and for child in democracy and those who live in still unconquered democracy will never willingly descend to any form of this so call security of efficiency which call for the abandonment of other security more vital to the dignity of man be credo unshakable to the end that must live under the liberty that be first herald by magna|carta and place into glorious operation through the|declaration|of|independence the constitution of the|united|state and the|bill|of|right the government of the|united|state for the|past|seven|years have have the courage openly to oppose by every peaceful mean the spread of the dictator form of government if government should pass to other hand next|january untried hand inexperienced hand — can merely hope and pray that will not substitute appeasement and compromise with those who seek to destroy all democracy everywhere include here would not undo if could the effort make to prevent war from the moment be threaten and to restrict the area of carnage down to the|last|minute do not now soften the condemnation express by secretary hull and from time to time for the act of aggression that have wipe out ancient liberty loving peace pursue country which have scrupulously maintain neutrality do not recant the sentiment of sympathy with all free people resist such aggression or begrudge the material aid that have give to do not regret consistent endeavor to awaken this country to the menace for and for all hold dear have pursue these effort in the face of appeaser fifth columnist who charge with hysteria and war mongering but feel duty simple plain inescapable duty to arouse countryman to the danger of the new force let loose in the world so long as be president will do all can to insure that that foreign policy remain foreign policy all that have do to maintain the peace of this country and to prepare morally as well as physically for whatever contingency may be in store submit to the judgment of countryman face of the great choice of history be not alone a choice of government by the people versus dictatorship be not alone a choice of freedom versus slavery be not alone a choice between move forward or fall back be all of these roll into be the continuance of civilization as know versus the ultimate destruction of all that have hold dear religion against godlessness the ideal of justice against the practice of force moral decency versus the fire squad courage to speak out and to act versus the false lullaby of appeasement but have be well say that a selfish and greedy people can not be free the american people must decide whether these thing be worth make sacrifice of money of energy and of self will not decide by listen to mere word or by read mere pledge interpretation and claim will decide on the record the record as have be make — the record of thing as be the american people will sustain the progress of a representative democracy ask the|divine|bless as face the future with courage and with faith view transcript transcript president newcomb friend of the|university|of|virginia notice by the program that be ask to address the class of avail of that privilege but also take this very apt occasion to speak to many other class that have graduate through all the year class that be still in the period of study not alone in the school of learning of the nation but class that have come up through the great school of experience in other word a cross section of the country just as who graduate today be a cross section of the nation as a whole every generation of young man and woman in america have question to ask the world most of the time be the simple but nevertheless difficult question question of work to do opportunity to find ambition to satisfy but every now and again in the history of the republic a different kind of question present a question that ask not about the future of an individual or even of a generation but about the future of the country the future of the american people there be such a time at the beginning of history as a nation young people ask in those|day what lie ahead not for but for the new united|state there be such a time again in the seemingly endless year of the states young man and young woman on both side of the line ask not what trade or profession would enter what live would make but what be to become of the country have know there be such a time again today again today the young man and the young woman of america ask with earnestness and with deep concern this same question what be to become of the country know now ask with even great anxiety than before ask not only what the future hold for this republic but what the future hold for all people and all nation that have be live under democratic form of government under the free institution of a free people be understandable to all of that should ask this question read the word of those who be tell that the ideal of individual liberty the ideal of free franchise the ideal of peace through justice be decadent ideal read the word and hear the boast of those who say that a belief in force force direct by self choose leader be the new and vigorous system which will overrun the earth have see the ascendancy of this philosophy of force in nation after nation where free institution and individual liberty be once maintain be natural and understandable that the young generation should first ask what the extension of the philosophy of force to all the world would lead to ultimately see today in stark reality some of the consequence of what call the machine age where control of machine have be retain in the hand of mankind as a whole untold benefit have accrue to mankind for mankind be then the master and the machine be the servant but in this new system of force the mastery of the machine be not in the hand of mankind be in the control of infinitely small group of individual who rule without a single of the democratic sanction that have know the machine in hand of irresponsible conqueror become the master mankind be not only the servant be the victim too such mastery abandon with deliberate contempt all the moral value to which even this young country for more|than|three|hundred|year have be accustom and dedicated surely the new philosophy prove from month to month that could have no possible conception of the way of life or the way of thought of a nation whose origin go back to jamestown|and|plymouth|rock conversely neither those who spring from that ancient stock nor those who have come hither in later|years can be indifferent to the destruction of freedom in ancestral land across the sea perception of danger to institution may come slowly or may come with a rush and a shock as have to the people of the|united|state in the|past|few|month this perception of danger have come to clearly and overwhelmingly and perceive the peril in a world wide arena an arena that may become so narrowed that only the americas will retain the ancient faith some indeed still hold to the now somewhat obvious delusion that of the|united|state can safely permit the|united|state to become a lone island a lone island in a world dominate by the philosophy of force such an island may be the dream of those who still talk and vote as isolationist such an island represent to and to the overwhelming majority of americans today a helpless nightmare of a people without freedom the nightmare of a people lodge in prison handcuffed hungry and feed through the|bars|from|day|to|day by the contemptuous unpitye master of other continent be natural also that should ask how now can prevent the building of that prison and the placing of in the midst of let not hesitate all of to proclaim certain truth overwhelmingly as a nation and this apply to all the other american nation be convinced that military and naval victory for the god of force and hate would endanger the institution of democracy in the western world and that equally therefore the whole of sympathy lie with those nation that be give life blood in combat against these force the people and the government of the|united|state have see with the utmost regret and with grave disquiet the decision of the|italian|government to engage in the hostility now rage in europe more than the chief of the|italian|government send word that because of the determination of italy to limit so far as may be possible the spread of the european conflict more|than|two|hundred|million of people in the region of the mediterranean have be enable to escape the suffering and the devastation of war inform the chief of the|italian|government that this desire on the part of italy to prevent the war from spread meet with full sympathy and response on the part of the government and the people of the|united|state and express the earnest hope of this government and of this people that this policy on the part of italy may be continue make clear that in the opinion of the|government|of|the|united|state any extension of hostility in the region of the mediterranean may result in a still great enlargement of the scene of the conflict the conflict in and in africa and that if this come to pass no one could foretell how much great the theater of the war eventually may become again on a subsequent occasion not so long ago recognize that certain aspiration of italy may form the basis of discussion among the power most specifically concern offer in a message address to the chief of the|italian|government to send to the government of france and of such specific indication of the desire of italy to obtain readjustment with regard to position as the chief of the|italian|government may desire to transmit through while make clear that the|government|of|the|united|state in such an event could not and would not assume responsibility for the nature of the proposal submit nor for agreement which may thereafter be reach propose that if italy would refrain from enter the war would be willing to ask assurance from the other power concern that would faithfully execute any agreement so reach and that italy 's voice in any future peace conference would have the same authority as if italy have actually take part in the war as a belligerent unfortunately to the regret of all of and the regret of humanity the chief of the|italian|government be unwilling to accept the procedure suggest and have make no counter proposal this government direct effort to do what could to work for the preservation of peace in the mediterranean area and likewise express willingness to endeavor to cooperate with the|government|of|italy when the appropriate occasion arise for the creation of a more stable world order through the reduction of armament and through the construction of a more liberal international economic system which would assure to all power equality of opportunity in the world 's market and in the securing of raw material on equal term have likewise of course feel necessary in communication to signor|mussolini to express the concern of the|government|of the|united|state because of the fact that any extension of the war in the region of the mediterranean would inevitably result in great prejudice to the way of life and government and to the trade and commerce of all the american republics the government of italy have now choose to preserve what term freedom of action and to fulfill what state be promise to germany in so do have manifest disregard for the right and security of other nation disregard for the life of the people of those nation which be directly threaten by this spread of the war and have evidence unwillingness to find the mean through pacific negotiation for the satisfaction of what believe be legitimate aspiration on the hand that hold the dagger have strike into the back of neighbor on in this university found by the first great american teacher of democracy send forth prayer and hope to those beyond the sea who be maintain with magnificent valor battle for freedom in american unity will pursue obvious and simultaneous course will extend to the opponent of force the material resource of this nation and at the same time will harness and speed up the use of those resource in order that in the americas may have equipment and training equal to the task of any emergency and every defense all road lead to the accomplishment of these objective must be keep clear of obstruction will not slow down or detour sign and signal call for speed full speed ahead be right that each new generation should ask question but in recent|months the principal question have be somewhat simplify once more the future of the nation and of the american people be at stake need not and will not in any way abandon continue effort to make democracy work within border still insist on the need for vast improvement in own social and economic life but that be a component part of national defense the program unfold swiftly and into that program will fit the responsibility and the opportunity of every man and woman in the land to preserve and heritage in day of peril call for effort courage sacrifice devotion grant the love of freedom all of these be possible and the love of freedom be still fierce and steady in the nation today view transcript transcript friend at this moment of sadness throughout most of the world want to talk with about a number of subject that directly affect the future of the|united|state be shock by the almost incredible eyewitness story that come to story of what be happen at this moment to the civilian population of norway and holland and belgium and luxembourg and france think be right on this sabbath evening that should say a word in behalf of woman and child and old man who need help immediate help in present distress help from across the sea help from who be still free to give tonight over the once peaceful road of belgium and france million be now move run from home to escape bomb and shell and fire and machine gunning without shelter and almost wholly without food stumble on know not where the end of the road will be remind speak to of these people because each of that be listen to tonight have a way of help which that represent each of be rush food and clothing and medical supply to these destitute civilian million please beg please give accord to mean to near red|cross chapter give as generously as can ask this in the name of common humanity let sit down again together again and to consider own press problem that confront there be many among who in the past close eye to event abroad believe in utter good faith what some of fellow americans tell that what be take place in europe be none of business that no matter what happen over there the|united|states could always pursue peaceful and unique course in the world there be many among who close eye from lack of interest or lack of knowledge honestly and sincerely think that of salt water make the|american|hemisphere so remote that the people of north and central and south america could go on live in the midst of vast resource without reference to or danger from other continents|of the world there be some among who be persuade by minority group that could maintain physical safety by retire within continental boundary the atlantic on the east the pacific on the west canada on the north and mexico on the south illustrate the futility the impossibility of that idea in message to the congress last|week obviously a defense policy base on that be merely to invite future attack and finally there be a few among who have deliberately and consciously close eye because be determine to be oppose to government foreign policy and every other policy to be partisan and to believe that anything that the government do be wholly wrong to those who have close eye for any of these many reason to those who would not admit the possibility of the approach storm to all of the|past|two|week have mean the shattering of many illusion have lose the illusion that be remote and isolated and therefore secure against the danger from which no other land be free in some|quarters with this rude awakening have come fear fear border on panic be say that be defenseless be whisper by some that only by abandon freedom ideal way of life can build defense adequately can match the strength of the aggressor do not share those illusion do not share these fear today be now more realistic but let not be calamity howler and discount strength let have do with both fear and illusion on this sabbath evening in home in the midst of american family let calmly consider what have do and what must do in the|past|two|or|three|week all kind of story have be hand out to the american public about lack of preparedness have even be charge that the money have spend on military and naval force during the|last|few|year have go down the rat hole think that be a matter of fairness to the nation that hear the fact yes have spend large sum of money on the national defense this money have be use to make army and navy today the large the best equipped and the best train peace time military establishment in the whole history of this country let tell just a few of the many thing accomplish during the|past|few|year do not propose can not to go into every detail be a know fact however that in when this administration come into office the|united|states|navy have fall in stand among the navy of the world in power of ship and in efficiency to a relatively low ebb the relative fighting power on the navy have be greatly diminish by failure to replace ship and equipment which have become out of date but between|1933|and|this|year seven|fiscal|year government will have spend a four|hundre dollar more than spend on the navy during the|seven|years before that precede what do get for the money money incidentally not include in the new defense appropriation only the money heretofore appropriate the fighting personnel of the navy rise from to during this period ship for the fighting fleet have be lay down or commission practically time the number in the precede similar seven|year|period of these ship have commission cruiser destroyer submarine aircraft carrier gunboat auxiliary and many small craft and among the many ship now be build and pay for as build be new battleship ship construction of course cost millions|of|dollar more in the|united|state than anywhere else in the world but be a fact that can not have adequate navy defense for all american water without ship ship that sail the surface of the ocean ship that move under the surface and ship that move through the air and speak of airplane airplane that work with the navy in have of useful aircraft and today have on hand and on order of course nearly all of the old plane of plane have be replace by new plane because become obsolete or wear out the navy be far strong today than at any peace time period in the whole long history of the nation in hit power and in efficiency would even make the assertion that be strong today than be during the|world|war the|army|of|the|united|state in consist of enlist man now in that number have be practically double the army of have be give few new implement of war since and have be compel to draw on old reserve stock leave over from the|world|war the net result of all this be that army by l933 have very greatly decline in ratio of strength with the army of europe and of the|far|east that be the situation find but since then great change have take place between|1933|and|1940 these|past|seven|fiscal|year government will have spend more than spend on the army what do get for this money the personnel of the army as have say have be almost double and by every exist unit of the present regular army will be equip with complete requirement of modern weapon exist unit of the|national|guard will also be largely equip with similar item here be some striking example take from a large number of since have actually purchase airplane include the most modern type of long range bomber and fast pursuit plane though of course many of these which be deliver and and or and have wear out through use and be scrap must remember that these plane cost money a lot of for example modern engine long range bombing plane cost modern interceptor pursuit plane cost medium bomber cost to go on in have only|355 anti - aircraft gun now have modern anti - craft gun of all type on hand or on order and ought to know that a inch anti - aircraft gun cost without any of the fire control equipment that go with in there be modern infantry mortar in the entire army now have on hand and on order more|than|1,600 in have modern tank and armored car today have on hand and on order each of heavy tank cost there be many other item in which progress since have be rapid and the great proportion of this advance have be during the|last|two|year consist of really modern equipment for instance in on the personnel side have army pilot today the army alone have of the good fighting flyer in the world flyer who last|year fly more than hour in combat training this and that figure do not include the hundred of splendid pilot in the|national|guard and in the organized reserve within the|past|year the productive capacity of the aviation industry to produce military plane have be tremendously increase in the|past|year the capacity more than double but this that capacity today however be still inadequate but the government work with industry be determined to increase this that capacity to meet need intend to harness the efficient machinery of these manufacturer to the government 's program of be able to get plane a year additional word about aircraft about which read so much recent war include the current war in europe have demonstrate beyond doubt that fight efficiency depend on unity of command unity of control in sea operation the airplane be just as much an integral part of the unity of operation as be the submarine the destroyer and the battleship and in land warfare the airplane be just as much a part of military operation as be the tank corps the engineer the artillery or the infantry therefore the air force should continue to be part of the army and navy in line with request the congress this|week be vote the large appropriation ever ask by the army or the navy in peacetime and the equipment and training provide by for will be in addition to the figure have give the world situation may so change that will be necessary to reappraise program at any time and in such case be confident that the congress and the chief executive will work in harmony as a team work in harmony as be do today will not hesitate at any moment to ask for additional fund when be require in this|era of swift mechanized warfare all have to remember that what be modern today and up to date what be efficient and practical become obsolete and outworn tomorrow even while the production line turn out airplane new airplane ones)are be design on the drafting table even as a cruiser slide down the launch way plan for improvement plan for increase efficiency in the next model be take shape in the blueprint of designer every day 's fighting in europe on land on sea and in the air disclose constant change in method of warfare be constantly improve and redesign test new weapon learn the lesson of the immediate war and seek to produce in accordance with the late that the brain on science can conceive yes be call upon the resource the efficiency and the ingenuity of the american manufacturer of war material of all kind airplane and tank and gun and ship and all the hundred of product that go into this material the|government|of|the|united|states manufacture few of the implement of war private industry will continue to be the source of most of this material and private industry will have to be speed up to produce at the rate and efficiency call for by the need of the time know that private business can not be expect to make all of the capital investment require for expansion of plant and factory and personnel which this program call for at once would be unfair to expect industrial corporation or investor to do this when there be a chance that a change in international affair may stop or curtail future order a year or hence therefore the government of the|united|state stand ready to advance the necessary money to help provide for the enlargement of factory the establishment of new plant the employment of thousand of necessary worker the development of new source of supply for the hundred of raw material require the development of quick mass transportation of supply and the detail of all of this be now be work out in washington day and night be call on man now engage in private industry to help in carry out this program and will hear more of this in detail in the|next|few|day this do not mean that the man call upon will be engage in the actual production of this material that will still have to be carry on in the plant and factory throughout the land private industry will have the responsibility of provide the good speedy and most efficient mass production of which be capable the function of the businessman whose assistance be call upon will be to coordinate this program to see to that all of the plant continue to operate at maximum speed and efficiency patriotic americans of prove merit and of unquestioned ability in special field be come to washington to help the government with training experience and capability be purpose not only to speed up production but to increase the total facility of the nation in such a way that can be further enlarge to meet emergency of the future but as this program proceed there be several thing must continue to watch and safeguard thing which be just as important to the sound defense of a nation as physical armament while navy and airplane and gun and ship may be first line of defense be still clear that way down at the bottom underlie all give strength sustenance and power be the spirit and morale of a free people for that reason must make sure in all that do that there be no breakdown or cancellation of any of the great social gain which have make in these|past|years have carry on an offensive on a broad front against social and economic inequality and abuse which have make society weak that offensive should not now be break down by the pincer movement of those who would use the present need of physical military defense to destroy there be nothing in present emergency to justify make the worker of nation toll for longer|hour than now limit by statute as more order come in and as more work have to be do tens|of|thousand of people who be now unemployed will believe receive employment there be nothing in present emergency to justify a lowering of the standard of employment minimum wage should not be reduce be hope indeed that the new speed up of production will cause many business which now pay below the minimum standard to bring wage up there be nothing in present emergency to justify a breaking down of old age pension or of unemployment insurance would rather see the system extend to other group who do not now enjoy there be nothing in present emergency to justify a retreat from any of social objective from conservation of natural resource assistance to agriculture housing and help to the underprivileged conversely however be sure that responsible leader will not permit some specialized group which represent a minority of the total employee of a plant or an industry to break up the continuity of employment of the majority of the employee let remember that the policy and the law that provide provide for collective bargaining be still in force and can assure that labor will be adequately represent in washington in this defense program the carrying out of this program of defense and more point on this also present emergency and a common sense of decency make imperative that no new group of war millionaire shall come into being in this nation as a result of the struggle abroad the american people will not relish the idea of any american citizen grow rich and fat in an emergency of blood and slaughter and human suffering and finally last of all this emergency demand that the consumer of america be protect so that general cost of living can be maintain at a reasonable level ought to avoid the spiral process of the|world|war the rise spiral of cost of all kind the sound policy be for every employer in the country to help give useful employment to the million who be unemployed by give to those million an increase purchasing power the prosperity of the whole country nation will rise to a much high level today 's threat to national security be not a matter of military weapon alone know of new other method new method of attack the trojan horse the fifth column that betray a nation unprepared for treachery spy saboteur and traitor be the actor in this new strategy with all of these must and will deal vigorously but there be an added technique for weaken a nation at very root for disrupt the entire pattern of life of a people and be important that understand the method be simple be first discord a dissemination of discord a group --not too large a group that may be sectional or racial or political be encourage to exploit prejudice through false slogan and emotional appeal the aim of those who deliberately egg on these group be to create confusion of counsel public indecision political paralysis and eventually a state of panic sound national policy come to be view with a new and unreasoning skepticism not through the wholesome political debate of honest and free man but through the clever scheme of foreign agent as a result of these new technique armament program may be dangerously delay singleness of national purpose may be undermine man can lose confidence in each other and therefore lose confidence in the efficacy of own united action faith and courage can yield to doubt and fear the unity of the state be can be so sap that strength be destroy all this be no idle dream have happen time after time in nation after nation during here in the|last|two|year fortunately american man and woman be not easy dupe campaign of group hatred or class struggle have never make much headway among and be not make headway now but new force be be unleashed deliberately plan propaganda to divide and weaken in the face of danger as other nation have be weaken before these divide force be do not hesitate to call undiluted poison must not be allow to spread in the new world as have in the old moral and mental defense must be raise up as never before against those who would cast a smoke screen across vision the development of defense program make essential that each and every of man and woman feel that have some contribution to make toward the security of country nation at this time when the world and the world include own american|hemisphere when the world be threaten by force of destruction be resolve and to build up armed defense shall build to whatever height the future may require shall rebuild swiftly as the method of warfare swiftly change for more|than|three|centurie americans have be build on this continent a free society a society in which the promise of the human spirit may find fulfillment commingle here be the blood and genius of all the people of the world who have seek this promise have build well be continue effort to bring the blessing of a free society of a free and productive economic system to every family in the land this be the promise of america be this that must continue to build this that must continue to defend be the task of generation your and but build and defend not for generation alone defend the foundation lay down by father build a life for generation yet unborn defend and build a way of life not for america alone but for all mankind be a high duty a noble task day and night pray for the restoration of peace in this mad world of be not necessary that the president ask the american people to pray in behalf of such a cause for know be pray with be certain that out of the heart of every man woman and child in this land in every|waking|minute a supplication go up to almighty god that all of beg that suffer and starving that death and destruction may end and that peace may return to the world in common affection for all mankind prayer join with mine that god will heal the wound and the heart of humanity view transcript transcript fellow americans and friend tonight single duty be to speak to the whole of america until this|morning have hope against hope that some miracle would prevent a devastating war in europe and bring to an end the invasion of poland by germany for four|long|years a succession of actual war and constant crisis have shake the entire world and have threaten in each case to bring on the gigantic conflict which be today unhappily a fact be right that should recall to mind the consistent and at time successful effort of government in these crisis to throw the full weight of the|united|state into the cause of peace in spite of spread war think that have every right and every reason to maintain as a national policy the fundamental morality the teaching of religion and the continuation of effort to restore peace for because some|day though the time may be distant can be of even great help to a crippled humanity be right too to point out that the unfortunate event of these|recent|year have without question be base on the use of force or and the threat of force and seem to clear even at the outbreak of this great war that the influence of america should be consistent in seek for humanity a final peace which will eliminate as far as be possible to do so the continue use of force between nation be of course impossible to predict the future have constant stream of information from american representative and other source throughout the world the people of this country be receive news through radio and newspaper at be believe the most enlightened and the best informed people in all the world at this moment be subject to no censorship of news and want to add that government have no information which hesitate to withhold from or which have any thought of withholding from at the same time as tell press|conference on friday be of the high importance that the press and the radio use the utmost caution to discriminate between actual verify fact on the hand and mere rumor on the other can add to that by say that hope the people of this country will also discriminate most carefully between news and rumor do not believe of necessity everything hear or read check up on first must master at the outset a simple but unalterable fact in modern foreign relation between nation when peace have be break anywhere the peace of all country everywhere be in danger be easy for and for to shrug shoulder and to say that conflict take place thousands|of|miles from the continental united|stat and indeed thousands|of|mile from the whole american|hemisphere do not seriously affect the americas and that all the|united|state have to do be to ignore and go about own business passionately though may desire detachment be force to realize that every word that come through the air every ship that sail the sea every battle that be fight do affect the american future let no man or woman thoughtlessly or falsely talk of america send army to european field at this moment there be be prepare a proclamation of american neutrality this would have be do even if there have be no neutrality statute on the book for this proclamation be in accordance with international law and in accordance with american policy this will be follow by a proclamation require by the exist neutrality act and trust that in the|day to come neutrality can be make a true neutrality be of the utmost importance that the people of this country with the good information in the world think thing through the most dangerous enemy of american peace be those who without well round information on the whole broad subject of the past the present and the future undertake to speak with assumed authority to talk in term of glitter generality to give to the nation assurance or prophecy which be of little present or future value can not and do not prophesy the course of event abroad and the reason be that because have of necessity such a complete picture of what be go on in every part of the world that do not dare to do so and the other reason be that think be honest for to be honest with the people of the|united|state can not prophesy the immediate economic effect of this new war on nation but do say that no american have the moral right to profiteer at the expense either of fellow citizen or of the man the woman and the child who be live and die in the midst of war in europe some thing do know most of in the|united|state believe in spiritual value most of regardless of what church belong to believe in the spirit of a great teaching which oppose to the use of force of armed force of march army and fall bomb the overwhelming masse of people seek peace peace at home and the kind of peace in other land which will not jeopardize peace at home have certain idea and certain ideal of national safety and must act to preserve that safety today and to preserve the safety of child in future|year that safety be and will be bind up with the safety of the|western|hemisphere and of the sea adjacent thereto seek to keep war from own fireside by keep war from come to the americas for that have historic precedent that go back to the day of the administration of president george|washington be serious enough and tragic enough to every american family in every state in the union to live in a world that be tear by war on other continent and those war today affect every american home be national duty to use every effort to keep those war out of the americas and at this time let make the simple plea that partisanship and selfishness be adjourn and that national unity be the thought that underlie all other this nation will remain a neutral nation but can not ask that every american remain neutral in thought as well even a neutral have a right to take account of fact even a neutral can not be ask to close mind or close conscience have say not once but many time that have see war and that hate war say that again and again hope the|united|state will keep out of this war believe that will and give assurance( and reassurance that every effort of government will be direct toward that end as long as remain within power to prevent there will be no blackout of peace in the|united|state view transcript transcript governor davey senator bulkley chairman white and the people of the northwest territory long before there be white man here spy out this land of canaan an intrepid outpost breed be the scout and the skirmisher of the great american migration the sight of smoke from neighbor ' chimney may have worry but indians and redcoat do not long before at kaskaskia and vincennes with scant help from the seaboard have hold beloved wilderness for and for with own bare hand and own long rifle but symbol be vincennes not marietta here with all honor to the scout and the skirmisher celebrate the coming of a different type of man and woman the first battalion of that organize army of occupation which transplant from over the alleghenies whole little civilization that take root and grow be give expression to a genius for organized colonization carefully plan and order under law the man who come here before come as leif|ericson 's man to vineland in a spirit all of adventure but the man and woman of the|ohio|company who come to marietta come rather like the man and woman of the|massachusetts|bay|company to boston an organized society unafraid to meet temporary adventure but serious in seek permanent security for man and woman and child and home many of be destine to push on but most come intend to stay such people may not be the first to conquer the earth but will always be the last to possess right behind the man and woman who establish marietta and move that instrument of law and order and cooperation government a representative of the national government enter marietta to administer the|northwest|territory under the famous northwest|ordinance and what be celebrate today be this establishment of the first civil government west of the original state provision of the northwest ordinance always like to remember provide that no person demean in a peaceable and orderly manner shall ever be molest on account of mode of worship or for religious sentiment in the said territory provide that religion morality and knowledge be necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind school and mean of education shall forever be encourage and provide for the perpetual prohibition of slavery in the territory free educate god fear man and woman that be what the state hope the new west would exemplify have well fulfil that hope every generation meet substantially the same problem under own different set of circumstance anyone speculate on great migration westward be strike with the human parallel between the drive force behind that migration and the drive force behind the great social exploration be carry on today most of the people who go out to ohio in and who follow wave on wave for another|hundred|year go to improve economic lot in other word be follow the same yearning for security which be drive forward today at the end of the wagon rut there be something worth the physical risk the standard of life in a log cabin amid field still blacken with half burn stump be not high but be certain a family or at most a township could be a whole self suffice economic system plenty of food to eat if a man would but reach out and shoot or cultivate plenty of warm clothe if the woman of the family be willing to spin always a tight roof over the family 's head if the little community would respond to the call for a roof raising whatever use be a man 's own have the solid joy of possession of own home and mean of livelihood and if thing do not pan out there be always an infinite self sufficiency beckoning further westward — to new land new game new opportunity under such condition there be so much to get do which man could not get do alone that the frontiersman naturally reach out to government as great single instrument of cooperative self help with the aid of which could get thing do to the use of government be but another form of the cooperation of good neighbor government be an indispensable instrument of daily life of the security of woman and child and home and opportunity look on government not as a thing apart as a power over people regard as a power of the people as a democratic expression of organized self help like a frontier husk bee there be worried legalist back in the seaboard town who be sure be unconstitutional for the|federal|government to help to put road and railroad and canal through these new territory who be sure that the nation would never get back the money be plow into development of the natural and human resource of the northwest but abraham|lincoln who incarnate the spirit of the people who be actually live in the|northwest|territory sum up attitude when say the legitimate object of government be to do for a community of people whatever need to have do but can not do at all or can not do so well for in separate and individual capacity today under new condition a whole nation the critical state and all the west and south that have grow out of be on a mental migration dissatisfy with old condition seek like the little band that come to marietta to create new condition of security and again the people see an ally in own government many a man do not own cabin any more possession be a bank deposit scarcely any man can call neighbor to raise roof any more pay a contractor cash and have to have mortgage financing to find the cash and if that financing be of the wrong kind or go bad may need help to save home from foreclosure once old age be safe because there be always something useful which man and woman no matter how old could do to earn an honorable maintenance that time be go and some new kind of organized old age insurance have to be provide in these perplexity the individual turn as have always turn to the collective security of the willingness of fellow to cooperate through the use of government to help and each other the spirit of the frontier husk bee be find today in carefully draft statute statute insure bank deposit statute provide mortgage money for home through f.h.a. statute provide help through h.o.l.c. for those in danger of foreclosure the cavalry captain who protect the log cabin of the northwest be now supplant by legislator like senator bulkley toil over the drafting of such statute and over the efficiency of government machinery to administer so that such protection and help of government can be extend to the full on a|thousand front government state and municipal as well as federal be play the same role of the insurer of security for the average man woman and child that the army detachment play in of the old northwest|territory when think through at the bottom most of the great protective statute of today be in essence mutual insurance company and recent legislation be not a departure from but a return to the healthy practice of mutual self help of the early settler of the northwest let not be afraid to help each other let never forget that government be and not an alien power over the

armament in other nation and an international situation which be definitely disturbing to all of the congress have authorize important addition to the national armed defense of shore and people on another other important subject the net result of a struggle in the congress have be an important victory for the people of the|united|state what may well be call a lost battle which win a war will remember that a|year|and|a|half|ago nearly on february|5,|1937 send a message to the congress deal with the real need of reform of several kind in way or another during the session of this congress the end speak of the real objective seek in the that message have be substantially attain the attitude of the|supreme|court towards constitutional question be entirely change recent decision be eloquent testimony of a willingness to collaborate with the other branch of government to make democracy work the government have be grant the right to protect interest in litigation between private party involve the constitutionality of federal statute when the constitutionality of federal statute be involve and to appeal directly to the|supreme|court in all case involve the constitutionality of federal statute and no single judge be any longer empower to suspend a federal statute on sole judgment as to constitutionality a of the|supreme|court may now retire at ten|year of service and a substantial number of additional judgeship have be create in order to expedite the trial of case and finally great flexibility have be add to the federal judicial system by allow judge to be assign to congested district another indirect accomplishment of this congress have be think response to the devotion of the american people to a course of sane and consistent liberalism the congress have understand that under modern condition government have a continue responsibility to meet continue problem and that government can not take a|holiday|of|a|year or a|month or even a day just because a few people be tired or frighten by the inescapable pace fast pace of this modern world in which live some of opponent and some of associate have consider that have a mistakenly sentimental judgment as to the tenacity of purpose and the general level of intelligence of the american people be still convinced that the american people since continue to insist on requisite of private enterprise and the relationship of government to the first be a complete honesty a complete honesty at the top in look after the use of other people 's money and in apportion and pay individual and corporate taxis accord to in accordance with ability to pay and the second be sincere respect for the need of all people who be at the bottom all people at the bottom who need to get work and through work to get a really fair share of the good thing of life and a chance to save and a chance to rise after the election of be tell and the congress be tell by an increase number of politically and worldly-- wise people that should coast along enjoy an easy presidency for four|years and not take the democratic platform too seriously tell that people be get weary of reform through political effort and would no longer oppose that small minority which in spite of own disastrous leadership in be always eager to resume control over the government of the|united|state never in lifetime have such a concert campaign of defeatism be throw at the head of the president and the senators and congressmen as in the case of this|seventy fifth|congress never before have have so many copperhead among and will remember that be the copperheads who in the|day of the|civil|war the|war between the states try good to make president lincoln and congress give up the fight in the middle of the fight to let the nation remain split in and return to peace yes peace at any price this congress have end on the side of the people faith in the american people and faith in have be justify congratulate the congress and the leadership thereof and congratulate the american people on own staying power word about economic situation make no difference to whether call a recession or a depression in the total national income of all the people in the country have reach the low point of eight|billion|dollar in that|year with each succeed year rise last|year,|1937 have rise to seventy|billion|dollars despite definitely bad business and agricultural price in the|last|four|months|of|last|year while be too early to do more than give an a mere estimate hope that the national income will not fall below sixty|billion|dollar and that be a lot well than thirty- eight|billion|dollar remember also that banking and business and farming be not fall apart like the hoss shay as do in the terrible winter of to last|year mistake be make by the leader of private enterprise by the leader of labor and by the leader of government last|year the leader of private enterprise plead for a sudden curtailment of public spending and say would take up the slack but make the mistake of increase inventory too fast and set many of price too high for good to sell some labor leader goad by decade of oppression of labor make the mistake of go too far be not wise in use method which frighten many well wish people ask employer not only to bargain with but to put up with jurisdictional dispute at the same time government too make mistake mistake of optimism in assume that industry and labor would make no mistake and government make a mistake of timing in not pass a farm bill or a wage and hour bill last|year as a result of the lesson of all these mistake hope that in the future private enterprise capital and labor alike will operate more intelligently together and operate in great cooperation with own government than have in the past such cooperation on the part of both of will be very welcome to certainly at this stage there should be a united stand on the part of both of to resist wage cut which would further reduce purchase power this|afternoon only|a|few|hours|ago be tell that a great steel company announce a reduction in price with a view to stimulate business recovery and be tell and be gratify to know that this reduction in price have involve no wage cut every encouragement ought to be give to industry which accept the large volume and high wage policy if this be do throughout the nation ought to result in condition which will replace a great part of the government spending which the failure of cooperation have make necessary this|year will remember that from march|4,|1933 down to date not a|single|week have pass without a cry from the opposition a small opposition a cry to do something to say something to restore confidence there be a very articulate group of people in this country with plenty of ability to procure publicity for view who have consistently refuse to cooperate with the mass of the people whether thing be go well or go badly on the ground that require more concession to point of view before would admit have what call confidence these people demand restoration of confidence when the bank be close and demand again when the bank be reopen demand restoration of confidence when hungry people be throng the street and demand again now when the hungry people be feed and put to work demand restoration of confidence when drought hit the country and demand again now when field be laden with bounteous yield and excessive crop demand restoration of confidence last|year when the automobile industry be run shift day and night turn out more car than the country could buy and be demand again this|year when the industry be try to get rid of an automobile surplus and have shut down factory as a result but friend be belief that many of these people who have be cry aloud for confidence be begin today to realize that that hand have be overplay and that be now willing to talk cooperation instead be belief that the mass of the american people do have confidence in have confidence in ability with the aid of government to solve own problem be because be not satisfied and be not satisfied with the progress that have make in finally solve business and agricultural and social problem that believe the great majority of want own government to keep on try to solve in simple frankness and in simple honesty need all the help can get and see sign of get more help in the future from many who have fight against progress with tooth and nail in the past and now follow out this line of thought want to say a few word about the come political primary fifty|years|ago party nomination be generally make in convention a system typify in the public imagination by a little group in a smoke fill room who make out the party slate the direct primary be invent to make the nominating process a more democratic to give the party voter a chance to pick party candidate what be go to say to tonight do not relate to the primary of any particular political party but to matter of principle in all party democratic republican farmer labor progressive socialist or any other let that be clearly understand be hope that everybody affiliate with any party will vote in the primary and that every such voter will consider the fundamental principle for which or party be on record that make for a healthy choice between the candidate of the oppose party on election|day in november an election can not give the country a firm sense of direction if have or more national party which merely have different name but be as alike in principle and aim as pea in the same pod in the come primary in all party there will be many clash between school of thought generally classify as liberal and conservative roughly speak the liberal school of thought recognize that the new condition throughout the world call for new remedy those of in america who hold to this school of thought insist that these new remedy can be adopt and successfully maintain in this country under present form of government if use government as an instrument of cooperation to provide these remedy believe that can solve problem through continue effort through democratic process instead of fascism or communism be oppose to the kind of moratorium on reform which in effect be mean reaction be clearly understand however that when use the word liberal mean the believer in progressive principle of democratic representative government and not the wild man who in effect lean in the direction of communism for that be just as dangerous to as fascism the opposing or conservative school of thought as a general proposition do not recognize the need for government to step in and take action to meet these new problem believe that individual initiative and private philanthropy will solve that ought to repeal many of the thing have do and go back for instance example to the old gold standard or stop all this business of old age pension and unemployment insurance or repeal the securities and exchange act or let monopoly thrive unchecked in effect to the kind of government that have in the|nineteen|twenties assume the mental capacity of all the candidate the important question which seem to the primary voter must ask be this to which of these general school of thought do the candidate belong as president of the|united|state be not ask the voter of the country to vote for democrats next|november as oppose to republicans or member of any other party nor be as president take part in democratic primary as the head of however charge with the responsibility of carry out the definitely liberal declaration of principle set forth in the democratic platform feel that have every right to speak in those few instance where there may be a clear cut issue between candidate for a democratic nomination involve these principle or involve a clear misuse of own name do not misunderstand certainly would not indicate a preference in a state primary merely because a candidate otherwise liberal in outlook have conscientiously differ with on any single issue should be far more concerned about the general attitude of a candidate towards present day problem and own inward desire to get practical need attend to in a practical way and all know that progress may be block by outspoken reactionary and also but also know that progress can be block by those who say yes to a progressive objective but who always find some reason to oppose any special specific proposal to gain that objective call that type of candidate a yes but fellow and be concerned about the attitude of a candidate or sponsor with respect to the right of american citizen to assemble peaceably and to express publicly view and opinion on important social and economic issue there can be no constitutional democracy in any community which deny to the individual freedom to speak and worship as wish the american people will not be deceive by anyone who attempt to suppress individual liberty under the pretense of patriotism this be a free country with freedom of expression with freedom of the press as be entirely proper there will be a lot of mean blow strike between now and election|day by blow mean misrepresentation and personal attack and appeal to prejudice would be a lot well of course if campaign everywhere could be wag with argument instead of with blow hope the liberal candidate will confine to argument and not resort to blow for in case out of the speaker or the writer who seek to influence public opinion descend from calm argument to unfair blow hurt more than opponent the chinese have a story on this a story base on three|or|four|thousand|year of civilization chinese cooly be argue heatedly in the midst middle of a crowd in the street a stranger express surprise that no blow be be strike by chinese friend reply the man who strike first admit that idea have give out know that neither in the summer primary nor in the november election will the american voter fail to spot the candidate whose idea have give out view transcript transcript five|month have go by since last speak to the people of the nation about the state of the nation have hope to be able to defer this talk until next|week because as all know this be holy|week but what want to say to the people of the country be of such immediate need and relate so closely to the life of human being and the prevention of human suffering that have feel that there should be no delay in this decision have be strengthen by the thought that by speak tonight there may be great peace of mind and that the hope of easter may be more real at fireside everywhere and therefore that be not inappropriate to encourage peace when so many of be think of the|prince|of|peace five|years|ago face a very serious problem of economic and social recovery for four|and|a|half|year that recovery proceed apace be only in the|past|seven|months that have receive a visible setback and be only within the|past|two|month as have wait patiently to see whether the force of business would counteract that have become apparent that government can no longer safely fail to take aggressive government step to meet this recession have not return to to the disaster and suffering of the|beginning|of|1933 money in the bank be safe farmer be no longer in deep distress and have great purchasing power danger of security speculation have be minimize national income be almost|50 % high than be in and government have an establish and accept responsibility for relief but know that many of have lose job or have see friend or member of family lose job and do not propose that the government shall pretend not to see these thing know that the effect of present difficulty have be uneven that have affect some group and some locality seriously but that have be scarcely feel in other but conceive the first duty of government be to protect the economic welfare of all the people in all section and in all group say in message open the last session of the congress that if private enterprise do not provide job this|spring government would take up the slack that would not let the people down have all learn the lesson that government can not afford to wait until have lose the power to act therefore friend have send a message of far reach importance to the congress want to read to tonight certain passage from that message and to talk with about in that message analyze the cause of the collapse of in these word over speculation in and over production of practically every article or instrument use by man million of people to be sure have be put to work but the product of hand have exceed the purchasing power of pocketbook under the inexorable law of supply and demand supply so overran demand which would pay)that production be compel to stop unemployment and closed factory result hence today point out to the congress that the national income not the government 's income but the total of the income of all the individual citizen and family of the|united|state every farmer every worker every banker every professional man and every person who live on income derive from investment that national income have amount in the|year|1929 to one|billion|dollars by this have fall to eight|billion|dollar gradually and up to a|few|months|ago have rise to a total an annual total of eight|billion|dollar a pretty good come- back from the low point then say this to the congress but the very vigor of the recovery in both durable good and consumer ' good bring into the picture early in a|year|ago certain highly undesirable practice which be in large part responsible for the economic decline which begin in the|later|months|of|that|year again production have outran outrun the ability to buy there be many reason for this over production of be fear fear of war abroad fear of inflation fear of nation wide strike none of these fear have be bear out production in many important line of good outrun the ability of the public to purchase as have say for example through the winter and spring of cotton factory in hundred of case be run on a shift basis pile up cotton good in the factory and good in the hand of middle man and retailer for example also automobile manufacturer not only turn out a normal increase of finished car but encourage the normal increase to run into abnormal figure use every know method to push sale this mean of course that the steel mill of the nation run on a basis and the tire company and cotton factory and glass factory and other speed up to meet the same type of abnormally stimulate demand yes the buying power of the nation lag behind thus by the|autumn|of|1937 last|autumn the nation again have stock on hand which the consume public could not buy because the purchasing power of the consume public have not keep pace with the production during the same period the price of many vital product have rise faster than be warrant for example copper which undoubtedly can be produce at a profit in this country for from ten|to|twelve|cents a pound be push up and up to seventeen|cent a pound the price of steel product of many kind be increase far more than be justify by the increase wage of steel worker in the case of many commodity the price to the consumer be raise well above the inflationary boom price of in many line of good and material price get so high in the|summer|of|1937 that buyer and builder cease to buy or to build the economic process of get out the raw material put through the manufacturing and finishing process sell to the retailer sell to the consumer and finally use get completely out of balance the lay off of worker come upon last|autumn and have be continue at such a pace ever since that all of government and banking and business and worker and those face with destitution recognize the need for action all of this say to the congress today and repeat to the people of the country tonight go on to point out to the senate and the|house|of|representative that all the energy of government and business must be direct to increase the national income to put more people into private job to give security and a feeling of security to all people in all walk of life be constantly think of all people unemployed and employ alike of human problem human problem of food and clothing and home and education and health and old age and agree that security be great need the chance to work the opportunity of make a reasonable profit in business whether be a very small business or a large the possibility of sell farm product for enough money for family to live on decently know these be the thing that decide the well being of all people therefore be determined to do all in power to help attain that security and because know that the people have a deep conviction that secure prosperity of that kind can not be a lasting one except on a basis of business fair business deal and a basis where all from the top to the bottom share in the prosperity repeat to the congress today that neither nor the chief executive can afford to weaken or destroy great reform which during have be effect on behalf of the american people in rehabilitation of the banking structure and of agriculture in provision for adequate and cheap credit for all type of business in acceptance of national responsibility for unemployment relief in strengthening of the credit of state and local government in encouragement of housing and slum clearance and home ownership in supervision of stock exchange and public utility hold company and the issuance of new security in provision for social security the electorate of america want no backward step take have recognize the right of labor to free organization to collective bargaining and machinery for the handling of labor relation be now in existence the principle be establish even though can all admit that through the evolution of time administration and practice can be improve such improvement can come about most quickly and most peacefully through sincere effort to understand and assist on the part of labor leader and employer alike the never cease evolution of human society will doubtless bring forth new problem which will require new adjustment immediate task be to consolidate and maintain the gain have achieve in this situation there be no reason and no occasion for any american to allow fear to be arouse or energy and enterprise to be paralyze by doubt or uncertainty come to the conclusion that the present day problem call for action both by the government and by the people that suffer primarily from a failure of consumer demand because of lack of buying power therefore be up to to create an economic upturn how and where can and should the government help to start an upward spiral economic upturn go on in message today to propose group of measure and will summarize recommendation first ask for certain appropriation which be intend to keep the government expenditure for work relief and similar purpose during that begin on the|first|of|july keep that go at the same rate of expenditure as at present that include additional money for the|works|progress|administration additional fund for the|farm|security|administration additional allotment for the|national|youth|administration and more money for the|civilian|conservation|corps in order that can maintain the exist number of camp now in operation these appropriation make necessary by increase unemployment will cost about|a|billion and a quarter dollar more than the estimate which send to the congress on the third of january last second tell the congress that the administration propose to make additional bank reserve available for the credit need of the country about|one|billion|four|hundred|million|dollar of gold now in the treasury will be use to pay these additional expense of the government and quarter of a dollar of additional credit will be make available to the bank by reduce the reserve now require by the|federal|reserve|board these step take care of relief need and add to bank credit be in good judgment insufficient by to start the nation on a sustained upward movement therefore come to the third kind of government action which consider to be vital say to the congress and can not afford to equip with round of ammunition where round be necessary if stop at relief and credit may find without ammunition before the enemy be route if be fully equip with the third round of ammunition stand to win the battle against adversity this third proposal be to make definite addition to the purchasing power of the nation by provide new work over and above the continuing of the old work first to enable the|united|states|housing|authority to undertake the immediate construction of about|three|hundred|million|dollar worth of additional slum clearance project second to renew a public work program by start as quickly as possible about|one|billion|dollars worth of need permanent public improvement in state and county and city third to add to the estimate for federal aid highway in excess of the amount that recommend in january fourth to add seven|million|dollar over and above the former estimate of three|million for flood control and reclamation fifth to add five|million|dollars additional for federal building in various part of the country in recommend this program be think not only of the immediate economic need of the people of the nation but also of personal liberty most precious possession of all americans be think of democracy be think of the recent trend in other part of the world away from the democratic ideal democracy have disappear in several other great nation disappear not because the people of those nation dislike democracy but because have grow tired of unemployment and insecurity of see child hungry while sit helpless in the face of government confusion government weakness weakness through lack of leadership in government finally in desperation choose to sacrifice liberty in the hope of get something to eat in america know that own democratic institution can be preserve and make to work but in order to preserve need to act together to meet the problem of the nation boldly and to prove that the practical operation of democratic government be equal to the task of protect the security of the people not only future economic soundness but the very soundness of democratic institution depend on the determination of government to give employment to idle man the people of america be in agreement in defend liberty at any cost and the first line of that defense lie in the protection of economic security government seek to protect democracy must prove that government be strong than the force of business depression history prove that dictatorship do not grow out of strong and successful government but out of weak and helpless government if by democratic method people get a government strong enough to protect from fear and starvation democracy succeed but if do not grow impatient therefore the only sure bulwark of continue liberty be a government strong enough to protect the interest of the people and a people strong enough and well enough inform to maintain sovereign control over government be a rich nation can afford to pay for security and prosperity without have to sacrifice liberty into the bargain in the|first|century of republic be short of capital short of worker and short of industrial production but be rich very rich in free land and free timber and free mineral wealth the|federal|government of those day rightly assume the duty of promote business and relieve depression by give subsidy of land and other resource thus from our|earliest|days have have a tradition of substantial government help to system of private enterprise but today the government no longer have vast tract of rich land to give away and have discover too that must spend large sum of money to conserve land from further erosion and forest from further depletion the situation be also very different from the|old|day because now have plenty of capital bank and insurance company load with idle money plenty of industrial productive capacity and many million of worker look for job be follow tradition as well as necessity if government strive to put idle money and idle man to work to increase public wealth and to build up the health and strength of the people help system of private enterprise to function again be go to cost something to get out of this recession this way but the profit of get out of will pay for the cost several time over lose work time be lose money every|day that a workman be unemployed or a machine be unused or a business organization be mark time be a loss to the nation because of idle man and idle machine this nation lose between|1929|and|the|spring|of|1933 in less|than|four|year this|year the people of this country be make about|twelve|billion|dollar less than be last|year if think back to the experience of the|early|years of this administration will remember the doubt and fear express about the rise expense of government but to the surprise of the doubter as proceed to carry on the program which include public|works and work relief the country grow rich instead of poor be worthwhile to remember that the annual national people 's income be thirty|billion|dollars more last|year in than be in be true that the national debt increase sixteen|billion|dollars but remember that in that increase must be include several|billion|dollars worth of asset which eventually will reduce that debt and that many|billion|dollar of permanent public improvement school road bridge tunnel public building park and a host of other thing meet eye in every of the one|hundre county in the|united|state no doubt will be tell that the government spending program of do not cause the increase in national income will tell that business revive because of private spending and investment that be true in part for the government spend only a small part of the total but that government spending act as a trigger a trigger to set off private activity that be why the total addition to national production and national income have be so much great than the contribution of the government in pursuance of that think say to the congress today want to make clear that do not believe that can get an adequate rise in national income merely by invest and lending or spend public fund be essential in economy that private fund must be put to work and all of recognize that such fund be entitle to a fair profit as national income rise let not forget that government expenditure will go down and government tax receipt will go up the government contribution of land that once make to business be the land of all the people and the government contribution of money which now make to business ultimately come out of the labor of all the people be therefore only sound morality as well as a sound distribution of buy power that the benefit of the prosperity come from this use of the money of all the people ought to be distribute among all the people the people at the bottom as well as the people at the top consequently be again express hope that the congress will enact at this session a wage and hour bill put a floor under industrial wage and a limit on working|hours to ensure a well distribution of prosperity a well distribution of available work and a sounder distribution of buying power may get all kind of impression in regard to the total cost of this new program or in regard to the amount that will be add to the net national debt be a big program last|autumn in a sincere effort to bring government expenditure and government income into close balance the budget work out call for sharp crease in government spending during the|coming|year but in the light of present condition condition of today those estimate turn out to have be far too low this new program add two|billion and dollar to direct treasury expenditure and another nine|hundred|and|fifty|million dollar to government loan the latter sum because be loan will come back to the treasury in the future the net effect on the debt of the government be this fifteen|month away the treasury will have to raise less|than|a|billion|and|a|half|dollar of new money such an addition to the net debt of the|united|state nee not give concern to any citizen for will return to the people of many time over in increase buying power and eventually in much great government tax receipt because of the increase in the citizen income what say to the congress today in the close of message repeat to now let unanimously recognize the fact that the federal debt whether be five|billions|or billion can only be pay if the nation obtain a vastly increase citizen income repeat that if this citizen income can be raise to eighty|billion|dollar a year the national government and the overwhelming majority of state and local government will be definitely out of the red the high the national income go the faster will be able to reduce the total of federal and state and local debt view from every angle today 's purchasing power citizen ' income of today be not at this time sufficient to drive the economic system of america at high speed responsibility of government require at this time to supplement the normal process and in so supplement to make sure that the addition be adequate must start again on a long steady upward incline in national income and in that process which believe be ready to start let avoid the pitfall of the past the overproduction the over speculation and indeed all the extreme which do not succeed in avoid in in all of this government can not and should not act alone business must help and be sure business will help need more than the material of recovery need a united national will need to recognize nationally that the demand of no group however just can be satisfied unless that group be prepared to share in find a way to produce the income from which and all other group can be pay as the congress as the president must by virtue of office seek the national good by preserve the balance between all group and all section have at disposal the national resource the money the skill of hand and head to raise economic level citizen ' income capacity be limit only by ability to work together what be need be the will the time have come to bring that will into action with every driving force at command and be determined to do share certain positive requirement seem to to accompany the will if have that will there be place on all of the duty of self restraint that be the discipline of a democracy every patriotic citizen must say to or that immoderate statement appeal to prejudice the creation of unkindness be offense not against an individual or individual but offense against the whole population of the|united|state use of power by any group however situate to force interest or to use strategic position in order to receive more from the common fund than contribution to the common fund justifie be an attack against and not an aid to national life self restraint imply restraint by articulate public opinion train to distinguish fact from falsehood train to believe that bitterness be never a useful instrument in public affair there can be no dictatorship by an individual or by a group in this nation save through division foster by hate such division there must never be and finally should like to say a personal word to never forget that live in a house own by all the american people and that have be give trust try always to remember that deep problem be human constantly talk with those who come to tell own point of view with those who manage the great industry and financial institution of the country those who represent the farmer and the worker and often very often with average citizen without high position who come to this house and constantly seek to look beyond the door of the|white|house beyond the officialdom of the|national|capital into the hope and fear of man and woman in home have travel the country over many time friend enemy daily mail bring to report of what be think and hope want to be sure that neither battle nor burden of office shall ever blind to an intimate knowledge of the way the american people want to live and the simple purpose for which put here

reconcile difference can not satisfy everyone completely because do not expect too much be not disappointed but know that must never give up that must never let the great interest of all the people down merely because that may be for the moment the easy personal way out believe that have be right in the course have chart to abandon purpose of build a great a more stable and a more tolerant america would be to miss the tide and perhaps to miss the port propose to sail ahead feel sure that hope and feel sure that help be with for to reach a port must sail sail not lie at anchor sail not drift view transcript transcript be appeal to the people of america tonight to help in carry out a task that be important to and to government be a part but an essential part of the great task of find job for willing worker who be idle through no fault of own of find more work for those who be insufficiently employ and of survey the need of worker and industry to see if can find the basis of a well long range plan of re - employment than have now enforce idleness embrace any considerable portion of people in a nation of such wealth and natural opportunity be a paradox that challenge ingenuity unemployment be of the bitter and galling problem that now afflict man kind have be with in a measure since the beginning of industrial era have be increase by the complexity of business and industry and have be make more acute by the depression have make necessary the expenditure of billions|of|dollar for relief and for publicly create work have delay the balancing of national budget and increase the tax burden of all people in addition to the problem face by the national government state and local government have be sorely press to meet the increase load result from unemployment be a problem of every civilized nation not alone have be solve in some country by start huge armament program but americans do not want to solve that way nevertheless as a nation adopt the policy that no unemployed man or woman can be permit to starve for lack of aid that be still policy but the situation call for a permanent cure and not just a temporary unemployment relief be of course not the permanent cure the permanent cure lie in find suitable job in industry and agriculture for all willing worker involve cooperative effort and planning which will lead to the absorption of this unused man power in private industry such planning call for fact which do not now possess such planning apply not only to worker but to the employer in industry because involve try to get rid of what call the peak and valley of employment and unemployment try with the help of industry to plan against produce more|goods|one|year than people can or will consume and cut production drastically the|following|year with the result lay off of hundreds|of|thousands of worker that be a long and difficult problem to find the answer to and may take many effort in the|coming|years to find the right answer but in the meantime need more fact for several|year vary estimate of the extent of unemployment have be make valuable as some of these estimate have be in provide an approximation of the extent of unemployment have not provide with sufficient factual datum on which to base a comprehensive re - employment program during this|coming|week be go to strive to get such fact be go to conduct a nation wide census of the unemployed and the partly unemployed and be go to conduct in the genuinely democratic american way this be to be a wholly voluntary census be go to hold the mirror up to and try to get not only a true and honest reflection of present unemployment condition but fact which will help to plan constructively for the future only in a nation whose people be alert to own self interest and alive to responsibility of citizenship could such a voluntary plan succeed be confident that this great american undertaking will succeed every effort be be put forth to make all of people understand and appreciate significance and be sure will all give helpful aid as have in previous effort aim at national improvement and through which people have show capacity for self government on tuesday next november the|post|office|department through far flung and highly efficient organization will undertake to deliver to every abode in the|united|state an unemployment report card contain simple question the|report|card which the postman will leave at door on tuesday be a double post - card large than the customary card be address especially to those who be unemployed or partly unemployed and who be able to work and be seek work this card contain a message to from carry the assurance that if will give all the fact will help in plan for the benefit of those who need and want work and do not now have this message call upon the unemployed and everyone else in this land to help make this census complete honest and accurate if all unemployed and partly unemployed person who be able to work and who be seek work will conscientiously fill out these card and mail just as be without stamp or envelope by or before midnight november|20 nation will have real fact upon which to base a sound re - employment program be important for every unemployed person to understand that this report card be not an application for relief nor registration for a job this be purely and simply a fact seek census when receive this card will note that the question be design to give this nation a wide basis of knowledge of unemployment condition than have heretofore have if unemployed and partly unemployed wholeheartedly give the information seek in these question will know not only the extent of unemployment and partial unemployment but will know the geographical location of unemployment by state and community will likewise be able to tell what age group be most severely affected but most important of all will know the work qualification of the unemployed will know in what industry be suit to function and will be equip to determine what future industrial trend be most likely to absorb these idle worker think be necessary to emphasize that only those unemployed or partly unemployed who be able to work and who be seek work should fill out these card all other may disregard but appeal to all of who be employ today to enlist as good neighbor to those who be unemployed in community and who may need help in fill out card properly and promptly may need the stimulus of cooperation to recognize the importance of this national effort to help think this neighborly cooperation will be very helpful in dispel from the mind of the unemployed all fear that the information seek in this census be to be use for any purpose other than helpfulness repeat the assurance to the unemployed that the information which give on these report card will in no sense be use against but so far as lie within power will be employ for own good and for the welfare of the nation when have ascertain the full fact of unemployment can extend the voluntary and neighborly character of this effort to the task of find the solution to the perplex problem importance justify a national approach free from prejudice or partisanship and warrant the cooperative endeavor of business of labor of agriculture and of government be confident that this nation of our have the genius to reorder affair and possess the physical resource to make possible for everyone young or old to enjoy the opportunity to work and earn there be neither logic nor necessity for third of population to have less of the need of modern life than make for decent living national purchasing power be the soil from which come all prosperity the steady flow of wage to million of worker be essential if the product of industry and of farmer be to be consume far sight industrial leader now recognize that a very substantial share of corporate earning must be pay out in wage or the soil from which these industry grow will soon become impoverished farmer recognize that large customer be the worker for wage and that farm market can not be maintain except through widespread purchasing power this unemployment problem be therefore in which every individual and every economic group have a direct interest be a problem whose discussion must be remove from the field of prejudice to the field of logic shall find the solution only when have the fact and have the fact accept mutual responsibility the inherent right to work be of the elemental privilege of a free people continued failure to achieve that right and privilege by anyone who want to work and need work be a challenge to civilization and to security endow as nation be with abundant physical resource and inspire as should be with the high purpose to make those resource and opportunity available for the enjoyment of all approach this problem of reemployment with the real hope of find a well answer than have now the|unemployment|census as a sensible first step to a constructive re - employment program ought to be a successful bit of national team work from which will come again that feeling of national solidarity which be the strength and the glory of the american people transcript this|afternoon have issue a proclamation call a special session of the congress to convene on monday,|november|15,|1937 do this in order to give to the congress an opportunity to consider important legislation before the regular session in january and to enable the congress to avoid a lengthy session next|year extend through the|summer know that many enemy of democracy will say that be bad for business bad for the tranquility of the country to have a special session even begin only|six|week before the regular session but have never have sympathy with the point of view that a session of the congress be an unfortunate intrusion of what call politic into national affair those who do not like democracy want to keep legislator at home but the congress be an essential instrument of democratic government and democratic government can never be consider an intruder into the affair of a democratic nation shall ask this special session to consider immediately certain important legislation which recent trip through the nation convince the american people immediately need this do not mean that other legislation to which be not refer tonight be not an important for part of national well being but other legislation can be more readily discuss at the regular session anyone charge with propose or judge national policy should have first hand knowledge of the nation as a whole that be why again this|year have take trip to all part of the country last|spring visit the southwest this|summer make several trip in the east now be just back from a trip from a trip all the way across the continent and later this autumn hope to pay annual visit to the southeast for a president especially be a duty to think in national term must think not only of this|year but of future|year when someone else will be president must look beyond the average of the prosperity and well being of the country for because average easily cover up danger spot of poverty and instability must not let the country be deceive by a merely temporary prosperity which depend on wasteful exploitation of resource which can not last must think not only of keep out of war today but also of keep out of war in generation to come the kind of prosperity want be the sound and permanent kind which be not build up temporarily at the expense of any a section or any group and the kind of peace want be the sound and permanent kind which be build on the cooperative search for peace by all the nation which want peace the other day be ask to state outstanding impression gain on this recent trip to the|pacific|coast and back and say that seem to to be the general understanding on the part of the average citizen understanding of the broad objective and policy which have just outline five|year of fierce discussion and debate five|year of information through the radio and the move picture have take the whole nation to school in the nation 's business even those who have most attack objective have by very criticism encourage the mass of citizen to think about and understand the issue involve and understanding to approve out of that process have learn to think as a nation and out of that process have learn to feel a nation as never before in history each section of america say to every other section thy people shall be people for most of the country this have be better in dollar and cent than for many|year far better in the soundness of prosperity and everywhere go find particular optimism about the good effect on business which be expect from the steady spending by farmer of the large farm income in many|years but have not yet do all that must be do to make this prosperity stable the people of the|united|state be check in effort to prevent future pile up of huge agricultural surplus and the tumble price which inevitably follow be check in effort to secure reasonable minimum wage and maximum hour and the end of child labor and because be check many group in many part of the country still have less purchase power and a low standard of living than the nation as a whole can permanently allow american realize these fact that be why ask government not to stop overne simply because prosperity have come back a long way do not look on government as an interloper in affair on the contrary regard as the most effective form of organized self help sometimes get bored sit in washington hear certain people talk and talk about all that government ought not to do people who get all want from government back in the|day when the financial institution and the railroad be be bail out in bail out by the government be refresh to go out through the country and feel the common wisdom that the time to repair the roof be when the sun be shin want the financial budget balance but want the human budget balance as well want to set up a national economy which balance with as little government subsidy as possible for realize that persistent subsidy ultimately bankrupt government be less concerned that every detail be immediately right than be that the direction be right know that just so long as be travel on the right road do not make much difference if occasionally hit a thank marm the overwhelming majority of citizen who live by agriculture be think very clearly how want government to help in connection with the production of crop want government help in way first in the control of surplus and second in the proper use of land the|other|day a reporter tell that have never be able to understand why the government seek to curtail crop production and at the same time to open up new irrigated acre be confuse totally separate objective crop surplus control relate to the total amount of any major crop grow in the whole nation on all cultivate land good or bad good land or poor land control by the cooperation of the crop grower and with the help of the government land use on the other hand be a policy of provide each farmer with the good quality and type of land have or can make available for part in that total production add good new land for diversify crop be offset by abandon poor land now uneconomically farm the total amount of production largely determine the price of the crop and therefore the difference between comfort and misery for the farmer let give an example if americans be foolish enough to run every shoe factory four|hour a day seven|days a week would soon have more shoe than the nation could possibly buy a surplus of shoe so great that would have to be destroy or give away or sell at price far below the cost of production that simple law illustration that simple law of supply and demand equally affect the price of all major crop and have hear big manufacturer talk about control of production by the farmer as an indefensible economy of scarcity as call and yet these same manufacturer never hesitate to shut down own huge plant throw man out of work and cut down the purchasing power of the whole community community whenever think that must adjust production to an oversupply of the good make when be baby who have the measle call not an economy of scarcity but sound business judgment of course speak seriously what and want be such governmental rule of the game that labor and agriculture and industry will all produce a balanced abundance without waste so intend this|winter to find a way to prevent and a half cent cotton and nine|cent corn and thirty|cent wheat with all the disaster those price mean for all of to prevent those price from ever come back again to do that the farmer want to cooperate to build an all weather farm program so that in the long run price will be more stable believe this can be do and the national budget keep out of the red and when have find that way to protect the farmer ' price from the effect of alternate crop surplus and crop scarcity shall also have find the way to protect the nation 's food supply from the effect of the same fluctuation ought always to have enough food at price within the reach of the consume public for the consumer in the city of america must find a way to help the farmer to store up in year of plenty enough to avoid hardship in the|year of scarcity land use policy be a different thing have just visit much of the work that the|national|government be do to stop soil erosion to save forest to prevent flood to produce electric power for more general use and to give people a chance to move from poor land on to well land by irrigate thousands|of|acre that need only water to provide an opportunity to make a good living see bare and burn hillside where only|a|few|years|ago great forest be grow be now be plant to young tree not only to stop erosion but to provide a lumber supply for the future see ccc boy and wpa worker build check dam and small pond and terrace to raise the water table and make possible for farm and village to remain in safety where now be see the harnessing of the turbulent missouri a muddy stream with the topsoil of many state and see barge on new channel carry produce and freight athwart the nation let give simple illustration of why government project of this type have a national importance for the whole country and not merely a local importance in the|boise|valley in idaho see a district which have be recently irrigate to enormous fertility so that a family can now make a pretty good living from forty|acre of land many of the family who be make good in that valley today move there from a|thousand|miles away come from the dust strip that run through the middle of the nation all the way from the canadian border to mexico texas a strip which include large portion of state that valley in western idaho therefore assume at once a national importance as a second chance for willing farmer and year by year propose to add more valley to take care of thousand of other family who need the same kind of second chance in new green pasture the other illustration be at in the|state|of|washington the engineer in charge tell that almost|half of the whole cost of that dam to date have be spend for material that be manufacture east of the|mississippi|river give employment and wages|to|thousand of industrial worker in the eastern third of the nation two|thousand|miles away all of this work need of course a more business like system of planning and a great foresight than use today and that be why recommend to the last session of the congress the creation of planning region in which local people will originate and coordinate recommendation as to the kind of this work of this kind to be do in particular region the congress will of course will determine the project to be select within the budget limit to carry out any twentieth|century program must give the executive branch of the government twentieth|century machinery to work with recognize that democratic process be necessarily and think rightly slow than dictatorial process but refuse to believe that democratic process need be dangerously slow for many|year have all know that the executive and administrative department of the government in washington be a higgledy piggledy patchwork of duplicate responsibility and overlap power the reorganization of this vast government machinery which propose to the congress last|winter do not conflict with the principle of the democratic process as some people say only make that process work more efficiently on recent trip many people have talk to about|the|million of man and woman and child who still work at insufficient wage and overlong hour american industry have search the outside world to find new market but can create on very doorstep the big and most permanent market have ever have see need the reduction of trade barrier to improve foreign market but should not overlook the chance to reduce the domestic trade barrier right here right away without wait for any treaty a|few|more|dollars a week in wage a well distribution of job with a short work day will almost overnight make million of lowest pay worker actual buyer of billions|of|dollar of industrial and farm product that increase volume of sale ought to lessen other cost of production so much that even a considerable increase in labor cost can be absorb without impose high price on the consumer be a firm believer in fully adequate pay for all labor but right now be most greatly concerned in increase the pay of the lowest pay labor those who be most numerous consuming group but who today do not make enough to maintain a decent standard of living or to buy the food and the clothe and the other article necessary to keep factory and farm fully run think that farsighte businessman already understand and agree with this policy agree also that no section of the country can permanently benefit or the rest of the country by maintain standard of wage and hour far that be far inferior to other section of the country most businessman big and little know that government neither want to put out of business nor to prevent from earn a decent profit in spite of the alarm of a few who seek to regain control of over american life most businessman big and little know that government be try to make property more secure than ever before by give every family a real chance to have a property stake in the nation whatever danger there may be to the property and profit of the many if there be any danger come not from government 's attitude toward business but from restraint now impose upon business by private monopoly and financial oligarchy the average businessman know that a high cost of living be a great deterrent to business and that business prosperity depend much upon a low price policy which encourage the wide possible consumption as of the country 's lead economist recently say the continuance of business recovery in the|united|state depend far more up)on business policy business pricing policy than do on anything that may be do or not do in washington competitive system be of course not altogether competitive anybody who buy any large quantity of manufacture good know this whether be the government or an individual buyer have anti - trust law to be sure but have not be adequate to check the growth of many monopoly whether or not may have be adequate originally adequate interpretation by the court and the difficulty and delay of legal procedure have now definitely limit effectiveness be already study how to strengthen anti - trust law in order to end monopoly not to hurt but to free legitimate business of the nation have touch briefly on these important subject which take together make a program for the immediate future and know will realize that to attain legislation be necessary as plan today for the creation of ever high standard of live for the people of the|united|state be aware that plan may be most seriously affect by event in the world outside border by a series of trade agreement have be attempt to recreate the trade of the world which that trade of the world that play so important a part in domestic prosperity but know that if the world outside border fall into the chaos of war world trade will be completely disrupt nor can view with indifference the destruction of civilized value throughout the world seek peace not only for generation but also for the generation of child seek for child the continuance of world civilization in order that american civilization may continue to be invigorate help by the achievement of civilized man and woman in all the rest of the world want great democracy to be wise enough to realize that aloofness from war be not promote by unawareness of war in a world of mutual suspicion peace must be affirmatively reach for can not just be wish for and can not just be wait for have now make known willingness to attend a conference of the party to the nine power treaty of the treaty of washington of which be of the original signatory the purpose of this conference will be to seek by agreement a solution of the present situation in china in effort to find that solution be purpose to cooperate with the other signatory to this treaty include china and japan such cooperation would be an example of of the possible path to follow in search for mean toward peace throughout the whole world the development of civilization and of human welfare be base on the acceptance by individual of certain fundamental decency in relation with each other and equally the development of peace in the world be dependent similarly on the acceptance by nation of certain fundamental decency in relation with each other ultimately hope each nation will accept the fact that violation of these rule of conduct be an injury to the well being of all nation meanwhile remember that from to personally be fairly close to world event and in that period while learn much of what to do also learn much of what not to do the common sense the intelligence of the people of america agree with statement that america hate war america hope for peace therefore america actively engage in the search for peace view transcript transcript be glad to come once again to chicago and especially to have the opportunity of take part in the dedication of this important project of civic betterment on trip across the continent and back have be show many evidence of the result of common sense cooperation between municipality and and have be greet by tens|of|thousand of americans who have tell in every look and word that material and spiritual well being have make great stride forward in the|past|few|year and yet as have see with own eye the prosperous farm the thrive factory and the busy railroad as have see the happiness and security and peace which cover wide land almost inevitably have be compel to contrast peace with very different scene be enact in other part of the world be because the people of the|united|state under modern condition must for the sake of own future give thought to the rest of the world that as the responsible executive head of the nation have choose this great inland city and this gala occasion to speak to on a subject of definite national importance the political situation in the world which of late have be grow progressively bad be such as to cause grave concern and anxiety to all the people and nation who wish to live in peace and amity with neighbor some|fifteen|years|ago the hope of mankind for a continue era of international peace be raise to great height when more|than|sixty nation solemnly pledge not to resort to arm in furtherance of national aim and policy the high aspiration express in the|briand kellogg|peace|pact and the hope for peace thus raise have of late give way to a haunting fear of calamity the present reign of terror and international lawlessness begin a|few|years|ago begin through unjustified interference in the internal affair of other nation or the invasion of alien territory in violation of treaty and have now reach a stage where the very foundation of civilization be seriously threaten the landmark and tradition which have mark the progress of civilization toward a condition of law order and justice be be wipe away without a declaration of war and without warning or justification of any kind civilian include vast number of woman and child be be ruthlessly murder with bomb from the air in time of so call peace ship be be attack and sink by submarine without cause or notice nation be foment and take side in civil warfare in nation that have never do any harm nation claim freedom for deny to other innocent people innocent nation be be cruelly sacrifice to a greed for power and supremacy which be devoid of all sense of justice and humane consideration to paraphrase a recent author perhaps foresee a time when man exultant in the technique of homicide will rage so hotly over the world that every precious thing will be in danger every book and picture and harmony every treasure garner through millennium the small the delicate the defenseless all will be lose or wreck or utterly destroy if those thing come to pass in other part of the world let no one imagine that america will escape that america may expect mercy that this|western|hemisphere will not be attack and that will continue tranquilly and peacefully to carry on the ethic and the art of civilization if those day come there will be no safety by arm no help from authority no answer in science the storm will rage till every flower of culture be trample and all human being be level in a vast chaos if those|day be not to come to pass — if be to have a world in which can breathe freely and live in amity without fear the peace love nation must make a concerted effort to uphold law and principle on which alone peace can rest secure the peace love nation must make a concerted effort in opposition to those violation of treaty and those ignoring of humane instinct which today be create a state of international anarchy and instability from which there be no escape through mere isolation or neutrality those who cherish freedom and recognize and respect the equal right of neighbor to be free and live in peace must work together for the triumph of law and moral principle in order that peace justice and confidence may prevail in the world there must be a return to a belief in the pledged word in the value of a sign treaty there must be recognition of the fact that national morality be as vital as private morality a bishop write the|other|day seem to that something greatly need to be say in behalf of ordinary humanity against the present practice of carry the horror of war to helpless civilian especially woman and child may be that such a protest may be regard by many who claim to be realist as futile but may not be that the heart of mankind be so fill with horror at the present needless suffering that that force could be mobilize in sufficient volume to lessen such cruelty in the|days|ahead even though may take twenty|years which god forbid for civilization to make effective corporate protest against this barbarism surely strong voice may hasten the|day there be a solidarity and interdependence about the modern world both technically and morally which make impossible for any nation completely to isolate from economic and political upheaval in the rest of the world especially when such upheaval appear to be spread and not decline there can be no stability or peace either within nation or between nation except under law and moral standard adhere to by all international anarchy destroy every foundation for peace jeopardize either the immediate or the future security of every nation large or small be therefore a matter of vital interest and concern to the people of the|united|state that the sanctity of international treaty and the maintenance of international morality be restore the overwhelming majority of the people and nation of the world today want to live in peace seek the removal of barrier against trade want to exert in industry in agriculture and in business that may increase wealth through the production of wealth produce good rather than strive to produce military plane and bomb and machine gun and cannon for the destruction of human life and useful property in those nation of the world which seem to be pile armament on armament for purpose of aggression and those other nation which fear act of aggression against and security a very high proportion of national income be be spend directly for armament run from to as high as fifty|percent be fortunate the proportion that in the|united|state spend be far less- or twelve|percent how happy be that the circumstance of the moment permit to put money into bridge and boulevard dam and reforestation the conservation of soil and many other kind of useful work rather than into huge standing army and vast supply of implement of war be compel and be compel nevertheless to look ahead the peace the freedom and the security of ninety|percent of the population of the world be be jeopardize by the remain ten|percent who be threaten a breakdown of all international order and law surely the|ninety|percent who want to live in peace under law and in accordance with moral standard that have receive almost universal acceptance through the|century can and must find some way to make will prevail the situation be definitely of universal concern the question involve relate not merely to violation of specific provision of particular treaty be question of war and of peace of international law and especially of principle of humanity be true that involve definite violation of agreement and especially of the covenant of the league of nation the|briand kellogg|pact and the nine power treaty but also involve problem of world economy world security and world humanity be true that the moral consciousness of the world must recognize the importance of remove injustice and well found grievance but at the same time must be arouse to the cardinal necessity of honor sanctity of treaty of respect the right and liberty of other and of put an end to act of international aggression seem to be unfortunately true that the epidemic of world lawlessness be spread when an epidemic of physical disease start to spread the community approve and join in a quarantine of the patient in order to protect the health of the community against the spread of the disease be determination to pursue a policy of peace be determination to adopt every practicable measure to avoid involvement in war ought to be inconceivable that in this modern era and in the face of experience any nation could be so foolish and ruthless as to run the risk of plunge the whole world into war by invade and violate in contravention of solemn treaty the territory of other nation that have do no real harm and be too weak to protect adequately yet the peace of the world and the welfare and security of every nation include own be today be threaten by that very thing no nation which refuse to exercise forbearance and to respect the freedom and right of other can long remain strong and retain the confidence and respect of other nation no nation ever lose dignity or good standing by conciliate difference and by exercise great patience with and consideration for the right of other nation war be a contagion whether be declare or undeclared can engulf state and people remote from the original scene of hostility be determined to keep out of war yet can not insure against the disastrous effect of war and the danger of involvement be adopt such measure as will minimize risk of involvement but can not have complete protection in a world of disorder in which confidence and security have break down if civilization be to survive the principle of the prince of peace must be restore trust between nation must be revive most important of all the will for peace on the part of peace love nation must express to the end that nation that may be tempt to violate agreement and the right of other will desist from such a course there must be positive endeavor to preserve peace america hate war america hope for peace therefore america actively engage in the search for peace view transcript transcript last|thursday describe in detail certain economic problem which everyone admit now face the nation for the many message which have come to after that speech and which be physically impossible to answer individually take this means of say thank tonight sit at desk in the|white|house make first radio report to the people in second term of office be remind of that evening in march when make first radio report to be then in the midst of the great banking crisis soon after with the authority of the congress ask the nation to turn over all of privately hold gold dollar for dollar to today 's recovery prove how right that policy be but when almost|two|years|later come before the|supreme|court constitutionality be uphold only by a to vote the change of vote would have throw all the affair of this great nation back into hopeless chaos in effect justices rule that the right under a private contract to exact a pound of flesh be more sacred than the main objective of the constitution to establish an endure nation in and know that must never let economic system get completely out of joint again that could not afford to take the risk of another great depression also become convinced that the only way to avoid a repetition of those dark day be to have a government with power to prevent and to cure the abuse and the inequality which have throw that system out of joint then begin a program of remedy those abuse and inequality to give balance and stability to economic system to make bomb proof against the cause of today be only part way through that program and recovery be speed up to a point where the danger of be again become possible not this|week or month perhaps but within national law be need to complete that program individual or local or state effort alone can not protect in any well than ten|years|ago will take time and plenty of time to work out remedy administratively even after legislation be pass to complete program of protection in time therefore can not delay moment in make certain that national|government have power to carry through four|years|ago action do not come until the|eleventh|hour be almost too late if learn anything from the depression will not allow to run around in new circle of futile discussion and debate always postpone of decision the american people have learn from the depression for in the last national election an overwhelming majority of vote a mandate that the congress and the president begin the task of provide that protection not after long year of debate but now the courts however have cast doubt on the ability of the elect congress to protect against catastrophe by meet squarely modern social and economic condition be at a crisis in ability to proceed with that protection be a quiet crisis there be no line of depositor outside close bank but to the far sighted be far reach in possibility of injury to america want to talk with very simply about the need for present action in this crisis the need to meet the unanswered challenge of third of a nation ill nourished ill clothe ill house last|thursday describe the american form of government as a horse team provide by the constitution to the american people so that field may be plow the horse be of course the branch of government the congress the executive and the courts of the horse be pull in unison today the third be not those who have intimate that the president of the|united|state be try to drive that team overlook the simple fact that the president as chief executive be of the horse be the american people who be in the driver 's seat be the american people who want the furrow plow be the american people who expect the third horse to pull in unison with the other hope that have re - read the|united|state in these|past|few|week like the bible ought to be read again and again be an easy document to understand when remember that be call into being because the|articles|of|confederation under which the original states try to operate after the revolution show the need of a|national|government with power enough to handle national problem in preamble the constitution state that be intend to form a more perfect union and promote the general welfare and the power give to the congress to carry out those purpose can be best describe by say that be all the power need to meet each and every problem which then have a national character and which could not be meet by merely local action but the framer go further have in mind that in succeed generation many other problem then undreamed of would become national problem give to the congress the ample broad power to levy taxis and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the|united|state that friend be what honestly believe to have be the clear and underlying purpose of the patriot who write a|federal|constitution to create a national government with national power intend as say to form a more perfect union for and posterity for nearly|twenty|year there be no conflict between the congress and the court then congress pass a statute which in the court say violate an express provision of the constitution the court claim the power to declare unconstitutional and do so declare but a little later the court admit that be an extraordinary power to exercise and through mr. justice washington lay down this limitation upon be but a decent respect due to the wisdom the integrity and the patriotism of the legislative body by which any law be pass to presume in favor of validity until violation of the constitution be prove beyond all reasonable doubt but since the rise of the modern movement for social and economic progress through legislation the court have more and more often and more and more boldly assert a power to veto law pass by the congress and in complete disregard of this original limitation in the|last|four|years the sound rule of give statute the benefit of all reasonable doubt have be cast aside the court have be act not as a judicial body but as a policy make body when the congress have seek to stabilize national agriculture to improve the condition of labor to safeguard business against unfair competition to protect national resource and in many other way to serve clearly national need the majority of the court have be assume the power to pass on the wisdom of these act of the congress and to approve or disapprove the public policy write into these law that be not only accusation be the accusation of most distinguished justice of the present supreme|court have not the time to quote to all the language use by dissent justice in many of these case but in the case hold the|railroad|retirement|act unconstitutional for instance chief justice hughes say in a dissent opinion that the majority opinion be a departure from sound principle and place an unwarranted limitation upon the commerce clause and other justice agree with in the case of hold the aaa unconstitutional justice|stone say of the majority opinion that be a torture construction of the constitution and other justice agree with in the case hold the new|york minimum wage law unconstitutional justice|stone say that the majority be actually read into the constitution own personal economic predilection and that if the legislative power be not leave free to choose the method of solve the problem of poverty subsistence and health of large number in the community then government be to be render impotent and other justice agree with in the face of these dissent opinion there be no basis for the claim make by some member of the court that something in the constitution have compel regretfully to thwart the will of the people in the face of such dissent opinion be perfectly clear that as chief justice hughes have say be under a constitution but the constitution be what the judge say be the court in addition to the proper use of judicial function have improperly set up as a third house of the congress a super - legislature as of the justice have call read into the constitution word and implication which be not there and which be never intend to be there have therefore reach the point as a nation where must take action to save the constitution from the court and the court from must find a way to take an appeal from the|supreme|court to the constitution want a|supreme|court which will do justice under the constitution and not over in court want a government of law and not of man want as all americans want an independent judiciary as propose by the framer of the constitution that mean a|supreme|court that will enforce the constitution as write that will refuse to amend the constitution by the arbitrary exercise of judicial power in other word by judicial say so do not mean a judiciary so independent that can deny the existence of fact which be universally recognize how then could proceed to perform the mandate give be say in last|year 's democratic platform if these problem can not be effectively solve within the constitution shall seek such clarify amendment as will assure the power to enact those law adequately to regulate commerce protect public health and safety and safeguard economic security in other word say would seek an amendment only if every other possible mean by legislation be to fail when commence to review the situation with the problem squarely before come by a process of elimination to the conclusion that short of amendment the only method which be clearly constitutional and would at the same time carry out other much need reform be to infuse new blood into all courts must have man worthy and equip to carry out impartial justice but at the same time must have judge who will bring to the courts a present day sense of the constitution judges who will retain in the courts the judicial function of a court and reject the legislative power which the court have today assume in out of the state of the union judges be choose not for life but for a|period|of|year in many states judges must retire at the age of congress have provide financial security by offer life pension at full pay for federal|judge on all courts who be willing to retire at in the case of supreme|court justices that pension be a year but all federal|judge once appoint can if choose hold office for life no matter how old may get to be what be proposal be simply this whenever a judge or justice of any federal|court have reach the age of and do not avail of the opportunity to retire on a pension a new member shall be appoint by the president then in office with the approval as require by the constitution of the senate of the|united|state that plan have chief purpose by bring into the judicial system a steady and continue stream of new and young blood hope first to make the administration of all federal justice speedier and therefore less costly secondly to bring to the decision of social and economic problem young man who have have personal experience and contact with modern fact and circumstance under which average man have to live and work this plan will save national constitution from harden of the judicial artery the number of judges to be appoint would depend wholly on the decision of present judges now over or those who would subsequently reach the|age|of|seventy if for instance any of the justices of the|supreme|court now over the age of should retire as provide under the plan no additional place would be create consequently although there never can be more|than|fifteen there may be or or and there may be only|nine there be nothing novel or radical about this idea seek to maintain the federal bench in full vigor have be discuss and approve by many person of high authority ever since a similar proposal pass the|house|of|representatives in why be the age fix at because the law of many states the practice of the|civil|service the regulation of the army and navy and the rule of many of university and of almost every great private business enterprise commonly fix the retirement age at seventy|year or less the statute would apply to all the court in the federal system there be general approval so far as the low federal court be concern the plan have meet opposition only so far as the|supreme|court of the|united|state be concern if such a plan be good for the low court certainly ought to be equally good for the high court from which there be no appeal those oppose this plan have seek to arouse prejudice and fear by cry that be seek to pack the|supreme|court and that a baneful precedent will be establish what do mean by the word pack the court let answer this question with a bluntness that will end all honest misunderstanding of purpose if by that phrase pack the court be charge that wish to place on the bench spineless puppet who would disregard the law and would decide specific case as wish to be decide make this answer that no president fit for office would appoint and no senate of honorable man fit for office would confirm that kind of appointee to the|supreme|court but if by that phrase the charge be make that would appoint and the senate would confirm justices worthy to sit beside present member of the court who understand those modern condition that will appoint justices who will not undertake to override the judgment of the congress on legislative policy that will appoint justices who will act as justices and not as legislator if the appointment of such justices can be call pack the courts then say that and with the vast majority of the american people favor do just that thing- now be a dangerous precedent for the congress to change the number of the justices the congress have always have and will have that power the number of justice have be change several time before in the administration|of|john|adams and thomas|jefferson both signer of the|declaration|of|independence|-|andrew jackson abraham|lincoln and ulysses|s.|grant suggest only the addition of justices to the bench in accordance with a clearly define principle relate to a clearly define age limit fundamentally if in the future america can not trust the congress elect to refrain from abuse of constitutional usage democracy will have fail far beyond the importance to of any king of precedent concern the judiciary think so much in the public interest to maintain a vigorous judiciary that encourage the retirement of elderly judges by offer a life pension at full salary why then should leave the fulfillment of this public policy to chance or make independent on upon the desire or prejudice of any individual justice be the clear intention of public policy to provide for a constant flow of new and young blood into the judiciary normally every president appoint a large number of district|and|circuit|court|judges and a few member of the|supreme|court until first term practically every president of the|united|state have appoint at|least|one member of the|supreme|court president taft appoint member and name a chief justice president wilson president harding include a chief justice president coolidge president hoover include a chief justice such a succession of appointment should have provide a court well balance as to age but chance and the disinclination of individual to leave the supreme bench have now give a court in which justices will be over five|years|of|age|before next|june and over thus a sound public policy have be defeat now propose that establish by law an assurance against any such ill balance court in the future propose that hereafter when a judge reach the age of a new and young judge shall be add to the court automatically in this way propose to enforce a sound public policy by law instead of leave the composition of federal|court include the high to be determine by chance or the personal indecision of individual if such a law as propose be regard as establish a new precedent be not a most desirable precedent like all lawyer like all americans regret the necessity of this controversy but the welfare of the|united|state and indeed of the constitution be what all must think about first difficulty with the court today rise not from the court as an institution but from human being within but can not yield constitutional destiny to the personal judgement of a few man who be fearful of the future would deny the necessary mean of deal with the present this plan of mine be no attack on the court seek to restore the court to rightful and historic place in constitutional government and to have resume high task of build anew on the constitution a system of live law the court can best undo what the court have do have thus explain to the reason that lie behind effort to secure result by legislation within the constitution hope that thereby the difficult process of constitutional amendment may be render unnecessary but let examine the process there be many type of amendment propose each one be radically different from the other there be no substantial group within the congress or outside who be agree on any single amendment would take month or year to get substantial agreement upon the type and language of the amendment would take month and year thereafter to get a third majority in favor of that amendment in both houses of the congress then would come the long course of ratification by fourth of all the states no amendment which any powerful economic interest or the leader of any powerful political party have have reason to oppose have ever be ratify within anything like a reasonable time and state which contain of the voting population can block ratification even though the state with five|percent of the population be in favor of a very large percentage of newspaper publisher who be try to give the impression that really do want a constitutional amendment would be the first to exclaim as soon as an amendment be propose oh be for an amendment all right but this amendment propose be not the kind of amendment that be think about be therefore go to spend time effort and money to block the amendment although would be awfully glad to help get some other kind od amendment ratify group oppose plan on the ground that favor a constitutional amendment the first include those who fundamentally object to social and economic legislation along modern line this be the same group who during the campaign last|fall try to block the mandate of the people now be make a last stand and the strategy of that last stand be to suggest the time consume process of amendment in order to kill off by delay the legislation demand by the mandate to say do not think will be able long to fool the american people as to purpose the other group be compose of those who honestly believe the amendment process be the good and who would be willing to support a reasonable amendment if could agree on to say can not rely on an amendment as the immediate or only answer to present difficulty when the time come for action will find that many of those who pretend to support will sabotage any constructive amendment which be propose look at these strange bed fellow of when before have find really at side in fight for progress and remember thing more even if an amendment be pass and even if in the|year to come be to be ratified meaning would depend upon the kind of justices who would be sit on the|supreme|court|bench an amendment like the rest of the constitution be what the justices say be rather than what framer or may hope be this proposal of mine will not infringe in the slight upon the civil or religious liberty so dear to every american record as governor and president prove devotion to those liberty who know can have no fear that would tolerate the destruction by any branch of government of any part of heritage of freedom the present attempt by those oppose to progress to play upon the fear of danger to personal liberty bring again to mind that crude and cruel strategy try by the same opposition to frighten the worker of america in a pay envelope propaganda against the|social|security|law the worker be not fool by that propaganda then the people of america will not be fool by such propaganda now be in favor of action through legislation first because believe that can be pass at this session of the congress second because will provide a reinvigorated liberal minded judiciary necessary to furnish quicker and cheap justice from bottom to top third because will provide a series of federal|courts willing to enforce the constitution as write and unwilling to assert legislative power by write into own political and economic policy during the|past|half|century the balance of power between the great branch of the|federal|government have be tip out of balance by the courts in direct contradiction of the high purpose of the framer of the constitution be purpose to restore that balance who know will accept solemn assurance that in a world in which democracy be under attack seek to make american democracy succeed and will do part view transcript transcript when four|years|ago meet to inaugurate president the republic single

because these family will earn enough by work not only to subsist but to buy food for stock and seed for next|year 's planting into this scheme of thing there fit of course the government lending agency which next|year as in the past will help with production loan every governor with whom have talk be in full accord with this program of do work for these farm family just as every governor agree that the individual state will take care of unemployable but that the cost of employ those who be entirely able and willing to work must be bear by if then know as do today the approximate number of farm family who will require some form of work relief from now on through the|winter face the question of what kind of work should do let make clear that this be not a new question because have already be answer to a great or less extent in every of the drought community begin in when also have serious drought condition the state and federal government cooperate in plan a large number of project many of directly aim at the alleviation of future drought condition in accordance with that program literally thousand of pond or small reservoir have be build in order to supply water for stock and to lift the level of the underground water to protect well from go dry thousand of well have be drill or deepen community lake have be create and irrigation project be be push water conservation by mean such as these be be expand as a result of this new drought all through the great|plain area the western corn belt and in the state that lie further south in the middle|w water conservation be not so press a problem here the work project run more to soil erosion control and the building of farm to market road spend like this be not waste would spell future waste if do not spend for such thing now these emergency work project provide money to buy food and clothing for the winter keep the livestock on the farm provide seed for a new crop and good of all will conserve soil and water in the future in those area most frequently hit by drought if for example in some local area the water table continue to drop and the topsoil to blow away the land value will disappear with the water and the soil people on the farm will drift into the nearby city the city will have no farm trade and the worker in the city factory and store will have no job property value in the city will decline if on the other hand the farm within that area remain as farm with well water supply and no erosion the farm population will stay on the land and prosper and the nearby city will prosper too property value will increase instead of disappear that be why be worth while as a nation to spend money in order to save money have however use the argument in relation only to a small area hold good in effect on the nation as a whole every state in the drought area be now do and always will do business with every state outside the very existence of the man and woman work in the clothing factory of new|york make clothe wear by farmer and family of the worker in the steel mill in pittsburgh in the automobile factory of detroit and in the harvester factory of illinois depend upon the farmer ' ability to purchase the commodity produce in the same way be the purchase power of the worker in these factory in the city that enable and wife and child to eat more beef more pork more wheat more corn more fruit and more dairy product and to buy more clothing make from cotton wool and leather in a physical and a property sense as well as in a spiritual sense be member of another want to make clear that no simple panacea can be apply to the drought problem in the whole of the drought area plan must depend on local condition for these vary with annual rainfall soil characteristic altitude and topography water and soil conservation method may differ in county from those in an adjoin county work to be do in the cattle and sheep country differ in type from work in the wheat country or work in the corn belt the great plains drought area committee have give preliminary recommendation for a long time program for that region use that report as a basis be cooperate successfully and in entire accord with the governors and state planning board as get this program into operation the people more and more will be able to maintain securely on the land that will mean a steady decline in the relief burden which the|federal|government and state have have to assume in time of drought but more important will mean a great contribution to general national prosperity by these region which have be hit by drought will conserve and improve not only property value but human value the people in the drought area do not want to be dependent on federal state or any other kind of charity want for and family an opportunity to share fairly by own effort in the progress of america the farmer of america want a sound national agricultural policy in which a permanent land use program will have an important place want assurance against when make good crop but have to sell for price that mean ruin just as surely as do the drought sound policy must maintain farm price in good crop year as well as in bad crop year must function when have drought must also function when have bumper crop the maintenance of a fair equilibrium between farm price and the price of industrial product be an aim which must keep ever before just as must give constant thought to the sufficiency of the food supply of the nation even in bad|year modern civilization can and should devise a more successful mean by which the excess supply of bumper year can be conserve for use in lean year on trip have be deeply impressed with the general efficiency of those agency of the federal state and local government which have move in on the immediate task create by the drought in none of have preparation work without blueprint and make the mistake of inexperience hindsight show this but as time have go on have be make few and few mistake remember that the federal and state government have do only broad planning actual work on a give project originate in the local community local need be list from local information local project be decide on only after obtain the recommendation and help of those in the local community who be best able to give and be worthy of note that on entire trip though ask the question dozen of time hear no complaint against the character of a single work relief project the elect head of the state concern together with state official and expert from agricultural college and state planning board have show cooperation with and approval of the work which the|federal|government have head up be grateful also to the man and woman in all these state who have accept leadership in the work in locality in the drought area people be not afraid to use new method to meet change in nature and to correct mistake of the past if overgrazing have injure range land be willing to reduce the grazing if certain wheat land should be return to pasture be willing to cooperate if tree should be plant as windbreak or to stop erosion will work with if terracing or summer fallowing or crop rotation be call for will carry out stand ready to fit and not to fight the way of nature be help and shall continue to help the farmer to do those thing through local soil conservation committee and other cooperative local state and federal agency of government have not the time tonight to deal with other and more comprehensive agricultural policy with this fine help be tide over the present emergency be go to conserve soil conserve water and conserve life be go to have long time defense against both low price and drought be go to have a farm policy that will serve the national welfare that be hope for the future there be reason why want to end by talk about reemployment tomorrow be labor|day the brave spirit with which so|many|million of work people be win way out of depression deserve respect and admiration be like the courage of the farmer in the drought area that be first reason the second be that healthy employment condition stand equally with healthy agricultural condition as a buttress of national prosperity dependable employment at fair wage be just as important to the people in the town and city as good farm income be to agriculture people must have the ability to buy the good manufacture and the crop produce thus city wage and farm buying power be the strong leg that carry the nation forward re - employment in industry be proceed rapidly government spending be in large part responsible for keep industry go and put in a position to make this reemployment possible government order be the backlog of heavy industry government wage turn over and over again to make consumer purchasing power and to sustain every merchant in the community businessman with business small and large have to be save private enterprise be necessary to any nation which seek to maintain the democratic form of government in case just as certainly as in the case of drought stricken farmer government spending have save government have spend wisely to save private industry begin to take worker off the roll of the government relief program until this administration have no free employment service except in a few state and city because there be no unified employment service the worker force to move as industry move often travel over the country wander after job which seem always to travel just a little faster than do be often victimize by fraudulent practice of employment clearing house and the fact of employment opportunity be at the disposal neither of nor of the employer in the|united|states|employment|service be create a cooperative state and federal enterprise through which the federal|government match dollar for dollar the fund provide by the state for register the occupation and skill of worker and for actually find job for these register worker in private industry the federal state cooperation have be splendid already employment service be operate in state and the area not cover by be serve by have develop a nationwide service with seven|hundred district office and one|thousand branch office thus provide facility through which labor can learn of job available and employer can find worker last|spring express the hope that employer would realize deep responsibility to take man off the relief roll and give job in private enterprise subsequently be tell by many employer that be not satisfied with the information available concern the skill and experience of the worker on the relief roll on august|25th allocate a relatively small sum to the employment service for the purpose of get well and more recent information in regard to those now actively at work on wpa|project information as to skill and previous occupation and to keep the record of such man and woman up to date for maximum service in make available to industry tonight be announce the allocation of half dollar more to enable the|employment|service to make an even more intensive search then have yet be equip to make to find opportunity in private employment for worker register with tonight urge the worker to cooperate with and take full advantage of this intensification of the work of the|employment|service this do not mean that there will be any lessening of effort under wpa and pwa and other work relief program until all worker have decent job in private employment at decent wage do not surrender responsibility to the unemployed have have ample proof that be the will of the american people that those who represent in national state and local government should continue as long as necessary to discharge that responsibility but do mean that the government want to use resource to get private work for those now employ on government work and thus to curtail to a minimum the government expenditure for direct employment tonight ask employer large and small throughout the nation to use the help of the state and federal|employment|service whenever in the general pick up of business require more worker

the employer employee relationship should be between free man and equal refuse to regard those who work with hand or brain as different from or inferior to those who live from property insist that labor be entitle to as much respect as property but worker with hand and brain deserve more than respect for labor deserve practical protection in the opportunity to use labor at a return adequate to support at a decent and constantly rise standard of living and to accumulate a margin of security against the inevitable vicissitude of life the average man must have that twofold opportunity if be to avoid the growth of a class conscious society in this country there be those who fail to read both the sign of the time and american history would try to refuse the worker any effective power to bargain collectively to earn a decent livelihood and to acquire security be those short sight one not labor who threaten this country with that class dissension which in other country have lead to dictatorship and the establishment of fear and hatred as the dominant emotion in human life all american worker brain worker and manual worker alike and all the rest of whose well being depend on know

tender join with be enlist for the duration of the war view transcript transcript since annual message to the congress on january|fourth last have not address the general public over the air in the|many|weeks since that time the congress have devote to the arduous task of formulate legislation necessary to the country 's welfare have make and be make distinct progress before come to any of the specific measure however want to leave in mind clear fact the administration and the congress be not proceed in any haphazard fashion in this task of government each of step have a definite relationship to every other step the job of create a program for the nation 's welfare be in some respect like the building of a ship at different point on the coast where often visit build great seagoing ship when of these ship be under construction and the steel frame have be set in the keel be difficult for a person who do not know ship to tell how will finally look when be sail the high sea may seem confused to some but out of the multitude of detailed part that go into the making of the structure the creation of a useful instrument for man ultimately come be that way with the making of a national policy the objective of the nation have greatly change in three|years before that time individual self interest and group selfishness be paramount in public thinking the general good be at a discount three|year of hard thinking have change the picture more and more people because of clear thinking and a well understanding be consider the whole rather than a mere part relate to section or to crop or to industry or to an individual private occupation that be a tremendous gain for the principle of democracy the overwhelming majority of people in this country know how to sift the wheat from the chaff in what hear and what read know that the process of the constructive rebuilding of america can not be do in a|day|or|a|year but that be be do in spite of the few who seek to confuse and to profit by confusion americans as a whole be feel a lot well a lot more cheerful than for many many year the most difficult place in the world to get a clear open perspective of the country as a whole be washington be remind sometimes of what president wilson once say so many people come to washington who know thing that be not so and so few people who know anything about what the people of the|united|state be think about that be why occasionally leave this scene of action for a|few|day to go fishing or back home to hyde|park so that can have a chance to think quietly about the country as a whole to get away from the tree as say and to look at the whole forest this duty of see the country in a long range perspective be which in a very special manner attach to this office to which have choose do ever stop to think that there be after all only|two position in the nation that be fill by the vote of all of the voter the president and the vice president that make particularly necessary for the vice president and for to conceive of duty toward the entire country speak therefore tonight to and of the american people as a whole most immediate concern be in carry out the purpose of the great work program just enact by the congress first objective be to put man and woman now on the relief roll to work and incidentally to assist materially in already unmistakable march toward recovery shall not confuse discussion by a multitude of figure so many figure be quote to prove so many thing sometimes depend upon what paper read and what broadcast hear therefore let keep mind on two|or|three simple essential fact in connection with this problem of unemployment be true that while business and industry be definitely well relief roll be still too large however for the first time in five|year the relief roll have decline instead of increase during the|winter|months be still decline the simple fact be that many|million more people have private work or one|year|ago today and every|day that pass offer more chance to work for those who want to work in spite of the fact that unemployment remain a serious problem here as in every other nation have come to recognize the possibility and the necessity of certain helpful remedial measure these measure be of kind the first be to make provision intend to relieve to minimize and to prevent future unemployment the second be to establish the practical mean to help those who be unemployed in this present emergency social security legislation be an attempt to answer the first of these question work relief program the second the program for social security now pende before the congress be a necessary part of the future unemployment policy of the government while present and project expenditure for work relief be wholly within the reasonable limit of national credit resource be obvious that can not continue to create governmental deficit for that|purpose|year|after|year must begin now to make provision for the future that be why social security program be an important part of the complete picture propose by mean of old age pension to help those who have reach the age of retirement to give up job and thus give to the young generation great opportunity for work and to give to all a feeling of security as look toward old age the unemployment insurance part of the legislation will not only help to guard the individual in future period of lay off against dependence upon relief but will by sustain purchasing power cushion the shock of economic distress another helpful feature of unemployment insurance be the incentive will give to employer to plan more carefully in order that unemployment may be prevent by the stabilizing of employment provision for social security however be protection for the future responsibility for the immediate necessity of the unemployed have be meet by the congress through the most comprehensive work plan in the history of the nation problem be to put to work and half employable person now on the relief roll be a problem quite as much for private industry as for the government be lose no time get the government 's vast work relief program underway and have every reason to believe that should be in full swing by autumn in direct shall recognize fundamental principle the project should be useful project shall be of a nature that a considerable proportion of the money spend will go into wage for labor project which promise ultimate return to the|federal|treasury of a considerable proportion of the cost will be seek fund allot for each project should be actually and promptly spend and not hold over until later|years in all case project must be of a character to give employment to those on the relief roll project will be allocate to locality or relief area in relation to the number of worker on relief roll in those area next want to make clear exactly how shall direct the work have set up a division|of|applications|and|information to which all proposal for the expenditure of money must go for preliminary study and consideration after the|division|of|applications|and|information have sift those project will be send to an allotment|division compose of representative of the more important governmental agency charge with carry on work relief project the group will also include representative of city and of labor farming banking and industry this|allotment|division will consider all of the recommendation submit to and such project as approve will be next submit to the president who under the act be require to make final allocation the next step will be to notify the proper government agency in whose field the project fall and also to notify another agency which be create a|progress|division this division will have the duty of coordinate the purchase of material and supply and of make certain that people who be employ will be take from the relief roll will also have the responsibility of determine work payment in various locality of make full use of exist employment service and to assist people engage in relief work to move as rapidly as possible back into private employment when such employment be available moreover this division will be charge with keep project move on schedule have feel to be essentially wise and prudent to avoid so far as possible the creation of new governmental machinery for supervise this work the|national|government now have at|least|sixty different agency with the staff and the experience and the competence necessary to carry on the two|hundred|and|fifty|or|three|hundred kind of work that will be undertake these agency therefore will simply be do on a somewhat enlarged scale the same sort of thing that have be do this will make certain that the large possible portion of the fund allot will be spend for actually create new work and not for build up expensive overhead organization here in washington for many|months preparation have be under way the allotment of fund for desirable project have already begin the key man for the major responsibility of this great task already have be select well realize that the country be expect before this|year be out to see the dirt fly as say in carry on the work and assure fellow citizen that no energy will be spare in use these fund effectively to make a major attack upon the problem of unemployment responsibility be to all of the people in this country this be a great national crusade to destroy enforce idleness which be an enemy of the human spirit generate by this depression attack upon these enemy must be without stint and without discrimination no sectional no political distinction can be permit must however be recognize that when an enterprise of this character be extend over more|than|three|thousand county throughout the nation there may be occasional instance of inefficiency bad management or misuse of fund when case of this kind occur there will be those of course who will try to tell that the exceptional failure be characteristic of the entire endeavor should be remember that in every big job there be some imperfection there be chiseler in every walk of life there be those in every industry who be guilty of unfair practice every profession have black sheep but long experience in government have teach that the exceptional instance of wrong do in government be probably less numerous than in almost every other line of endeavor the most effective mean of prevent such evil in this work relief program will be the eternal vigilance of the american people call upon fellow citizen everywhere to cooperate with in make this the most efficient and the clean example of public enterprise the world have ever see be time to provide a smashing answer for those cynical man who say that a democracy can not be honest and efficient if will help this can be do therefore hope will watch the work in every corner of this nation feel free to criticize tell of instance where work can be do better or where improper practice prevail neither nor want criticism conceive in a purely fault find or partisan spirit but be jealous of the right of every citizen to call to the attention of or government example of how the public money can be more effectively spend for the benefit of the american people now come friend to a part of the remain business before the congress have under consideration many measure which provide for the rounding out of the program of economic and social reconstruction with which have be concern for two|year can mention only a few of tonight but do not want mention of specific measure to be interpret as lack of interest in or disapproval of many other important proposal that be pende the national industrial recovery act expire on the|sixteenth|of|june after careful consideration have ask the congress to extend the life of this useful agency of government as have proceed with the administration of this act have find from time to time more and more useful way of promote purpose no reasonable person want to abandon present gain must continue to protect child to enforce minimum wage to prevent excessive|hours to safeguard define and enforce collective bargaining and while retain fair competition to eliminate so far as humanly possible the kind of unfair practice by selfish minority which unfortunately do more than anything else to bring about the recent collapse of industry there be likewise pende before the congress legislation to provide for the elimination of unnecessary hold company in the public utility field consider this legislation a positive recovery measure power production in this country be virtually back to the peak the operate company in the gas

community pretend to serve even more significantly have give the country as a whole an uneasy apprehension of over concentrate economic power a business that lose the confidence of customer and the good will of the public can not long continue to be a good risk for the investor this legislation will serve the investor by end the condition which have cause that lack of confidence and good will will put the public utility operate industry on a sound basis for the future both in public relation and in internal relation this legislation will not only in the long run result in provide low electric and gas rate to the consumer but will protect the actual value and earn power of property now own by thousand of investor who have little protection under the old law against what use to be

ownership be retain while the public stake in these important service be protect by the public 's government finally the reestablishment of public confidence in the bank of the nation be of the most hopeful result of effort as a nation to reestablish public confidence in private banking all know that private banking actually exist by virtue of the permission of and regulation by the people as a whole speak through government wise public policy however require not only that banking be safe but that resource be most fully utilize in the economic life of the country to this end be decide more than that the government should assume the responsibility of provide a means by which the credit of the nation may be control not by a few private banking institution but by a body with public prestige and authority the answer to this demand be the|federal|reserve|system twenty|year of experience with this system have justify the effort make to create but these|twenty|years have show by experience definite possibility for improvement certain proposal make to amend the|federal|reserve|act deserve prompt and favorable action by the congress be a minimum of wise readjustment of federal|reserve system in the light of past experience and present need these measure have mention be in large part the program which under constitutional duty have recommend to the congress be essential factor in a rounded program for national recovery contemplate the enrichment of national life by a sound and rational ordering of various element and wise provision for the protection of the weak against the strong never since inauguration in march,|1933 have feel so unmistakably the atmosphere of recovery but be more than the recovery of the material basis of individual life be the recovery of confidence in democratic process and institution have survive all of the arduous burden and the threaten danger of a great economic calamity have in the dark moment of national trial retain faith in own ability to master destiny fear be vanish and confidence be grow on every side renew faith in the vast possibility of human being to improve material and spiritual status through the instrumentality of the democratic form of government that faith be receive just reward for that can be thankful to the god who watch over america view transcript transcript have pass since talk

uncertainty culminate in the collapse of the|spring|of|1933 be bring order out of the old chaos with a great certainty of the employment of labor at a reasonable wage and of more business at a fair profit these governmental and industrial development hold promise of new achievement for the nation man may differ as to the particular form of governmental activity with respect to industry and business but nearly all be agree that private enterprise in time such as these can not be leave without assistance and without reasonable safeguard lest destroy not only but also process of civilization the underlie necessity for such activity be indeed as strong now as be years|ago when elihu|root say the follow very significant word instead of the give and take of free individual contract the tremendous power of organization have combine great aggregation of capital in enormous industrial establishment work through vast agency of commerce and employ great masse of man in movement of production and transportation and trade so great in the mass that each individual concern in be quite helpless by the relation between the employer and the employ between the owner of aggregate capital and the unit of organize labor between the small producer the small trader the consumer and the great transporting and manufacturing and distribute agency all present new question for the solution of which the old reliance upon the free action of individual will appear quite inadequate and in many direction the intervention of that organize control which call government seem necessary to produce the same result of justice and right conduct which obtain through the attrition of individual before the new condition arise be in this spirit thus describe by secretary root that approach task of revive private enterprise in march,|1933 first problem be of course the banking situation because as know the bank have collapse some bank could not be save but the great majority of either through own resource or with government aid have be restore to complete public confidence this have give safety to million of depositor in these bank closely follow this great constructive effort have through various federal agency save debtor and creditor alike in many other field of enterprise such as loan on farm mortgage and home mortgage loan to the railroad and insurance company and finally help for home owner and industry in all of these effort the government have come to the assistance of business and with the full expectation that the money use to assist these enterprise will eventually be repay believe will be the second step have take in the restoration of normal business enterprise have be to clean up thoroughly unwholesome condition in the field of investment in this have have assistance from many banker and businessman most of whom recognize the past evil in the banking system in the sale of security in the deliberate encouragement of stock gambling in the sale of unsound mortgage and in many other way in which the public lose billions|of|dollars see that without change in the policy and method of investment there could be no recovery of public confidence in the security of saving the country now enjoy the safety of bank saving under the new banking law the careful checking of new security under the|securities|act and the curtailment of rank stock speculation through the|securities|exchange|act sincerely hope that as a result people will be discourage in unhappy effort to get rich quick by speculate in security the average person almost always lose only a very small minority of the people of this country believe in gamble as a substitute for the old philosophy of benjamin|franklin that the way to wealth be through work in meet the problem of industrial recovery the chief agency of the government have be the|national|recovery|administration under guidance trade and industry cover over|ninety|percent of all industrial employee have adopt code of fair competition which have be approve by the president under these code in the industry cover child labor have be eliminate the work day and the|work|week have be shorten minimum wage have be establish and other wage adjust toward a rise standard of living the emergency purpose of the|n.|r.|a. be to put man to work and since creation more|than|four|million person have be re - employ in great part through the cooperation of american business bring about under the code benefit of the|industrial|recovery|program have come not only to labor in the form of new job in relief from over work and in relief from under pay but also to the owner and manager of industry because together with a great increase in the payroll there have come a substantial rise in the total of industrial profit a rise from a deficit figure in the|first|quarter|of|1933 to a level of sustained profit within one|year from the inauguration of n.|r.|a. now should not be expect that even employ labor and capital would be completely satisfied with present condition employed worker have not by any mean all enjoy a return to the earning of prosperous time although million of hitherto under- privileged worker be today far better pay than ever before also billions|of|dollar of invest capital have today a great security of present and future earning power than before this be because of the establishment of fair competitive standard and because of relief from unfair competition in wage cut which depress market and destroy purchase power but be an undeniable fact that the restoration of other billion of sound investment to a reasonable earning power could not be bring about in one|year there be no magic formula no economic panacea which could simply revive over night the heavy industry and the trade dependent upon nevertheless the gain of trade and industry as a whole have be substantial in these gain and in the policy of the administration there be assurance that hearten all forward look man and woman with the confidence that be definitely rebuild political and economic system on the line lay down by the new deal line which as have so often make clear be in complete accord with the underlie principle of orderly popular government which americans have demand since the white man first come to these shore count in the future as in the past on the drive power of individual initiative and the incentive of fair private profit strengthen with the acceptance of those obligation to the public interest which rest upon all have the right to expect that this drive power will be give patriotically and whole heartedly to nation have pass through the formative period of code making in the|national|recovery|administration and have effect a reorganization of the|n.|r.|a. suited to the need of the next phase which be in turn a period of preparation for legislation which will determine permanent form in this recent reorganization have recognize distinct function first the legislative or policy make function second the administrative function of code making and revision and third the judicial function which include enforcement consumer complaint and the settlement of dispute between employer and employee and between employer and another be now prepared to move into this second phase on the basis of experience in the first phase under the able and energetic leadership of general johnson shall watch carefully the working of this new machinery for the second phase of n.|r.|a. modify where need modification and finally make recommendation to the congress in order that the function of n.|r.|a. which have prove worth may be make a part of the permanent machinery of government let call attention to the fact that the|national|industrial|recovery|act give businessman the opportunity have seek for year to improve business condition through what have be call self government in industry if the code which have be write have be too complicated if have go too far in such matter as price fixing and limitation of production let be remember that so far as possible consistent with the immediate public interest of this|past|year and the vital necessity of improve labor condition the representative of trade and industry be permit to write idea into the code be now time to review these action as a whole to determine through deliberative mean in the light of experience from the standpoint of the good of the industry as well as the general public interest whether the method and policy adopt in the emergency have be best calculate to promote industrial recovery and a permanent improvement of business and labor condition there may be a serious question as to the wisdom of many of those device to control production or to prevent destructive price cutting which many business organization have insist be necessary or whether effect may have be to prevent that volume of production which would make possible low price and increase employment another question arise as to whether in fix minimum wage on the basis of an hourly or weekly wage have reach into the heart of the problem which be to provide such annual earning for the low pay worker as will meet minimum need also question the wisdom of extend code requirement suit to the great industrial center and to large employer to the great number of small employer in the small community during industrial recovery have be to some extent retard by strike include a few of major importance would not minimize the inevitable loss to employer and employee and to the general public through such conflict but would point out that the extent and severity of labor dispute during this period have be far less than in any previous comparable period when the businessman of the country be demand the right to organize adequately to promote legitimate interest when the farmer be demand legislation which would give opportunity and incentive to organize for a common advance be natural that the worker should seek and obtain a statutory declaration of constitutional right to organize for collective bargaining as embody in section|7 a of the national industrial recovery act machinery set up by the federal government have provide some new method of adjustment both employer and employee mast share the blame of not use as fully as should the employer who turn away from impartial agency of peace who deny freedom of organization to employee or fail to make every reasonable effort at a peaceful solution of difference be not fully support the recovery effort of government the worker who turn away from these same impartial agency and decline to use good office to gain end be likewise not fully cooperate with government be time that make a clean cut effort to bring about that united action of management and labor which be of the high purpose of the|recovery|act have pass through more|than|a|year of education step by step have create all the government agency necessary to insure as a general rule industrial peace with justice for all those willing to use these agency whenever voluntary bargaining fail to produce a necessary agreement there should be at least a full and fair trial give to these mean of end industrial warfare and in such an effort should be able to secure for employer and employee and consumer the benefit that all derive from the continuous peaceful operation of essential enterprise accordingly propose to confer within the|coming|month with small group of those truly representative of large employer of labor and of large group of organize labor in order to seek cooperation in establish what may describe as a specific trial period of industrial peace from those willing to join in establish this hope for period of peace shall seek assurance of the making and maintenance of agreement which can be mutually rely upon under which wage hour and working condition may be determine and any later adjustment shall be make either by agreement or in case of disagreement through the mediation or arbitration of state or federal agency shall not ask either employer or employee permanently to lay aside the weapon common to industrial war but shall ask both group to give a fair trial to peaceful method of adjust conflict of opinion and interest and to experiment for a reasonable time with measure suitable to civilize industrial civilization closely allied to the|n.|r.|a. be the program of public|works provide for in the same act and design to put more man back to work both directly on the public work and indirectly in the industry supply the material for these public work to those who say that expenditure for public works and other mean for recovery be a waste that can not afford answer that no country however rich can afford the waste of human resource demoralization cause by vast unemployment be great extravagance morally be the great menace to social order some people try to tell that must make up mind that for the future shall permanently have million of unemployed just as other country have have for over|a|decade what may be necessary for those country be not responsibility to determine but as for this country stand or fall by refusal to accept as a necessary condition of future a permanent army of unemployed on the contrary must make a national principle that will not tolerate a large army of unemployed and that will arrange national economy to end present unemployment as soon as can and then to take wise measure against return do not want to think that be the destiny of any american to remain permanently on relief roll those fortunately few in number who be frighten by boldness and cow by the necessity for make decision complain that all have do be unnecessary and subject to great risk now that these people be come out of storm cellar forget that there ever be a storm point to england would have believe that england have make progress out of depression by a do nothing policy by let nature take course england have peculiarity and have our but do not believe any intelligent observer can accuse england of undue orthodoxy in the present emergency do england let nature take course no do england hold to the gold standard when reserve be threaten no have england go back to the gold standard today no do england hesitate to call in ten|billion|dollar of war bond bear interest to issue new bond therefore bear only|3|1/2|percent interest thereby save the|british|treasury dollar a year in interest alone no and let be record that the british banker help be not a fact that ever since the|year|1909 great|britain in many way have advance further along line of social security than the|united|state be not a fact that relation between capital and labor on the basis of collective bargaining be much further advanced in great|britain than in the|united|state be perhaps not strange that the conservative british press have tell with pardonable irony that much of new deal program be only an attempt to catch up with english reform that go back ten|years|or|more nearly all americans be sensible and calm people do not get greatly excited nor be peace of mind disturb whether be businessman or worker or farmer by awesome pronouncement concern the unconstitutionality of some of measure of recovery and relief and reform be not frighten by reactionary lawyer or political editor all of these cry have be hear before more than when theodore|roosevelt and woodrow|wilson be attempt to correct abuse in national life the great chief justice white say there be great danger seem to to arise from the constant habit which prevail where anything be oppose or object to of refer without rhyme or reason to the constitution as a means of prevent accomplishment thus create the general impression that the constitution be but a barrier to progress instead of be the broad highway through which alone true progress may be enjoy in effort for recovery have avoid on the hand the theory that business should and must be take over into an all embrace government have avoid on the other hand the equally untenable theory that be an interference with liberty to offer reasonable help when private enterprise be in need of help the course have follow fit the american practice of government a practice of take action step by step of regulate only to meet concrete need a practice of courageous recognition of change believe with abraham|lincoln that the legitimate object of government be to do for a community of people whatever need to have do but can not do at all or can not do so well for in separate and individual capacity still believe in ideal be not for a return to that definition of liberty under which for many|years a free people be be gradually regiment into the service of the privileged few prefer and be sure prefer that broad definition of liberty under which be move forward to great freedom to great security for the average man than have ever know before in the history of america view transcript transcript have be several|month since have talk with concern the problem of government since january those of in whom have vest responsibility have be engage in the fulfillment of plan and policy which have be widely discuss in previous|month seem to duty not only to make the right path clear but also to tread that path as review the achievement of this session of the seventy third congress be make increasingly clear that task be essentially that of complete and fortify the work have begin in march,|1933 that be no easy task but the congress be equal to have be well say that while there be a few exception this congress display a great freedom from mere partisanship than any other peace time congress since the administration of president washington the session be distinguish by the extent and variety of legislation enact and by the intelligence and good will of debate upon these measure mention only a few of the major enactment provide for the readjustment of the debt burden through the corporate and municipal bankruptcy act and the farm relief act lend a hand to industry by encourage loan to solvent industry unable to secure adequate help from banking institution strengthen the integrity of finance through the regulation of security exchange provide a rational method of increase volume of foreign trade through reciprocal trading agreement strengthen naval force to conform with the intention and permission of exist treaty right make further advance towards peace in industry through the labor adjustment act supplement agricultural policy through measure widely demand by farmer and intend to avert price destroy surplus strengthen the hand of the|federal|government in attempt to suppress gangster crime take definite step towards a national housing program through an act which sign today design to encourage private capital in the rebuilding of the home of the nation create a permanent federal body for the just regulation of all form of communication include the telephone the telegraph and the radio finally and believe most important reorganize simplify and make more fair and just monetary system set up standard and policy adequate to meet the necessity of modern economic life do justice to both gold and silver as the metal basis behind the currency of the|united|state in the consistent development of previous effort toward the saving and safeguarding of national life have continue to recognize related step the first be relief because the primary concern of any government dominate by the humane ideal of democracy be the simple principle that in a land of vast resource no one should be permit to starve relief be and continue to be first consideration call for large expenditure and will continue in modify form to do so for a long time to come may as well recognize that fact come from the paralysis that arise as the after effect of that|unfortunate|decade characterize by a mad chase for unearned rich and an unwillingness of leader in almost every walk of life to look beyond own scheme and speculation in administration of relief follow principle first that direct giving shall wherever possible be supplement by provision for useful and remunerative work and second that where family in exist surrounding will in all human probability never find an opportunity for full self maintenance happiness and enjoyment will try to give a new chance in new surrounding the second step be recovery and be sufficient for to ask each and every of to compare the situation in agriculture and in industry today with what be fifteen|months|ago at the same time have recognize the necessity of reform and reconstruction because much of trouble today and in the|past|few|year have be due to a lack of understanding of the elementary principle of justice and fairness by those in whom leadership in business and finance be place reconstruction because new condition in economic life as well as old but neglected condition have to be correct substantial gain well know to all of have justify course could cite statistic to as unanswerable measure of national progress statistic to show the gain in the average weekly pay envelope of worker in the great majority of industry --statistic to show hundreds|of|thousands reemploye in private industry and other hundreds|of|thousands give new employment through the expansion of direct and indirect government assistance of many kind although of course there be those exception in professional pursuit whose economic improvement of necessity will be delay also could cite statistic to show the great rise in the value of farm product statistic to prove the demand for consumer ' good range all the way from food and clothing to automobile and of late to prove the rise in the demand for durable good statistic to cover the great increase in bank deposit and to show the score of thousand of home and of farm which have be save from foreclosure but the simple way for each of to judge recovery lie in the plain fact of own individual situation be well off than be last|year be debt less burdensome be bank account more secure be working condition better be faith in own individual future more firmly ground also let put to another simple question have as an individual pay too high a price for these gain plausible self seeker and theoretical die hard will tell of the loss of individual liberty answer this question also out of the fact of own life have lose any of right or liberty or constitutional freedom of action and choice turn to the|bill|of|rights|of|the|constitution which have solemnly swear to maintain and under which freedom rest secure read each provision of that bill|of|right and ask whether personally have suffer the impairment of a single jot of these great assurance have no question in mind as to what answer will be the record be write in the experience of own personal life in other word be not the overwhelming majority of the farmer or manufacturer or worker who deny the substantial gain of the|past|year the most vociferous of the doubt thomases may be divide roughly into group first those who seek special political privilege and second those who seek special financial privilege about|a|year|ago use as an illustration the|90|percent of the cotton manufacturer of the|united|state who want to do the right thing by employee and by the public but be prevent from do so by the who undercut by unfair practice and un - american standard be well for to remember that humanity be a long way from be perfect and that a selfish minority in every walk of life farming business finance and even government service will always continue to think of first and fellow be second in the working out of a great national program which seek the primary good of the great number be true that the toe of some people be be step on and be go to be step on but these toe belong to the comparative few who seek to retain or to gain position or rich or both by some short cut which be harmful to the great good in the execution of the power confer on by congress the administration need and will tirelessly seek the good ability that the country afford public service offer well reward in the opportunity for service than ever before in history not great salary but enough to live on in the building of this service there be come to man and woman with ability and courage from every part of the union the|day of the seeking of mere party advantage through the misuse of public power be draw to a close be increasingly demand and get devotion to the public service on the part of every member of the administration high and low the program of the|past|year be definitely in operation and that|operation|month by month be be make to fit into the web of old and new condition this process of evolution be well illustrate by the constant change in detailed organization and method go on in the|national|recovery|administration with every pass month be make stride in the orderly handling of the relationship between employee and employer condition differ of course in almost every part of the country and in almost every industry temporary method of adjustment be be replace by more permanent machinery and be glad to say by a grow recognition on the part of employer and employee of the desirability of maintain fair relationship all around so also while almost everybody have recognize the tremendous stride in the elimination of child labor in the payment of not less than fair minimum wage and in the|shortening|of|hour be still feel way in solve problem which relate to self government in industry especially where such self government tend to eliminate the fair operation of competition in this same process of evolution be keep before the objective of protect on the hand industry against chiseler within own rank and on the other hand the consumer through the maintenance of reasonable competition for the prevention of the unfair sky rocketing of retail price but in addition to this immediate task must still look to the large future have point out to the congress that be seek to find the way once more to well know long establish but to some degree forget ideal and value seek the security of the man woman and child of the nation that security involve add mean of provide well home for the people of the nation that be the first principle of future program the second be to plan the use of land and water resource of this country to the end that the mean of livelihood of citizen may be more adequate to meet daily need and finally the third principle be to use the agency of government to assist in the establishment of mean to provide sound and adequate protection against the vicissitude of modern life in other word social insurance later|in|the|year hope to talk with more fully about these plan a few timid people who fear progress will try to give new and strange name for what be do sometimes will call fascism sometimes communism sometimes regimentation sometimes socialism but in so do be try to make very complex and theoretical something that be really very simple and very practical believe in practical explanation and in practical policy believe that what be do today be a necessary fulfillment of what americans have always be do a fulfillment of old and test american ideal let give a simple illustration while be away from washington this|summer a long need renovation of and addition to white|house office building be to be start the architect have plan a few new room build into the present all too small story structure be go to include in this addition and in this renovation modern electric wiring and modern plumbing and modern mean of keep the office cool in the hot washington summer but the structural line of the old executive|office|building will remain the artistic line of the|white|house building be the creation of master builder when republic be young the simplicity and the strength of the structure remain in the face of every modern test but within this magnificent pattern the necessity of modern government business require constant reorganization and rebuilding if be to listen to the argument of some prophet of calamity who be talk these|day should hesitate to make these alteration should fear that while be away for a|few|week the architect may build some strange new gothic tower or a factory building or perhaps a replica of the kremlin or of the|potsdam|palace but have no such fear the architect and builder be man of common sense and of artistic american taste know that the principle of harmony and of necessity require that the building of the new structure shall blend with the essential line of the old be this combination of the old and the new that mark orderly peaceful progress not only in build building but in build government new structure be a part of and a fulfillment of the old all that do seek to fulfill the historic tradition of the american people other nation may sacrifice democracy for the transitory stimulation of old and discredited autocracy be restore confidence and well being under the rule of the people remain as john|marshall say a|century|ago emphatically and truly a government of the people government in form and in substance emanate from power be grant by and be to be exercise directly on and for benefit before close want to tell of the interest and pleasure with which look forward to the trip on which hope to start in a|few|day be a good thing for everyone who can possibly do so to get away at least once a year for a change of scene do not want to get into the position of not be able to see the forest because of the thickness of the tree hope to visit fellow americans in puerto|rico in in the|canal|zone and in hawaii and incidentally will give an opportunity to exchange a friendly word of greet to the president of sister republics haiti colombia and panama after four|weeks on board ship plan to land at a port in pacific northwest and then will come the good part of the whole trip for be hope to inspect a number of new great national project on the columbia missouri and mississippi|rivers to see some of national park and incidentally to learn much of actual condition during the trip across the continent back to washington while be in france during boy use to call god 's country let make and keep god 's country transcript be three|months since have talk with the people of this country about national problem but during this period many thing have happen and be glad to say that the major part of have greatly help the well being of the average citizen because in every step which government be take be think in term of the average of in the old word the great good to the great number as reasonable people can not expect to bring definite benefit to every person or to every occupation or business or industry or agriculture in the same way no reasonable person can expect that in this short space of time during which new machinery have to be not only put to work but first set up that every locality in every of the state of the country could share equally and simultaneously in the trend to well time the whole picture however the average of the whole territory from coast to coast the average of the whole population of people show to any person willing to look fact and action of which and can be proud in the|early|spring|of|this|year there be actually and proportionately more people out of work in this country than in any other nation in the world fair estimate show or unemployed last|march among those there be of course several|million who could be class as normally unemployed people who work occasionally when feel like and other who prefer not to work at all seem therefore fair to say that there be about|10|million of citizen who earnestly and in many case hungrily be seek work and could not get of these in the short space of a|few|month be convinced that at|least|4|million have be give employment or say another way of those seek work have find that do not mean friend that be satisfied or that be satisfied that work be end have a long way to go but be on the way how be construct the edifice of recovery the temple which when complete will no longer be a temple of money changer or of beggar but rather a temple dedicate to and maintain for a great social justice a great welfare for america the habitation of a sound economic life be build stone by stone the column which will support that habitation those column be many in number and though for a moment the progress of column may disturb the progress on the pillar next to the work on all of must proceed without let or hindrance all know that immediate relief for the unemployed be the first essential of such a structure and that be why speak first of the fact that three|hundred|thousand young man have be give employment and be be give employment all through this|winter in the|civilian|conservation|corps|camps in almost every part of the nation so too have as know expend great sum in cooperation with state and locality for work relief and home relief than ever before sum which during the|coming|winter can not be lessen for the very simple reason that though several|million people have go back to work the necessity of those who have not yet obtain work be more severe than at this time last|year then come to the relief that be be give to those who be in danger of lose farm or home new machinery have to be set up for farm credit and for home credit in every of the one|hundre county of the|united|state and every|day that pass be save home and farm to hundred of family have publicly ask that foreclosure on farm and chattel and on home be delay until every mortgagor in the country shall have have full opportunity to take advantage of federal credit make the further request which many of know have already be make through the great federal credit organization that if there be any family in the|united|state about to lose home or about to lose chattel that family should telegraph at once either to the|farm|credit|administration or the|home|owners|loan|corporation in washington request help other great agency be in full swing the|reconstruction|finance|corporation continue to lend large sum to industry and finance with the definite objective of make easy the extending of credit to industry commerce and finance the program of public work in three|months have advance to this point out of a total appropriate for public work of three|billion|three|hundred|million one|billion|eight|hundred|million have already be allocate to federal project of all kind and literally in every part of the|united|state and work on these be start forward in addition three|hundred|million have be allocate to public work to be carry out by state municipality and private organization such as those undertake slum clearance the balance of the public work money nearly all of intend for state or local project wait only on the presentation of proper project by the state and locality washington have the money and be wait for the proper project to which to allot another pillar in the making be the|agricultural|adjustment|administration have be amazed by the extraordinary degree of cooperation give to the government by the cotton farmer in the south the wheat farmer of the west the tobacco farmer of the southeast and be confident that the corn hog farmer of the|middle|west will come through in the same magnificent fashion the problem seek to solve have be steadily get bad for twenty|years but during the|last|six|month have make more rapid progress than any nation have ever make in a like period of time be true that in july farm commodity price have be push up higher than be today but that push come in part from pure speculation by people who could not tell the difference between wheat and rye by people who have never see cotton growing by people who do not know that hog be feed on corn people who have no real interest in the farmer and problem in spite however of the speculative reaction from the speculative advance seem to be well establish that during the course of the|year|1933 the farmer of the|united|state will receive more dollar for what have produce than receive in the|year|1932 put in another way will receive in where receive that remember be for the average of the country for have report that some section be not any well off than be a|year|ago this apply among the major product especially to cattle raise and the dairy industry be go after those problem as fast as can do not hesitate to say in the simple clear language of which be capable that although the price of many product of the farm have go up and although many farm family be well off than be last|year be not satisfied either with the amount or the extent of the rise and that be definitely a part of policy to increase the rise and to extend to those product which have as yet feel no benefit if can not do this way will do another do will stand beside the pillar of the farm the a.a.a. be the pillar of industry n.r.a. object be to put industry and business worker into employment and to increase purchasing power through increase wage have abolish child labor have eliminate the sweat shop have end sixty|cent a week pay in some mill and eighty|cent a week pay in some mine the measure of the growth of this pillar lie in the total figure of reemployment which have already give and in the fact that reemployment be continue and not stop the secret of n.r.a. be cooperation that cooperation have be voluntarily give through the signing of the blanket code and through the signing of specific code which already include all of the great industry of the nation in the vast majority of case in the vast majority of locality the n.r.a. have be give support in unstinted measure know that there be chiseler at the bottom of every case of criticism and obstruction have find some selfish interest some private axe to grind ninety|percent of complaint come from misconception for example have be say that n.r.a. have fail to raise the price of wheat and corn and hog that n.r.a. have not loan enough money for local public work of course n.r.a. have nothing whatsoever to do with the price of farm product nor with public work have to do only with industrial organization for economic planning to wipe out unfair practice and to create reemployment even in the field of business and industry n.|r.|a. do not apply to the rural community or to town of under five|hundred population except in so far as those town contain factory or chain store which come under a specific code be also true that among the chiseler to whom have refer there be not only the big chiseler but also petty chiseler who seek to make undue profit on untrue statement let cite to the example of the salesman in a store in a large eastern city who try to justify the increase in the price of a cotton shirt from one|dollar and a half to dollar and a half by say to the customer that be due to the cotton processing tax actually in that shirt there be about pound of cotton and the processing tax amount to four|and a quarter cent on that pound of cotton at this point be only fair that should give credit to the sixty|or|seventy|million people who live in the city and large town of the nation for understanding and willingness to go along with the payment of even these small processing taxis though know full well that the proportion of the processing taxis on cotton good and on food product pay for by city dweller go one|hundred|per|cent towards increase the agricultural income of the farm dweller of the land the last pillar of which speak be that of the money of the country in the bank of the country there be simple fact first the|federal|government be about to spend one|billion|dollars as an immediate loan on the frozen or non - liquid asset of all bank close since january|1,|1933 give a liberal appraisal to those asset this money will be in the hand of the depositor as quickly as be humanly possible to get out secondly the government|bank|deposit|insurance on all account up|to|$2500 go into effect on january|first be now engage in see to that on or before that date the banking capital structure will be build up by the government to the point that the bank will be in sound condition when the insurance go into effect finally repeat what have say on many occasion that ever since last|march the definite policy of the government have be to restore commodity price level the object have be the attainment of such a level as will enable agriculture and industry once more to give work to the unemployed have be to make possible the payment of public and private debt more nearly at the price level at which be incur have be gradually to restore a balance in the price structure so that farmer may exchange product for the product of industry on a fair exchange basis have be and be also the purpose to prevent price from rise beyond the point necessary to attain these end the permanent welfare and security of every class of people ultimately depend on attainment of these purpose obviously and because hundred of different kind of crop and industrial occupation in the huge territory that make up this nation be involve can not reach the goal in only|a|few|months may take one|year|or|two|years|or|three|year no one who consider the plain fact of situation believe that commodity price especially agricultural price be high enough yet some people be put the cart before the horse want a permanent revaluation of the dollar first be the government 's policy to restore the price level first would not know and no one else could tell just what the permanent valuation of the dollar will be to guess at a permanent gold valuation now would certainly require later change cause by later fact when have restore the price level shall seek to establish and maintain a dollar which will not change purchasing and debt pay power during the succeed generation say that in message to the american delegation in london last|july and say now once more because of condition in this country and because of event beyond control in other part of the world become increasingly important to develop and apply the further measure which may be necessary from time to time to control the gold value of own dollar at home dollar be now altogether too greatly influence by the accident of international trade by the internal policy of other nation and by political disturbance in other continent therefore the|united|states must take firmly in own hand the control of the gold value of dollar this be necessary in order to prevent dollar disturbance from swinge away from ultimate goal namely the continued recovery of commodity price as a further effective mean to this end be go to establish a government market for gold in the|united|state therefore under the clearly define authority of exist law be authorize the|reconstruction|finance|corporation to buy gold newly mine in the|united|state at price to be determine from time to time after consultation with the secretary of the treasury and the president whenever necessary to the end in view shall also buy or sell gold in the world market aim in take this step be to establish and maintain continuous control this be a policy and not an expedient be not to be use merely to offset a temporary fall in price be thus continue to move towards a manage currency will recall the dire prediction make last|spring by those who do not agree with common policy of raise price by direct mean what actually happen stand out in sharp contrast with those prediction government credit be high price have rise in part doubtless prophet of evil still exist in midst but government credit will be maintain and a sound currency will accompany a rise in the american commodity price level have tell tonight the story of steady but sure work in build common recovery in promise to both before and after march|4th make thing plain first that pledge no miracle and second that would do good thank for patience and faith trouble will not be over tomorrow but be on way and be head in the right direction transcript after the adjournment of the historical special session of the congress five|weeks|ago purposely refrain from address for very good reason first think that all want the opportunity of a little quiet thought to examine and assimilate in a mental picture the crowd event of the|hundred|days which have be devote to the starting of the wheel of the new deal secondly want a|few|weeks in which to set up the new administrative organization and to see the first fruit of careful planning think will interest if set forth the fundamental of this planning for national recovery and this be very certain will make abundantly clear to that all of the proposal and all of the legislation since the|fourth|day|of|march have not be just a collection of haphazard scheme but rather the orderly component part of a connected and logical whole long before inauguration|day become convinced that individual effort and local effort and even disjoint federal effort have fail and of necessity would fail and therefore that a rounded leadership by the|federal|government have become a necessity both of theory and of fact such leadership however have beginning in preserve and strengthen the credit of the|united|states|government because without that no leadership be a possibility for year the government have not live within income the immediate task be to bring regular expense within revenue that have be do may seem inconsistent for a government to cut down regular expense and at the same time to borrow and to spend billion for an emergency but be not inconsistent because a large portion of the emergency money have be pay out in the form of sound loan which will be repay to the treasury over a|period|of|years and to cover the rest of the emergency money have impose taxis to pay the interest and the installment on that part of the debt so will see that have keep credit good have build a granite foundation in a period of confusion that foundation of the federal credit stand there broad and sure be the base of the whole recovery plan then come the part of the problem that concern the credit of the individual citizen and know of the banking crisis and of the great danger to the saving of people on march|sixth every national bank be closed one|month|later of the deposit in the national bank have be make available to the depositor today only|about per cent of the deposit in national bank be still tie up the condition relate to state bank while not quite so good on a percentage basis be shove a steady reduction in the total of frozen deposit a result much better than have expect the problem of the credit of the individual be make more difficult because of another fact the dollar be a different dollar from the one with which the average debt have be incur for this reason large number of people be actually lose possession of and title to farm and home all of know the financial step which have be take to correct this inequality in addition the|farm|loan|act and the|bankruptcy|act be pass be a vital necessity to restore purchase power by reduce the debt and interest charge upon people but while be help people to save credit be at the same time absolutely essential to do something about the physical need of hundreds|of|thousand who be in dire strait at that very moment municipal and state aid be be stretch to the limit appropriate half|a|billion|dollar to supplement effort and in addition as know have put young man into practical and useful work in forest and to prevent flood and soil erosion the wage earn be go in great part to the support of the nearly|one|million people who constitute family in this same classification can properly place the great public work program run to a total of over|three|billion|dollars to be use for highway and ship and flood prevention and inland navigation and thousand of self sustain state and municipal improvement point should be make clear in the allotting and administration of these project first be use the utmost care to choose labor create quick act useful project avoid the smell of the pork barrel and secondly be hope that at|least|half of the money will come back to the government from project which will pay for over a|period|of|year thus far have speak primarily of the foundation stone the measure that be necessary to re - establish credit and to head people in the opposite direction by prevent distress and provide as much work as possible through governmental agency now come to the link which will build a more lasting prosperity have say that can not attain that in a nation half boom and half break if all of people have work and fair wage and fair profit can buy the product of neighbor and business be good but if take away the wage and the profit of half of business be only|half as good do not help much if the fortunate half be very prosperous the good way be for everybody to be reasonably prosperous for many|year the great barrier to a normal prosperity have be low farm price and the creep paralysis of unemployment these factor have cut the purchasing power of the country in half promise action congress do part when pass the farm and the industrial recovery act today be put these act to work and will work if people understand plain objective first be base on the fact that the purchasing power of nearly|half population depend on adequate price for farm product have be produce more of some crop than consume or can sell in a depressed world market the cure be not to produce so much without help the farmer can not get together and cut production and the farm|bill give a method of bring production down to a reasonable level and of obtain reasonable price for crop have clearly state that this method be in a sense experimental but so far as have go have reason to believe that will produce good result be obvious that if can greatly increase the purchasing power of the|tens|of|million of people who make a living from farming and the distribution of farm crop will greatly increase the consumption of those good which be turn out by industry that bring to the final step bring back industry along sound line last|autumn on several occasion express faith that can make possible by democratic self discipline in industry general increase in wage and shortening of hour sufficient to enable industry to pay own worker enough to let those worker buy and use the thing that labor produce this can be do only if permit and encourage cooperative action in industry because be obvious that without united action a few selfish man in each competitive group will pay starvation wage and insist on long|hour of work other in that group must either follow suit or close up shop have see the result of action of that kind in the continue descent into the economic hell of there be a clear way to reverse that process if all employer in each competitive group agree to pay worker the same wage reasonable wage and require the|same|hours reasonable hour then high wage and short hour will hurt no employer moreover such action be well for the employer than unemployment and low wage because make more buyer for product that be the simple idea which be the very heart of the|industrial|recovery|act on the basis of this simple principle of everybody do thing together be start out on this nationwide attack on unemployment will succeed if people understand in the big industry in the little shop in the great city and in the small village there be nothing complicate about and there be nothing particularly new in the principle go back to the basic idea of society and of the nation that people act in a group can accomplish thing which no individual act alone could even hope to bring about here be an example in the|cotton|textile|code and in other agreement already sign child labor have be abolish that make personally happy than any other thing with which have be connect since come to washington in the textile industry an industry which come to spontaneously and with a splendid cooperation as soon as the recovery act be sign child labor be an old evil but no employer act alone be able to wipe out if employer try or if state try the cost of operation rise so high that be impossible to compete with the employer or state which have fail to act the moment be pass this monstrous thing which neither opinion nor law could reach through year of effort go out in a flash as a british editorial put do more under a code in than in england have be able to do under the common law in five|year of effort use this incident friend not to boast of what have already be do but to point the way to for even great cooperative effort this summer and autumn be not go through another winter like the last doubt if ever any people so bravely and cheerfully endure a season half so bitter can not ask america to continue to face such needless hardship be time for courageous action and the recovery bill give the mean to conquer unemployment with exactly the same weapon that have use to strike down child|labor the proposition be simply this if all employer will act together to shorten hour and raise wage can put people back to work no employer will suffer because the relative level of competitive cost will advance by the same amount for all but if any considerable group should lag or shirk this great opportunity will pass by and will go into another desperate winter this must not happen have send out to all employer an agreement which be the result of week of consultation this agreement check against the voluntary code of nearly all the large industry which have already be submit this blanket agreement carry the unanimous approval of the board which have appoint to advise in this board represent the great leader in labor in industry and in social service the agreement have already bring a flood of approval from every state and from so wide a cross - section of the common calling of industry that know be fair for all be a plan reasonable and just intend to put into effect at once the most important of the broad principle which be be establish industry by industry through code naturally take a good deal of organizing and a great many hearing and many|months to get these code perfect and sign and can not wait for all of to go through the blanket agreement however which be send to every employer will start the wheel turn now and not six|months|from|now there be of course man a few of who may thwart this great common purpose by seek selfish advantage there be adequate penalty in the law but be now ask the cooperation that come from opinion and from conscience these be the only instrument shall use in this great summer offensive against unemployment but shall use to the limit to protect the willing from the laggard and to make the plan succeed in war in the gloom of night attack soldier wear a bright badge on shoulder to be sure that comrade do not fire on comrade on that principle those who cooperate in this program must know each other at a glance that be why have provide a badge of honor for this purpose a simple design with a legend do part and ask that all those who join with shall display that badge prominently be essential to purpose already all the great basic industry have come forward willingly with propose code and in these code accept the principle lead to mass reemployment but important as be this hearten demonstration the rich field for result be among the small employer those whose contribution will give new work for from to people these small employer be indeed a vital part of the backbone of the country and the success of plan lie largely in hand already the telegram and letter be pour into the|white|house --message from employer who ask that name be place on this special roll|of|honor represent great corporation and company and partnership and individual ask that even before the date set in the agreement which have send out the employer of the country who have not already do so the big fellow and the little fellow shall at once write or telegraph to personally at the|white|house express intention of go through with the plan and be purpose to keep post in the post office of every town a|roll|of|honor of all those who join with want to take this occasion to say to the governor who be now in conference in san|francisco that nothing thus far have help in strengthen this great movement more than resolution adopt at the very outset of meeting give this plan instant and unanimous approval and pledge to support in state to the man and woman whose life have be darken by the fact or the fear of unemployment be justify in say a word of encouragement because the code and the agreement already approve or about to be pass upon prove that the plan do raise wage and that do put people back to work can look on every employer who adopt the plan as who be do part and those employer deserve well of everyone who work for a living will be clear to as be to that while the shirk employer may undersell competitor the saving thus make be make at the expense of country 's welfare while be make this great common effort there should be no discord and dispute this be no time to cavil or to question the standard set by this universal agreement be time for patience and understanding and cooperation the worker of this country have right under this law which can not be take from and nobody will be permit to whittle away but on the other hand no aggression be now necessary to attain those right the whole country will be unite to get for the principle that apply to the employer apply to the worker as well and ask worker to cooperate in the same spirit when andrew|jackson die someone ask will go to heaven and the answer be will if want to if be ask whether the american people will pull out of this depression answer will if want to the essence of the plan be a universal limitation of hour of work per week for any individual by common consent and a universal payment of wage above a minimum also by common consent can not guarantee the success of this nationwide plan but the people of this country can guarantee success have no faith in cure all but believe that can greatly influence economic force have no sympathy with the professional economist who insist that thing must run course and that human agency can have no influence on economic ill reason be that happen to know that professional economist have change definition of economic law every|five|or|ten|year for a very long time but do have faith and retain faith in the strength of common purpose and in the strength of unified action take by the american people that be why be describe to the simple purpose and the solid foundation upon which program of recovery be build that be why be ask the employer of the nation to sign this common covenant with to sign in the name of patriotism and humanity that be why be ask the worker to go along with in a spirit of understanding and of helpfulness transcript on a sunday night a week after inauguration use the radio to tell about the banking crisis and the measure be take to meet think that in that way make clear to the country various fact that may otherwise have be misunderstood and in general provide a means of understanding which do much to restore confidence tonight eight|weeks|later come for the second time to give report in the same spirit and by the same mean to tell about what have be do and what be plan to do two|months|ago be face serious problem the country be die by inch be die because trade and commerce have decline to dangerously low level price for basic commodity be such as to destroy the value of the asset of national institution such as bank saving bank insurance company and other these institution because of great need be foreclose mortgage call loan refuse credit thus there be actually in process of destruction the property of million of people who have borrow money on that property in term of dollar which have have an entirely different value from the level of march,|1933 that situation in that crisis do not call for any complicated consideration of economic panacea or fancy plan be face by a condition and not a theory there be just alternative the first be to allow the foreclosure to continue credit to be withhold and money to go into hiding and thus force liquidation and bankruptcy of bank railroad and insurance company and a recapitalizing of all business and all property on a low level this alternative mean a continuation of what be loosely call deflation the net result of which would have be extraordinary hardship on all property owner and incidentally extraordinary hardship on all person work for wage through an increase in unemployment and a further reduction of the wage scale be easy to see that the result of this course would have not only economic effect of a very serious nature but social result that may bring incalculable harm even before be inaugurate come to the conclusion that such a policy be too much to ask the american people to bear involve not only a further loss of home farm saving and wage but also a loss of spiritual value the loss of that sense of security for the present and the future so necessary to the peace and contentment of the individual and of family when destroy these thing will find difficult to establish confidence of any sort in the future be clear that mere appeal from washington for confidence and the mere lending of more money to shaky institution could not stop this downward course a prompt program apply as quickly as possible seem to not only justified but imperative to national security the congress and when say congress mean the member of both political party fully understand this and give generous and intelligent support the member of congress realize that the method of normal time have to be replace in the emergency by measure which be suit to the serious and press requirement of the moment there be no actual surrender of power congress still retain constitutional authority and no one have the slight desire to change the balance of these power the function of congress be to decide what have to be do and to select the appropriate agency to carry out will this policy have strictly adhere to the only thing that have be happen have be to designate the president as the agency to carry out certain of the purpose of the congress this be constitutional and in keep with the past american tradition the legislation which have be pass or in the process of enactment can properly be consider as part of a well ground plan first be give opportunity of employment to quarter of a of the unemployed especially the young man who have dependent to go into the forestry and flood prevention work this be a big task because mean feed clothing and care for nearly twice as many man as have in the regular army in create this civilian conservation corps be kill bird with stone be clearly enhance the value of natural resource and second be relieve an appreciable amount of actual distress this great group of man have enter upon work on a purely voluntary basis no military training be involve and be conserve not only natural resource but human resource of the great value to this work be the fact that be direct and require the intervention of very little machinery second have request the congress and have secure action upon a proposal to put the great property own by government|at|muscle|shoal to work after long year of wasteful inaction and with this a broad plan for the improvement of a vast area in the|tennessee|valley will add to the comfort and happiness of hundreds|of|thousands of people and the incident benefit will reach the entire nation next the congress be about to pass legislation that will greatly ease the mortgage distress among the farmer and the home owner of the nation by provide for the easing of the burden of debt now bear so heavily upon million of people next step in seek immediate relief be a grant of half|a|billion|dollar to help the state county and municipality in duty to care for those who need direct and immediate relief the congress also pass legislation authorize the sale of beer in such state as desire this have already result in considerable reemployment and incidentally have provide much need tax revenue be plan to ask the congress for legislation to enable the government to undertake public work thus stimulate directly and indirectly the employment of many other in well consider project further legislation have be take up which go much more fundamentally into economic problem the farm relief bill seek by the use of several method alone or together to bring about an increase return to farmer for major farm product seek at the same time to prevent in the|day to come disastrous over production which so often in the past have keep farm commodity price far below a reasonable return this measure provide wide power for emergency the extent of use will depend entirely upon what the future have in store well consider and conservative measure will likewise be propose which will attempt to give to the industrial worker of the country a more fair wage return prevent cut throat competition and unduly|long|hours for labor and at the same time to encourage each industry to prevent over production railroad bill fall into the same class because seek to provide and make certain definite planning by the railroad with the assistance of the government to eliminate the duplication and waste that be now result in railroad receivership and continue operate deficit be certain that the people of this country understand and approve the broad purpose behind these new governmental policy relate to agriculture and industry and transportation find face with more agricultural product than could possibly consume and surplus which other nation do not have the cash to buy from except at price ruinously low have find factory able to turn out more good than could possibly consume and at the same time be face with a fall export demand find with more facility to transport good and crop than there be good and crop to be transport all of this have be cause in large part by a complete lack of planning and a complete failure to understand the danger signal that have be fly ever since the close of the|world|war the people of this country have be erroneously encourage to believe that could keep on increase the output of farm and factory indefinitely and that some magician would find way and mean for that increase output to be consume with reasonable profit to the producer today have reason to believe that thing be a little well than be two|months|ago industry have pick up railroad be carry more freight farm price be well but be not go to indulge in issue proclamation of over enthusiastic assurance can not bally ho back to prosperity be go to be honest at all time with the people of the country do not want the people of this country to take the foolish course of let this improvement come back on another speculative wave do not want the people to believe that because of unjustified optimism can resume the ruinous practice of increase crop output and factory output in the hope that a kind providence will find buyer at high price such a course may bring immediate and false prosperity but will be the kind of prosperity that will lead into another tailspin be wholly wrong to call the measure that have take government control of farming control of industry and control of transportation be rather a partnership between government and farming and industry and transportation not partnership in profit for the profit would still go to the citizen but rather a partnership in planning and partnership to see that the plan be carry out let illustrate with an example take the cotton good industry be probably true that ninety|per|cent of the cotton manufacturer would agree to eliminate starvation wage would agree to stop|long|hours of employment would agree to stop child labor would agree to prevent an overproduction that would result in unsalable surplus but what good be such an agreement if the other per cent of cotton manufacturer pay starvation wage require long|hours employ child in mill and turn out burdensome surplus the unfair ten|per|cent could produce good so cheaply that the fair ninety|per|cent would be compel to meet the unfair condition here be where government come in government ought to have the right and will have the right after surveying and planning for an industry to prevent with the assistance of the overwhelming majority of that industry unfair practice and to enforce this agreement by the authority of government the so call anti - trust law be intend to prevent the creation of monopoly and to forbid unreasonable profit to those monopoly that purpose of the anti - trust law must be continue but these law be never intend to encourage the kind of unfair competition that result in long|hours starvation wage and overproduction the same principle apply to farm product and to transportation and every other field of organize private industry be work toward a definite goal which be to prevent the return of condition which come very close to destroy what call modern civilization the actual accomplishment of purpose can not be attain in a|day policy be wholly within purpose for which american|constitutional|government be establish know that the people of this country will understand this and will also understand the spirit in which be undertake this policy do not deny that may make mistake of procedure as carry out the policy have no expectation of make a hit every time come to bat what seek be the high possible batting average not only for but for the team once say to if can be right|75|percent of the time shall come up to the full measure of hope much have be say of late about federal finance and inflation the gold standard let make the fact very simple and policy very clear in the first place government credit and government currency be really and the same thing behind government bond there be only a promise to pay behind government currency have in addition to the promise to pay a reserve of gold and a small reserve of silver in this connection be worth while remember that in the past the government have agree to redeem nearly billion of debt and currency in gold and private corporation in this country have agree to redeem another sixty or seventy|billion of security and mortgage in gold the government and private corporation be make these agreement when know full well that all of the gold in the|united|state amount to only between three|and|four|billions and that all of the gold in all of the world amount to only about billion if the holder of these promise to pay start in to demand gold the first comer would get gold for a|few|day and would amount to about|one fifth of the holder of the security and the currency the other people out of who do not happen to be at the top of the line would be tell politely that there be no more gold left have decide to treat all|twenty in the same way in the interest of justice and the exercise of the constitutional power of this government have place every one on the same basis in order that the general good may be preserve nevertheless gold and to a partial extent silver be perfectly good basis for currency and that be why decide not to let any of the gold now in the country go out of a series of condition arise which very readily may have mean first a drain on gold by foreign country and secondly as a result of that a flight of american capital in the form of gold out of country be not exaggerate the possibility to tell that such an occurrence may well have take from the major part of gold reserve and result in such a further weakening of government and private credit as to bring on actual panic condition and the complete stoppage of the wheel of industry the administration have the definite objective of raise commodity price to such an extent that those who have borrow money will on the average be able to repay that money in the same kind of dollar which borrow do not seek to let get such a cheap dollar that will be able to pay bock a great deal less than borrow in other word seek to correct a wrong and not to create another wrong in the opposite direction that be why power be be give to the administration to provide if necessary for an enlargement of credit in order to correct the exist wrong these power will be use when as and if may be necessary to accomplish the purpose hand in hand with the domestic situation which of course be first concern be the world situation and want to emphasize to that the domestic situation be inevitably and deeply tie in with the condition in all of the other nation of the world in other word can get in all probability a fair measure of prosperity return in the|united|state but will not be permanent unless get a return to prosperity all over the world in the conference which have hold and be hold with the leader of other nation be seek great objective first a general reduction of armament and through this the removal of the fear of invasion and armed attack and at the same time a reduction in armament cost in order to help in the balancing of government budget and the reduction of taxation secondly a cutting down of the trade barrier in order to re - start the flow of exchange of crop and good between nation third the setting up of a stabilization of currency in order that trade can make contract ahead fourth the reestablishment of friendly relation and great confidence between all nation foreign visitor these|past|three|week have respond to these purpose in a very helpful way all of the nations have suffer alike in this great depression have all reach the conclusion that each can best be help by the common action of all be in this spirit that visitor have meet with and discuss common problem the international conference that lie before must succeed the future of the world demand and have each of pledge to the good joint effort to this end to the people of this country all of the member of the congress and the member of this administration owe a profound debt of gratitude throughout the depression have be patient have grant wide power have encourage with a wide spread approval of purpose every ounce of strength and every resource at command have devote to the end of justify confidence be encourage to believe that a wise and sensible beginning have be make in the present spirit of mutual confidence and mutual encouragement go forward view transcript transcript want to talk for a|few|minute with the people of the|united|state about banking with the comparatively few who understand the mechanic of banking but more particularly with the overwhelming majority who use bank for the making of deposit and the drawing of check want to tell what have be do in the|last|few|day why be do and what the next step be go to be recognize that the many proclamation from and from washington the legislation the treasury regulation couch for the most part in banking and legal term should be explain for the benefit of the average citizen owe this in particular because of the fortitude and good temper with which everybody have accept the inconvenience and hardship of the|banking|holiday know that when understand what in washington have be about shall continue to have cooperation as fully as have have sympathy and help during the|past|week first of all let state the simple fact that when deposit money in a bank the bank do not put the money into a safe deposit vault invest money in many different form of credit bond commercial paper mortgage and many other kind of loan in other word the bank put money to work to keep the wheel of industry and of agriculture turn around a comparatively small part of the money put into the bank be keep in currency an amount which in normal time be wholly sufficient to cover the cash need of the average citizen in other word the total amount of all the currency in the country be only a small fraction of the total deposit in all of the bank what then happen during the|last|few|days|of|february and the|first|few|days|of|march because of undermined confidence on the part of the public there be a general rush by a large portion of population to turn bank deposit into currency or gold a rush so great that the sound bank could not get enough currency to meet the demand the reason for this be that on the spur of the moment be of course impossible to sell perfectly sound asset of a bank and convert into cash except at panic price far below real value by the|afternoon|of|march|3 scarcely a bank in the country be open to do business proclamation temporarily close in whole or in part have be issue by the governors in almost all the state be then that issue the proclamation provide for the nation wide bank holiday and this be the first step in the government 's reconstruction of financial and economic fabric the second step be the legislation promptly and patriotically pass by the congress confirm proclamation and broaden power so that become possible in view of the requirement of time to entend sic the holiday and lift the ban of that holiday gradually this law also give authority to develop a program of rehabilitation of banking facility want to tell citizen in every part of the nation that the national congress republicans and democrats alike show by this action a devotion to public welfare and a realization of the emergency and the necessity for speed that be difficult to match in history the third stage have be the series of regulation permit the bank to continue function to take care of the distribution of food and household necessity and the payment of payroll this bank holiday while result in many case in great inconvenience be afford the opportunity to supply the currency necessary to meet the situation no sound bank be a dollar bad off than be when close door last|monday neither be any bank which may turn out not to be in a position for immediate opening the new law allow the federal|reserve bank to issue additional currency on good asset and thus the bank that reopen will be able to meet every legitimate call the new currency be be send out by the|bureau|of|engraving|and|print in large volume to every part of the country be sound currency because be back by actual good asset a question will ask be this why be all the bank not to be reopen at the same time the answer be simple government do not intend that the history of the|past|few|year shall be repeat we do not want and will not have another epidemic of bank failure as a result start with the opening of bank in the federal|reserve|bank city those bank which on first examination by the treasury have already be find to be all right this will be follow on tuesday by the resumption of all function by bank already find to be sound in city where there be recognize clearinghouse that mean about|250 city of the|united|state on wednesday and succeed day bank in small place all through the country will resume business subject of course to the government 's physical ability to complete survey be necessary that the reopening of bank be extend over a period in order to permit the bank to make application for necessary loan to obtain currency need to meet requirement and to enable the government to make common sense checkup let make clear to that if bank do not open the|first|day be by no means justify in believe that will not open a bank that open on of the|subsequent|days be in exactly the same status as the bank that open tomorrow know that many people be worry about state bank not member of the|federal|reserve|system these bank can and will receive assistance from member bank and from the|reconstruction|finance|corporation these state bank be follow the same course as the national bank except that get license to resume business from the state authority and these authority have be ask by the secretary of the treasury to permit good bank to open up on the same schedule as the national bank be confident that the state banking department will be as careful as the|national|government in the policy relate to the opening of bank and will follow the same broad policy be possible that when the bank resume a very few people who have not recover from fear may again begin withdrawal let make clear that the bank will take care of all need and be belief that hoard during the|past|week have become an exceedingly unfashionable pastime need no prophet to tell that when the people find that can get money that can get when want for all legitimate purpose the phantom of fear will soon be lay people will again be glad to have money where will be safely take care of and where can use conveniently at any time can assure that be safe to keep money in a reopen bank than under the mattress the success of whole great national program depend of course upon the cooperation of the public on intelligent support and use of a reliable system remember that the essential accomplishment of the new legislation be that make possible for bank more readily to convert asset into cash than be the case before more liberal provision have be make for bank to borrow on these asset at the|reserve|bank and more liberal provision have also be make for issue currency on the security of those good asset this currency be not fiat currency be issue only on adequate security and every good bank have an abundance of such security more point before close there will be of course some bank unable to reopen without be reorganize the new law allow the government to assist in make these reorganization quickly and effectively and even allow the government to subscribe to at least a part of new capital which may be require hope can see from this elemental recital of what government be do that there be nothing complex or radical in the process have a bad banking situation some of banker have show either incompetent or dishonest in handling of the people 's fund have use the money entrust to in speculation and unwise loan this be of course not true in the vast majority of bank but be true in enough of to shock the people for a time into a sense of insecurity and to put into a frame of mind

the result of the agency have create and the policy have pursue have be to buttress whole domestic financial structure and greatly to restore credit facility but progress in recovery require another element as well that be fully restore confidence in the future institution and man may have resource and credit but unless have confidence progress be halting and insecure there be definite direction in which action by the government at once can contribute to strengthen further the force of recovery by strengthening of confidence be the necessary foundation to any other action and accomplishment would at once promote employment and increase price the first of these direction of action be the continue reduction of all government expenditure whether national state or local the difficulty of the country demand undiminishe effort toward economy in government in every direction embrace in this problem be the unquestioned balancing of that be the first necessity of national stability and be the foundation of further recovery must be balance in an absolutely safe and sure manner if full confidence be to be inspire the second direction for action be the complete reorganization at once of banking system the shock to economic life have undoubtedly be multiply by the weakness of this system and until be remedie recovery will be greatly hamper the third direction for immediate action be vigorous and whole souled cooperation with other government in the economic field that major difficulty find origin in the economic weakness of foreign nation require no demonstration the first need to day be strengthen of commodity price that can not be permanently accomplish by artificiality must be accomplish by expansion in consumption of good through the return of stability and confidence in the world at large and that in turn can not be fully accomplish without cooperation with other nation balance the budget shall in due course present the|executive|budget to the congress will show propose reduction in appropriation below those enact by the last session of the congress by over|$830,000,000 in addition shall present the necessary executive order under the recent act authorize the reorganization of the|federal|government which if permit to go into force will produce still further substantial economy these sum in reduction of appropriation will however be partially offset by an increase of about|$250,000,000 in uncontrollable item such as increase debt service in the budget there be include only the completion of the federal public work project already undertake or under contract speed up of federal public work during as an aid to employment have advance many type of such improvement to the point where further expansion can not be justify in usefulness to the government or the people as an aid to unemployment should beyond the normal constructive program substitute reproductive or so call self liquidate work loan for such purpose have be provide for through the|reconstruction|finance|corporation this change in character of project directly relieve the taxpayer and be capable of expansion into a large field than the direct federal work the reproductive work constitute an addition to national wealth and to future employment whereas further undue expansion of federal public work be but a burden upon the future the federal construction program thus limit to commitment and work in progress under the propose appropriation contemplate expenditure for the|next|fiscal|year include naval and other vessel construction as well as other form of public work and maintenance of a total of as compare with for the|present|year the expenditure on such item over the|four|years|ending|june|30 next will amount to or an amount of construction work time as great as the cost of the|panama|canal and except for completion of certain long view project place the nation in many direction well ahead of requirement for some|year to come a normal program of about|$200,000,000 per annum should hereafter provide for the country 's necessity and will permit substantial future reduction in federal expenditure recommend that the furlough system instal last|year be continue not only because of the economy produce but because be tantamount to the set an example which should be follow by the country and because embrace within working the spread work principle and thus serve to maintain a number of public servant who would otherwise be deprive of all income feel however in view of the present economic situation and the decrease in the cost of live by over that some further sacrifice should be make by salaried official of the government over and above the per cent reduction under the furlough system will recommend that after exempt the first of salary there should be a temporary reduction for one|year of of that part of all government salary in excess of the exemption the result of which combine with the furlough system will average reduction in pay to those earn more|than|$1,000 will recommend measure to eliminate certain payment in the veteran ' service conceive these outlay be entirely beyond the original intention of congress in build up veteran ' allowance many abuse have grow up from ill consider legislation should be eliminate the nation should not ask for a reduction in allowance to man and dependent whose disability rise out of war service nor to those veteran with substantial service who have become totally disabled from non - war connect cause and who be at the same time without other support these latter veteran be a charge on the community at some point and feel that in view of service to the nation as a whole the responsibility should fall upon many of the economy recommend in the budget be present at the last session of the congress but fail of adoption if the|economy|and|appropriations|committee of the congress in canvass these propose expenditure shall find further reduction which can be make without impair essential government service will be welcome both by the country and by but under no circumstance do feel that the congress should fail to uphold the total of reduction recommend some of the old revenue and some of the revenue provide under the act pass during the last session of the congress particularly those generally refer to as the nuisance taxis have not be as prolific of income as have be hope further revenue be necessary in addition to the amount of reduction in expenditure recommend many of the manufacturer ' excise taxis upon select industry not only fail to produce satisfactory revenue but be in many way unjust and discriminatory the time have come when if the government be to have an adequate basis of revenue to assure a balanced budget this system of special manufacturer ' excise taxis should be extend to cover practically all manufacture at a uniform rate except necessary food and possibly some grade of clothing at the last session the congress respond to request for authority to reorganize the government department the act provide for the grouping and consolidation of executive and administrative agency accord to major purpose and thereby reduce the number and overlap and duplication of effort executive order issue for these purpose be require to be transmit to the congress while in session and do not become effective until after the expiration of after such transmission unless the congress shall sooner approve shall issue such executive order within a|few|day group or consolidate over executive and administrative agency include a large number of commission and independent agency the second step of course remain that after these various bureaus and agency be place cheek by jowl into such group the administrative officer in charge of the group shall eliminate overlap and still further consolidate these activity therein lie large economy the congress must be warn that a host of interested person inside and outside the government whose vision be concentrate on some particular function will at once protest against these proposal these same sort of activity have prevent reorganization of the government for over a quarter of a century must be disregard if the task be to be accomplish banking the basis of every other and every further effort toward recovery be to reorganize at once banking system the shock to economic system have undoubtedly multiply by the weakness of financial system first call attention of the congress in to this condition and have unceasingly recommend remedy since that time the subject have be exhaustively investigate both by the committee of the congress and the officer of the|federal|reserve|system the banking and financial system be presume to serve in furnish the essential lubricant to the wheel of industry agriculture and commerce that is credit diversion from proper use improper use or insufficiency instantly bring hardship and dislocation in economic life as a system banking have fail to meet this great emergency can be say without question of doubt that loss and distress have be greatly augment by wholly inadequate organization inability as a system to respond to need be to day a constant drain upon progress toward recovery in this statement be not refer to individual bank or banker thousand of have show distinguished courage and ability on the contrary be refer to the system which be so organized or so lack in organization that in an emergency very mechanism jeopardize or paralyze the action of sound bank and instability be responsible for periodic danger to whole economic system bank failure rise in to per cent of all the bank as compare to per cent of the failure of all other type of enterprise since january|1,|1930 have have bank suspend with in deposit partly from fear and drain from abroad partly from these failure which indeed often cause closing of sound bank have witness hoarding of currency to an enormous sum rise during the height of the crisis to over the result from interreaction of cause and effect have express in strangulation of credit which at time have almost stifle the nation 's business and agriculture the loss suffering and tragedy of people be incalculable not alone do lie in the loss of saving to million of home injury by deprival of work capital to thousand of small business but also in the frantic pressure to recall loan to meet pressure of hoarding and in liquidation of fail bank million of other people have suffer in the loss of home and farm business have be ruin unemployment increase and farmer ' price diminish that this failure to function be unnecessary and be the fault of particular system be plainly indicate by the fact that in great|britain where the economic mechanism have suffer far great shock than own there have not be a single bank failure during the depression again in canada where the situation have be in large degree identical with own there have not be substantial bank failure the creation of the|reconstruction|finance|corporation and the amendment to the|federal|reserve|act serve to defend the nation in a great crisis be not remedy be relief be inconceivable that the|reconstruction|corporation which have extend aid to nearly|6,000 institution and be manifestly but a temporary device can go on indefinitely be to day a matter of satisfaction that the rate of bank failure of hoarding and the demand upon the|reconstruction|corporation have greatly lessen the acute phase of the crisis have obviously pass and the time have now come when this national danger and this failure to respond to national necessity must be end and the measure to end can be safely undertake method of reform have be exhaustively examine there be no reason now why solution should not be find at the present session of the congress inflation of currency or governmental conduct of banking can have no part in these reform the government must abide within the field of constructive organization regulation and the enforcement of safe practice only parallel with reform in the banking law must be change in the|federal|farm|loan|banke system and in the|joint|stock|land|bank some of these change should be direct to permanent improvement and some to emergency aid to people where wish to fight to save farm and home wish again to emphasize this view that these widespread banking reform be a national necessity and be the first requisite for further recovery in agriculture and business should have immediate consideration as step greatly need to further recovery economic cooperation with other nation major difficulty during the|past|two|year find origin in the shock from economic collapse abroad which in turn be the aftermath of if be to secure rapid and assured recovery and protection for the future must cooperate with foreign nation in many measure have actively engage in a world disarmament conference where with success should reduce own tax burden and the tax burden of other major nation should increase political stability of the world should lessen the danger of war by increase defensive power and decrease offensive power of nation would thus open new vista of economic expansion for the world be participate in the formulation of a world economic conference successful result from which would contribute much to advance in agricultural price employment and business currency depreciation and correlate force have contribute greatly to decrease in price level moreover from these origin rise most of the destructive trade barrier now stifle the commerce of the world could by successful action increase security and expand trade through stability in international exchange and monetary value by such action world confidence could be restore would bring courage and stability which will reflect into every home in land the european government obligate to in war debt have request that there should be suspension of payment due the|united|state on december|15 next to be accompany by exchange of view upon this debt question government have inform that do not approve of suspension of the december|15 payment have state that would recommend to the congress method to overcome temporary exchange difficulty in connection with this payment from nation where may be necessary in the meantime wish to reiterate that here be great field of international action which must be consider not in part but as a whole be of most vital interest to people within there be not only grave danger if fail in right action but there also tie immense opportunity for good if shall succeed within success there lie major remedy for economic distress and major progress in stability and security to every fireside in country the welfare of people be dependent upon successful issue of the great cause of world peace world disarmament and organized world recovery nor be too much to say that to day as never before the welfare of mankind and the preservation of civilization depend upon solution of these question such solution can not be attain except by honest friendship by adherence to agreement enter upon until mutually revise and by cooperation amongst nation in a determination to find solution which will be mutually beneficial other legislation have place various legislative need before the congress in previous message and these view require no amplification on this occasion have urge the need for reform in transportation and power regulation in the antitrust law as apply to national resource industry western range conservation extension of federal aid to child health service membership in the|world|court the ratification of the|great|lake st lawrence|seaway|treaty revision of the bankruptcy act revision of federal court procedure and many other press problem these and other special subject shall where necessary deal with by special communication to the congress the activity of government be so great when combine with the emergency activity which have arise out of the world crisis that even the brief review of would render the annual message unduly long shall therefore avail of the fact that every detail of the government be cover in the report to the congress by each of the department and agency of the government conclusion seem to appropriate upon this occasion to make certain general observation upon the principle which must dominate the solution of problem now press upon the nation legislation in response to national need will be effective only if every such act conform to a complete philosophy of the people 's purpose and destiny be a distinctive government with a unique history and background consciously dedicate to specific ideal of liberty and to a faith in the inviolable sanctity of the individual human spirit furthermore the continue existence and adequate functioning of government in preservation of order liberty and stimulation of progress depend upon the maintenance of state local institutional and individual sense of responsibility have build a system of individualism peculiarly own which must not be forget in any governmental act for from have grow great accomplishment than those of any other nation on the social and economic side the background of american system and the motivation of progress be essentially that should allow free play of social and economic force as far as will not limit equality of opportunity and as will at the same time stimulate the initiative and enterprise of people in the maintenance of this balance the|federal|government can permit of no privilege to any person or group should act as a regulatory agent and not as a participant in economic and social life the moment the government participate become a competitor with the people as a competitor become at once a tyranny in whatever direction may touch have around numerous such experience no one of which can be find to have justify except in case where the people as a whole have meet force beyond control such as those of the|great|war and this great depression where the full power of the|federal|government must be exert to protect the people but even these must be limit to an emergency sense and must be promptly end when these danger be overcome with the free development of science and the consequent multitude of invention some of which be absolutely revolutionary in national life the government must not only stimulate the social and economic responsibility of individual and private institution but must also give leadership to cooperative action amongst the people which will soften the effect of these revolution and thus secure social transformation in an orderly manner the high form of self government be the voluntary cooperation within people for such purpose but would emphasize again that social and economic solution as such will not avail to satisfy the aspiration of the people unless conform with the tradition of race deeply grooved in sentiment through a|century|and|a|half of struggle for ideal of life that be root in religion and feed from purely spiritual spring transcript in these|closing|hour of the campaign be conscious that the american people be sum up in mind the candidate ' statement the issue weigh the exposition of party policy make appraisal of party measure and of man and thus prepare individually for final personal decision to be express by ballot at the poll next|tuesday state a|few|days|ago that the most important issue before the american people at this moment be to overcome this crisis what people need be the restoration of normal job and the recovery of agricultural price and of business need help in the meantime to tide over difficulty in order that may not suffer privation or lose farm and home there be other measure which concern the more distant future must not lose sight of but the great balance in which to weigh the great political party today be in attitude toward this immediate problem because in this attitude lie philosophy of government ability to penetrate into cause capacity to meet emergency and to translate measure into action and in these balance should also be weigh the question of honesty in presentation to the people of the fact so that may formulate a proper judgment there be beyond this the common everyday fact as to whether the present administration measure and policy now in action be accomplish the purpose for which be set out and therefore deserve ratification and retention by the people there be also reveal in this accomplishment what may hope for in the way of performance for the future many of hope for the long view development of nation have be interrupt by the necessity to devote concentrated attention to the protection of the american people from the cataclysm which have sweep over the world as the result of the aftermath of the|world|war opponent have endeavor to build a fantastic fiction as to the cause of these event in in order that may blame for all the distress and disaster which have happen not only in country but in the rest of the world and thus resort to the old trick of politic by stimulate a protest vote that be play politic with human misery but in the pursuit of this misrepresentation have demonstrate a total lack of understanding of the real situation with which the government must deal if be ever to find way out of this depression this narrowness of vision this incapacity to reach to the heart of thing be a complete demonstration of unfitness for the still gigantic task of lead the nation back to normal life and the resumption of forward march of progress have deliberately avoid and decry the accumulation of strain which grow out of the|great|war even ignore that such a war take place ignore the piling up of national debt and the debt among combatant nation great than the whole wealth of the|united|state ignore the loss of the productive skill and intelligence of million in europe blot out by battle disease and starvation ignore the poison spring of political instability which lie in the treaty that close the war the fear and hate that have hold armament to double those before that time ignore the new nationalism of a score of small nation spring from the war with all own tariff wall and disturbance to old channel of trade ignore the ruinous government policy which fallaciously seek to build back to prosperity the impoverished country of europe by enlarged borrowing by subsidize industry and employment with taxis that sap the saving upon which industry must be rejuvenate and commerce solidly build under these strain the financial system of many foreign country crash after another these blow strike at through decrease world consumption of good if look back over the distress of these|year find that quarter of the population of the globe have suffer from the flame of revolution many nation be subject to constant change and vacillation other resort to dictatorship and tyranny in desperate attempt to maintain some sort of social order ask to compare that with the condition of the|united|state be part of a world the disturbance of whose remote population affect own financial system market employment and the price of farm product and have many problem of own grow out of the inflation of value during the war and the stupendous increase of debt the failure of foreign country to respond to debt obligation to finally with the desperate crisis abroad the whole world scramble to convert property into gold and thus withdraw from suddenly over of exchange and gold these fear spread to own citizen cause to withdraw in currency from circulation the effect of this be to withdraw vast sum of gold from own use as must protect the gold convertibility of currency with further repercussion of credit stringency unemployment and drop price yet have protect dollar and make ring true on every counter in the world own economist overlook great fundamental factor that while own people consume of production yet no one calculate the effect of worldwide fear upon credit system and on the confidence of the nation which thereby suddenly undermine industry and commerce in the face of these gigantic appal worldwide force opponent set up the hawley smoot tariff bill change as do the tariff on sixth of own import hundredth of the world 's import and introduce long after the collapse start as the cause of all this world catastrophe what an unspeakable travesty upon reason this explanation be suppose that have never have the hawley smoot tariff bill do think for moment that this crush collapse in the structure of the world these revolution these peril to civilization would not have happen and would not have reach into the|united|state and yet in order to make a political campaign by which can play upon discontent so that could hope to create a protest vote be compel to set up this travesty of argument by this class appeal to the negative impulse of man endeavor to lead away from discussion of the actual measure which have be take to meet the actual fact of the world situation and to follow a mirage of miscellaneous vague hope seek to lead away from realization that the restoration now begin should not be interrupt would recall to the unprecedented measure which have introduce by which have bring the full reserve power of the|federal|government into action to save community value and protect every family and fireside so far as be humanly possible from deterioration have prove time and again in history in actual war the altruism and patriotism of people the solidarity of action toward a common objective but in this war against the invisible force have see group of man attempt to profiteer from the misery of people both to increase own fortune and to increase political strength have see the very measure have take for defense of people and reconstruction of recovery subject to the cheap of political misrepresentation have see attempt of these same group even in this national emergency to bring forth a philosophy of government which would destroy the whole american system on which have build the great nation|of|a|century|and|a|half indeed this be the same philosophy of government which have poison all europe have be the fume of the witch 's caldron which boil in russia and in attenuate flavor spread over|half of europe and would by many be introduce into the|united|state in an attempt to secure vote through protest of discontent against emergency condition have have to meet such handicap from opponent both while meet the first emergency which endanger the nation and in the building of employment and agriculture have enumerate at various time in this campaign the measure adopt by the republican administration to meet this emergency have enumerate on several occasion long view policy to cement that recovery and to stimulate progress in country for the future

background of all these instrumentality that be so construct as to act through exist agency to avoid competition of the government with private enterprise and responsibility essence have be that of cooperation so create that with the passage of this emergency can be withdraw leave economic structure in full strength and vitality represent the full use of the federal power in time of emergency to protect the people that be the reason for the social calm in the|united|state as contrast with the riot in nearly every foreign country recently enumerate at detroit some of the evidence of recuperation of the country under these measure in so short a period as|4|months since the destruction of public confidence by the|democratic|house|of|representative cease do not wish to weary with statistic but to show the validity of that progress may mention that in employment over|a|million man have now return to work during these|4|month this be the estimate of government department the estimate of employer place the number at a|million|and|a|half certainly be now gain a|half|million a month last|night hear an evidence an evidence of recuperation that be go on the city of st.|louis have make application for a large sum from the|reconstruction|corporation with which to carry destitute over the|winter be inform yesterday that ask that the application for that loan be cancel as be

withdraw by frightened european holder have continue to increase deposit of bank continue to show steady expansion in have increase by nearly|a|billion|dollars this be money be put to work and an evidence of renew confidence a further indication of the upward movement of industry lie in the increase demand for electrical power which have increase by over|8|percent in the|last|4|months every business index show some progress somewhere in the nation do not want to say in criticism for there be no one more devoted to form of government than but there be unfortunate incident in system and that be that a change of party in power at the national election may come at a difficult moment a change at this election must mean 4|whole|month in which there can be no definition of national policy during which time not only the commander of the force in battle for economic recovery must be change but the subordinate commander as well follow the period of delay and uncertainty the opposition party will as have announce call a special session of congress in order to validate promise and new deal and whether these new policy be for well or bad at|least|a|year must elapse before can emerge into action the battle must stagnate at a time of height and recovery must inevitably be delay and now in contrast with this constructive program of and this administration wish to develop for the democratic program to meet this depression as far as have be able to find any definition to would again call attention to the fact that with the democratic victory in congressional election of leader promise to produce a program which would redeem this country from the depression no such program be produce until be well into the|winter|of|1932 program as develop under the leadership of mr. garner by the|democratic|house|of|representative be pass the collier bill provide for destruction of the|tariff|commission by reduce again to a mere statistical body control by the congress have succeed the relief which so sorely require from competition with country of depreciated currency would today be impossible attempt to instruct by legislation to call an international conference through which the aid of foreign nation would be request to low american tariff by which the independence of the|united|state in control of domestic policy be to be place in the hand of an international body pass an act instruct to negotiate reciprocal the result of which could only be to deprive some locality of protection for the benefit of another and by which the only sible agreement would involve the reduction of farm tariff in to build up market for other good may further suggest that large export commodity in the country be in the hand of a gentleman who will control the next congress pass an omnibus pension bill with unworthy payment as an indication of economical temper pass an inadequate patchwork revenue bill the injustice of which to different industry and group must yet be remedie pass indian claim bill to reopen settlement in order to favor certain locality at the expense of the public treasury- pass a bill instruct the|federal|reserve|system and the treasury to fix price at average prevail during the|years|1921|to|1929 by constantly shift the volume of currency and credit and thus creation of every uncertainty to business and industry by a rubber dollar this bill be stop but have not be remove from political calendar defeat a large part of the national economy measure propose by the administration by refusal to accept recommendation by reduction of ordinary expenditure from to less|than|$50|million a part of which subsequently rescue in the senate pass the garner rainey pork barrel bill increase expenditure by for unnecessary nonproductive public work purely for the benefit of favor locality stop this bill but be still on political calendar pass the cash prepayment of the bonus call for immediate expenditure of and for actual increase in liability of the|federal|government over the original act by stop this bill but be still on political calendar pass the provision for the issuance of over|$2,200|million of greenback currency a reversion to vicious practice already demonstrate in the|last|hundred|years as the most destructive to labor agriculture and business stop this bill and even as late as last|night the democratic candidate fail to frankly disavow pass the rainey bill provide for direct personal banking for every conceivable purpose on every conceivable security to everyone who want money and thus the most destructive entry of the government into private business in a fashion that violate every principle of nation veto this bill but mr. garner still advocate and have not be remove from political calendar inject an expenditure of for entirely unnecessary purpose in time of great emergency the democratic candidate complain daily that do not spend this money fast enough be part of economic program the congress pass proper authority to the executive for reorganization and elimination of useless government commission and bureaus but by refuse recommendation for immediate action destroy usefulness for a long time to come and probably destroy consummation the democratic candidate eloquently urge the balancing of the budget but nowhere disavow these gigantic raid on the treasury under which no budget can ever be balance thus far have recount to the program of the|democratic|house under the leadership of mr. garner whose policy have receive commendation from the democratic convention which ratify by nominate vice president the democratic candidate add to this program the proposal to plant a tree and thereby immediately employ a|million man but the secretary of agriculture have show that the tree available to plant will give a total of less|than|3|days ' work the democratic candidate promise to relieve agriculture with a program which amount to envisage to distressed farmer a great structure of agricultural relief but have refuse to submit to debate have disclose no detail of the plan except method by which can escape from the promise the candidate have promise the immediate inauguration of a program of self liquidate public work such as utilization of water resource flood control and land reclamation to provide employment for all surplus labor at all time that be contain in a letter address to all the unemployed in the|united|state which have have enormous circulation to employ the whole of the unemployed in the|united|state would exceed in cost a year these work be unavailable if the work be there the cost would destroy the credit of the government deprive vast number of the man now work of job and thus destroy the remedy this fantasy be a cruel promise to these suffer man and woman that will be give job by the government which no government could fulfill the|democratic|party make contribution to the emergency by propose to reduce the tariff to a competitive tariff for revenue candidate state that support this promise a competitive tariff today would be ruinous to american agriculture and industry these be the only relief to this emergency that can find in the whole democratic program be mostly destructive have give some of the item of the republican program submit to this collection of item which have be and be propose to the american people governor roosevelt in address of last|night state have be scrupulously careful to make no idle promise to raise no false hope in st.|louis last|night give a list of unclarified promise some of which certainly raise high hope opponent have devote in the|last|few|week to the idea that the|republican|party be endeavor to scare the american people have never find very easily scared and would not believe the american people could be the american people be not be disturb by reassurance from the record that man be be restore to employment at the rate of a month as the result of great program and policy inaugurate by this administration what be disturb the american people be the failure of the democratic candidate to show any satisfaction in this and entire lack of assurance that these measure will be carry forward furthermore find a total absence of constructive proposal from the democratic side for deal with this emergency be confuse by indefinite promise as to the future be dismay by the measure propose by the last democratic|house|of|representatif which at no time have be disavow by the candidate and would destroy the very foundation of the republic resent appeal to protest on the basis of personal misfortune the cause of which have be so brazenly misstate be ask what the support of extreme radical mean to american institution wonder if the divergent part in the sectional element and political element of which consist do not spell a repetition of the quarrel and lack of confidence in candidate so evident before convention and thus an earnest of own incapacity for united national action issue of this campaign have become of more than normal importance and wish to speak on that question that is the maintenance of protective tariff these|states be positively dependent upon the maintenance of protective tariff as a measure of recovery from this depression and the protective tariff be more in danger at this moment than at any time in recent history first because opponent propose to reduce this tariff to the basis of competitive tariff for revenue which mean competition in the american market by the lower pay labor lower standard of living and the cheap land in any part of the world but beyond this the collapse of nation unable to stand the accumulate strain grow out of the|world|war have bring about a depreciation of currency all the way from 10|to|50|percent the result have be a further decrease in wage price and standard of live as compare to breach be be make daily in farm tariff wall wish to make a public survey into the actual purchasing power as a consequence of wage in a number of country to determine from wage the amount of bread and butter which could be purchase at retail with a week 's wage give out those figure and give out show that in the|united|state nearly every group of labor can purchase somewhere between and of bread and butter from weekly wage show that near competitor japan deliver good here could purchase there all the way from to show that this nation could only buy that be the difference in wage and in the face of this democratic opponent propose to reduce tariff propose to do this in violation of historic duty and in order to appeal to other section of the|united|state candidate have refer to tariff as exorbitant and a ghastly jest must bear in mind that except wheat of agricultural product in this and neighboring states be consume within the border of the|united|state and the fate of american agriculture lie in hold the market within the boundary of the|united|state could give a few indication in actual effect of the present situation other than those state at des|moine indianapolis springfield would point out that butter the indicator in dairy product sell in new|york at and yet except for the tariff wall would be sell from new|zealand and europe for and would point out another exhibit flax be north of the canadian border and south of that boundary owe to the protective tariff these price be depressingly low but actually could be low if this tariff be take down some|4|million|acre build up under the protective tariff must go into other product the competition of which will lower price in every other commodity another industry to which governor roosevelt have give especial attention be sugar as to which promise would put another|750,000|acre into competition with other product of the reason why agriculture have not make progress as rapidly in increase price in the|last|4|month comparable with the increase employment of man be this increase competition from depreciated currency country this indeed give the great concern fortunately the republican administration have be able to prevent the destruction of the flexible authority of the|tariff|commission through which alone these breach in the tariff wall may be repair the democratic candidate the|democratic|house|of|representative and in platform promise consistently to destroy this authority of the|tariff|commission and ask can look to these man to repair these breach in the tariff wall when propose to tear down the wall in a speech last|night the democratic candidate state that the|tariff|commission during 2|long|year have investigate duty on only|73 commodity out of|many|thousands again have be misinform and be broadcast misinformation to the american people the|tariff|commission have consider over|250 item instead of the mention a great number of these item when appear for consideration be find to have no basis for action be withdraw by the applicant upon a showing of the fact but a great misrepresentation lie in the fact that except for the very large task that have recently give the commission that is to reconsider the tariff as affect by depreciated currency owe to the collapse of foreign nation docket be practically clear that mean that this tribunal which governor roosevelt say will destroy have attend to practically every tariff application present by american citizen if there be a great number of item which need change be not obvious that the need for this change would have be manifest because the enterprising american citizen would long since have bring to this tribunal for immediate adjustment beyond the possibility of adjustment by the|tariff|commission will widen the protective tariff by legislation if necessary to protect agriculture oil and fat be suffer entirely unnecessarily from foreign import of these commodity the american market should be and must be reserve for the american farmer at all time whether emergency time or normal time governor roosevelt in address last|night also state have be scrupulously careful to engage in no personality no unfair innuendo no baseless charge against the president of the|united|state would like to have someone else answer this but appear that be the one to carry the answer across to the american people would recommend that anyone interested in this statement should read governor roosevelt 's speech from the beginning of this campaign have be compel to take the unprecedented action of call attention to a few of have be also compel to frequently call attention to statement be put out through the|democratic|national|committee and agency which amount to positive calumny in no case have the democratic candidate disavow this action of official committee or agency have naturally profit by silence have be inform in this state that someone be endeavor to picture as have vote in a foreign country as an indication that be not a citizen of the|united|state know be direct from the activity of the democratic local committee but why answer those thing that picture be take from the tax roll of a foreign country where at time rent a house and where there be a tax on every item of rent and where the roll be make up from the tax roll where never vote or have a right to vote this have be privately and publicly denounce by the secretary of state over the|last|8|year have just hear of another of these action which take place yesterday in the|state of ohio the circulation of thousand of handbill state that the farm|board spend annually in salary and have a fund of for travel expense this statement be untrue there follow a long list of salary purport to be pay by state incidentally that mr. roosevelt will abolish the|farm|board if that be true but do not believe be true that will be of interest to the member of farm cooperative in the|united|state and especially in a great part of the northwest as to the first point the administrative expenditure of the board be per annum and would call attention to the fact that the member of the|farm|board receive about|$10,000 a year the salary refer to in this circular do not refer largely to the employee of the|farm|board many be exaggerated but the great bulk of be official employ by farmer own farmer control and farmer manage cooperative because have seek for the high skill in the marketing of product have no control of these salary be pay at the will of the american farmer and organization the organization have build up in this state and the salary be enumerate here as a matter of personal defamation of but the only point of importance for to make now be that this be typical of story be spread through the nation with a view to mislead the people regret that have to refer to ought to be omit from a political discussion throughout the difficulty of the|last|2|years there have stand out in high relief the courage and fortitude of the american people yet steadfast and brave as have be man in the face of suffering and disaster woman have be braver and more steadfast upon the rigor of the world depression as do the rigor of the|world|war have bear most heavily untold anxiety self denial and drudgery have be lot that love one may be assure of that care in mind and body that would equip to meet the problem of the future that the health of people both infant and adult as evidence by vital statistic be now at high point be a notable tribute to the love care and devotion of the woman of the|united|state today heart be gladden by a well found hope of an early return to normal living condition in country must not be disappoint in of recent|month these woman bow with the burden of own trouble have not be too preoccupied to send many message of sympathy and encouragement unmoved either by blind resentment or by cruel calumny have do much to sustain belief in the justice as well as the courage of countryman whatever fortune may have in store for during the remain year of life heart will ever be fill with gratitude to the woman of america for the understanding the faith and the cooperation which have give without stint during all of year of public service and not only in the home of country have woman bear full share of the burden of the|day more and more in the change condition of modern life woman have have to take place side by side with man in factory in business in professional and in political life even before enfranchisement president theodore|roosevelt realize the need for woman in government when appoint a woman to head newly create children's|bureau in the|department|of|labor and that office have always be hold by a woman many woman be now hold post of grave responsibility in city and county and state and nation and number will be greatly increase a step forward have be take in the|last|year the first woman to represent the|united|state in a great international conference be miss mary|e.|woolley send by as a member of the american delegation to the|disarmament|conference|at|geneva be a most distinguished service have appoint an imposing list of woman to public duty and have prove to have the high sense of service and the high kind of ability since the woman of america attain the vote have naturally force certain question into wide attention of the nation education home protection and child welfare be as thoroughly bind up in the politic of the nation as any other issue as a result of the enfranchisement of woman have observe in public discussion in this campaign that woman frequently take a long view of national life than do a great many man that be natural with woman be intensely concerned with the policy which guarantee open equality of opportunity for the future of boy and girl be a comfort to find familiar with the measure have present to add to this security and be also familiar with the lack of response with which the|democratic|house meet these measure have long experience courageous and tenacious ability in organization for public purpose during the|food|administration be pleasure to cooperate with the woman and be first opportunity to see the woman who organize a nation for save that soldier and ally may be feed soon after be with the woman that organize the measure to save the life of european child soon after be with the woman that organize the better|homes movement a|few|years|ago when begin to

work largely among woman in order to get a proper perspective on the subject because be the person in the community that have the experience to do both these conference bring high result in the advancement of public thought be already ring through national life in concrete public action have come to know the great ability of womanhood for cooperative action never cease nor become discouraged until success be attain of the great problem which demand safeguard probably none arise in high value than that of prevent war this be a primary necessity to the future of the nation can not as a people run the risk of have whole civilization degenerate and tear apart by such grim recurrence there be a fundamental source for prevention which have be too much overlook in this campaign no one can deny the fact that the depression would never have take place have not be for the destructive force loosen by if be to ensure that country shall not be rack and endanger by recurrence of such calamity the first measure for safety be that should have peace in the world have a vital part to play in the setup of machinery to replace war and force with the peaceful settlement of controversy between the nation properly refuse to entangle in age old controversy in other part of the world face be turn forward not backward have take the position that will not participate in try to compel people to engage in the settlement of controversy by the use of force the|kellogg|pact have be advance by this administration to a point now accept by the world as of far great potency than be even contemplate at the time of inauguration under the policy have advance have definitely secure that the public opinion of the world will be mobilize and concentrate against those who violate that pact the whole history of this beautiful western country constitute a monument to the heroism of american woman and that pioneer spirit which bear so large a part in the development of the farm and fireside that now cover the western plain have come to full expression during these|later|years in the assumption by woman of a full measure of political responsibility as american citizen deep appreciation be give to the army of woman who have bear so valiant a part in this campaign lofty conception of governmental affair and keen understanding of political party and issue have give a new meaning to the history of american progress in these|closing|hours be realize that have be draw more deeply into this campaign than most president the emergency with which have be deal during the|past|30|year have call upon for such continue and concentrated attention at have be so complicated and technical have require such imperative and instant action that when this campaign begin be force to the realization that few other responsible official of the government hold the full knowledge of all the ramification of a program which be not yet fully understand by the country have feel that the president of the|united|state constantly review the history of many struggle know the character of people should never flinch in confidence in the future deem due to and to the common cause serve to bring to the direct story of the endeavor that have be undertake for the common good in these|past|years in the|past|month have receive many thousand of communication from people wish to express to and to the comfort have have in the realization have give to that concern have travel with mine as have discuss together the grave issue of the period in the solemn sense that belong to last word of this campaign assure that have endeavor in the presentation of these issue to appeal to the thoughtful people of the|united|state that have keep foremost in thought the welfare of country that vision have be of home and necessity and accept this great demonstration as evidence of the support which be give to out of conviction in this battle have make no effort to appeal to destructive emotion have make an endeavor to appeal to reason which can only hope have be effective have fix faith upon the logical conclusion of the thoughtful people who have never fail this country in any|hour of danger transcript this campaign be more than a contest between|two man be more than a contest between|two party be a contest between philosophy of government be tell by the opposition that must have a change that must have a new deal be not the change that come from normal development of national life to which object but the proposal to alter the whole foundation of national life which have be build through generation of testing and struggle and of the principle upon which have build the nation the expression opponent use must refer to important change in economic and social system and system of government otherwise be nothing but vacuous word and realize that in this time of distress many of people be ask whether social and economic system be incapable of that great primary function of provide security and comfort of life to all of the fireside of home in america whether social system provide for the fundamental development and progress of people whether form of government be capable of originate and sustain that security and progress this question be the basis upon which opponent be appeal to the people in fear and distress be propose change and so call new deal which would destroy the very foundation of american system people should consider the primary fact before come to the judgment — not merely through political agitation the glitter of promise and the discouragement of temporary hardship whether will support change which radically affect the whole system which have be build up by a|hundred|and|fifty|year of the toil of the father should not approach the question in the despair with which opponent would clothe economic system have receive abnormal shock during which temporarily dislocate normal functioning these shock have in large sense come from without border but say to that system of government have enable to take such strong action as to prevent the disaster which would otherwise have come to nation have enable further to develop measure and program which be now demonstrate ability to bring about restoration and progress must go deeper than platitude and emotional appeal of the public platform in the campaign if will penetrate to the full significance of the change which opponent be attempt to float upon the wave of distress and discontent from the difficulty be pass through can find what opponent would do after search the record of appeal to discontent group and sectional interest must search for in the legislative act which sponsor and pass in the democratic control house|of|representatif in the last session of congress must look into measure for which vote and which be defeat must inquire whether or not the presidential and vice presidential candidate have disavow these act if have not must conclude that form a portion and be a substantial indication of the profound change propose and must look still further than this as to what revolutionary change have be propose by the candidate must look into the type of leader who be campaign for the democratic ticket whose philosophy have be well know all life whose demand for a change in the american system be frank and forceful can respect the sincerity of these man in desire to change form of government and social and economic system though shall do good tonight to prove be wrong refer particularly to senator norris senator lafollette senator cutting senator huey|long senator wheeler william|r.|hearst and other exponent of a social philosophy different from the traditional american unless these man feel assurance of support to idea certainly would not be support these candidate and the|democratic|party the seal of these man indicate that have sure confidence that will have voice in the administration of government may say at once that the change propose from all these democratic principle and ally be of the most profound and penetrate character if be bring about this will not be the american which have know in the past let pause for a moment and examine the american system of government of social and economic life which be now propose that should alter system be the product of race and of experience in build a nation to height unparallele in the whole history of the world be a system peculiar to the american people differ essentially from all other in the world be an american system be found on the conception that only through order liberty through freedom to the individual and equal opportunity to the individual will initiative and enterprise be summon to spur the march of progress be by the maintenance of equality of opportunity and therefore of a society absolutely fluid in freedom of the movement of human particle that individualism depart from the individualism of europe resent class distinction because there can be no rise for the individual through the frozen strata of class and no stratification of class can take place in a mass liven by the free rise of particle thus in ideal the able and ambitious be able to rise constantly from the bottom to leadership in the community this freedom of the individual create of the necessity and the cheerful willingness of man to act co - operatively in a|thousand way and for every purpose as occasion arise and permit such voluntary co - operation to be dissolve as soon as have serve purpose to be replace by new voluntary association for new purpose there have thus grow within to gigantic importance a new conception that is this voluntary co - operation within the community co - operation to perfect the social organization co - operation for the care of those in distress co - operation for the advancement of knowledge of scientific research of education for co - operative action in the advancement of many phase of economic life this be self government by the people outside of government be the most powerful development of individual freedom and equal opportunity that have take place in the|century|and|a|half since fundamental institution be found be in the further development of this co - operation and a sense of responsibility that should find solution for many of complex problem and not by the extension of government into economic and social life the great function of government be to build up that co - operation and most resolute action should be to deny the extension of bureaucracy have develop great agency of co - operation by the assistance of the government which promote and protect the interest of individual and the small unit of business the federal reserve system in strengthening and support of the small bank the|farm|board in strengthening and support of the farm co - operative the home|loan bank in the mobilizing of building and loan association and saving bank the federal land bank in give independence and strength to land mortgage association the great mobilization of relief to distress the mobilization of business and industry in measure of recovery and a score of other activity be not socialism be the essence of protection to the development of free man the primary conception of this whole american system be not the regimentation of man but the co - operation of free man be found upon the conception of responsibility of the individual to the community of the responsibility of local government to the state of the state to the national government be found on a peculiar conception of self government design to maintain this equal opportunity to the individual and through decentralization bring about and maintain these responsibility the centralization of government will undermine responsibility and will destroy the system government differ from all previous conception not only in this decentralization but also in the separation of function between the legislative executive and judicial arm of government in which the independence of the judicial arm be the keystone of the whole structure be found on a conception that in time of emergency when force be run beyond control of individual or other co - operative action beyond the control of local community and of states then the great reserve power of the|federal|government shall be bring into action to protect the community but when these force have cease there must be a return of state local and individual responsibility the implacable march of scientific discovery with train of new invention present every|year new problem to government and new problem to the social order question often arise whether in the face of the growth of these new and gigantic tool democracy can remain master in own house can preserve the fundamental of american system contend that can and contend that this american system of our have demonstrate validity and superiority over any system yet invent by human mind have demonstrate in the face of the great test of history that be the emergency which have face in when the political and economic weakness of many nation of europe the result of the|world|war and aftermath finally culminate in collapse of institution the delicate adjustment of economic and social life receive a shock unparalleled in history no one know that well than of new|york no one know cause well than that the crisis be so great that many of the lead bank seek directly or indirectly to convert asset into gold or equivalent with the result that practically cease to function as credit institution that many of citizen seek flight for capital to other country that many of attempt to hoard gold in large amount these be but indication of the flight of confidence and of the belief that government could not overcome these force yet these force be overcome perhaps by narrow margin and this action demonstrate what the courage of a nation can accomplish under the resolute leadership in and say the|republican|party because opponent before and during the crisis propose no constructive program though some of member patriotically support later on the|democratic|house|of|representative do develop the real thought and idea of but be so destructive that have to be defeat for would have destroy not heal in spite of all these obstruction do succeed form of government do prove equal to the task save this nation from a|quarter|of|a|century of chaos and degeneration and preserve the saving the insurance policy give a fighting chance to man to hold home save the integrity of government and the honesty of the american dollar and instal measure which today be bring back recovery employment agriculture business all of these show the steady if slow healing of enormous wound therefore contend that the problem of today be to continue these measure and policy to restore this american system to normal functioning to repair the wound have receive to correct the weakness and evil which would defeat that system to enter upon a series of deep change to embark upon this inchoate new deal which have be propound in this campaign would be to undermine and destroy american system before enter upon such course would like to consider what the result of this american system have be during the|last|thirty|years — that is single generation for if can be demonstrate that by mean of this unequalled political social and economic system have secure a lift in the standard of living and a diffusion of comfort and hope to man and woman the growth of equal opportunity the widening of all opportunity such as have never be see in the history of the world then should not tamper with or destroy but on the contrary should restore and by gradual improvement and perfection foster into new performance for country and for child now if look back over the last generation find that the number of family and therefore home have increase from sixteen|to five|million or in that time have build for new and well home have equip home with electricity thereby have lift infinite drudgery from woman and man the barrier of time and space have be sweep away life have be make free the intellectual vision of every individual have be expand by the installation of telephone radio and the service of automobile city have be make magnificent with beautiful building park and playground countryside have be knit together with splendid road have increase by time the use of electrical power and thereby take sweat from the back of man in this broad sweep real wage and purchase power of man and woman have steadily increase new comfort have steadily come to the|hour of labor have decrease the 12-hour day have disappear even the day have almost go be now advance the|5-day|week the portal of opportunity to child have ever widen while population grow by but have increase the number of child in high school by those in institution of high learning by with all spending multiply by time the saving in bank and in building and loan association multiply by the amount of life insurance with the enlargement of leisure have come to a full life gain new vision of hope more nearly realize national aspiration and give increase scope to the creative power of every individual and expansion of every man 's mind people in these|thirty|year grow in the sense of social responsibility there be profound progress in the relation of the employer and employ have more nearly meet with a full hand the most sacred obligation of man that is the responsibility of a man to neighbor support to school hospital and institution for the care of the afflict surpass in total of billion the proportionate service in any period of history in any nation in the world three|years|ago there come a break in this progress a break of the same type have meet time a century and yet have overcome but eighteen|months|later come a further blow by shock transmit to by the earthquake of the collapse in nation throughout the world as the aftermath of the|world|war the working of system be dislocate million of man and woman be out of job businessmen and farmer suffer distress be bitter do not seek to minimize the depth of may thank god that in view of this storm still have job yet this must not distract thought from the suffering of the other but ask what have happen these year of incomparable improvement in the scale of living the advance of comfort and intellectual life inspiration and ideal do not arise without right principle animate the american system which produce shall that system be discard because vote seek man appeal to distress and say that the machinery be all wrong and that must be abandon or tamper with be not more sensible to realize the simple fact that some extraordinary force have be throw into the mechanism temporarily derange operation be not wise to believe that the difficulty be not with the principle upon which american system be found and design through all these generation of inheritance should not purpose be to restore the normal working of that system which have bring to such immeasurable benefit and not destroy and in order to indicate to that the proposal of opponent will endanger or destroy system propose to analyze a few of the proposal of opponent in the relation to these fundamental first a proposal of opponent which would break down the american system be the expansion of government expenditure by yield to sectional and group raid on the|public|treasury the extension of government expenditure beyond the minimum limit necessary to conduct the proper function of the government enslave man to work for the government if combine the whole governmental expenditure national state and municipal — will find that before the world way each citizen work theoretically five|day out of each|year for the government today work for the support of all form of government day out of the|year no nation can conscript citizen for this proportion of man 's time without national impoverishment and destruction of liberty nation can not do without destruction to whole conception of the american system have be force in this emergency to unusual expenditure but in partial alleviation of these extraordinary and unusual expenditure the|republican|administration have make a successful effort to reduce the ordinary running expense of the government opponent have persistently interfere with such policy only need recall to that the|democratic|house|of|representativ pass bill in the last session that would have increase expenditure by or express in day ' labor this would have mean the conscription of sixteen|day ' additional work from every citizen for the government this stop furthermore refuse to accept recommendation from the administration in respect to of reduction in ordinary expenditure and finally force upon increase expenditure of in spite of this the ordinary expense of the government have be reduce upwards of during this present administration will be decidedly further reduce but the major point wish to make — the disheartening part of these proposal of opponent be that represent successful pressure of minority would appeal to sectional and group political support and thereby impose terrific burden upon every home in the country these thing can and must be resist but can only be resist if there shall be live and virile public support to the administration in opposition to political log rolling and the sectional and group raid on the treasury for distribution of public money which be cardinal in the congerie of element which make up the|democratic|party these expenditure propose by the|democratic|house|of|representative for the benefit of special group and special section of country directly undermine the american system those who pay be in the last analysis the man who work at the bench the desk and on the farm take away comfort stifle leisure and destroy equal opportunity second another proposal of opponent which would destroy the american system be that of inflation of the currency the bill which pass the last session of the|democratic|house call upon the treasure of the|united|state to issue in paper currency that would be unconvertible into solid value call what will greenback or fiat money be that nightmare which overhung own country for year after third in the last session the congress under the personal leadership of the democratic vice presidential candidate and ally in the senate enact a law to extend the government into personal banking business this be compel to veto out of fidelity to the whole american system of life and government fourth another proposal of opponent which would wholly alter american system of life be to reduce the protective tariff to a competitive tariff for revenue the protective tariff and result upon economic structure have become gradually embed into economic life since the first protective tariff act pass by the|american|congress under the administration of george|washington there have be gap at time of democratic control when this protection have be take away but have be so embed that removal have never fail to bring disaster fifth another proposal be that the government go into the power business three|years|ago in view of the extension of the use of transmission of power over state border and the difficulty of state regulatory body in the face of this interstate action recommend to the congress that such interstate power should be place under regulation by the|federal|government in co - operation with the state authority that recommendation be in accord with the principle of over the|last|fifty|year to provide regulation where public interest have develop in tool of industry which be beyond control and regulation of the states succeed in create an independent power|commission to handle such matter but the|democratic|house decline to approve the further power to this commission necessary for such regulation have state unceasingly that be oppose to go into the power business have insist upon rigid regulation the democratic candidate have declare that under the same condition which may make local action of this character desirable be prepared to put the|federal|government into the power business be be actively support by a score of senator in this campaign many of whose expense be be pay by the|democratic|national|committee who be pledge to federal|government development and operation of electrical power find in the instruction to campaign speaker issue by the|democratic|national|committee that be instruct to criticize action in the veto of the bill which would have put the government permanently into the operation of power at muscle shoal with a capital from the|federal|treasury of over|$100,000,000 in fact democratic senators be all except vote to override that veto in that bill be the flat issue of permanently in competitive business veto because of principle and not because be especially the power business in the veto state that be firmly opposed to the|federal|government enter into any business the major purpose of which be competition with citizen say there be national emergency which require that the government should temporarily enter the field of business but that must be emergency action and in matter where the cost of the project be secondary to much high consideration there be many locality where the|federal|government be justify in the construction of great dam and reservoir where navigation flood control reclamation or stream regulation be of dominant importance and where be beyond the capacity or purpose of private or local government capital to construct in these case power be often a by product and should be dispose of by contract or lease but for the|federal|government to deliberately go out to build up and expand such an occasion to the major purpose of a power and manufacturing business be to break down the initiative and enterprise of the american people be destruction of equality of opportunity among people be the negation of the ideal upon which civilization have be base this bill raise of the important issue confront people that be squarely the issue of federal|government ownership and operation of power and manufacturing business not as a minor by product but as a major purpose involve in this question be the agitation against the conduct of the power industry the power problem be not to be solve by the|federal|government go into the power business nor be to be solve by the project in this bill the remedy for abuse in the conduct of that industry lie in regulation and not by the|federal|government enter upon the business have recommend to the congress on various occasion that action should be take to establish federal regulation of interstate power in co - operation with state authority this bill would launch the|federal|government upon a policy of ownership of power utility upon a basis of competition instead of by the proper government function of regulation for the protection of all the people hesitate to contemplate the future of institution of government and of or country if the preoccupation of official be to be no longer the promotion of justice and equal opportunity but be to be devote to barter in the market that be not liberalism be degeneration from utterance in this campaign and elsewhere be justify in the conclusion that opponent propose to put the|federal|government in the power business with all addition to federal bureaucracy tyranny over state and local government undermining of state and local responsibility and initiative sixth may cite another instance of absolutely destructive proposal to american system by opponent recently there be circulate through the unemployed in this country a letter from the democratic candidate in which state that would support measure for the inauguration of self liquidate public work such as the utilization of water resource flood control land reclamation to provide employment for all surplus labor at all time especially emphasize that promise to promote employment for all surplus labor at all time at first could not believe that any one would be so cruel as to hold out a hope so absolutely impossible of realization to those who be unemployed but the authenticity of this promise have be verify and protest against such frivolous promise be hold out to a suffering people be easily demonstrable that no such employment can be find but the point wish to make here and now be the mental attitude and spirit of to attempt be another mark of the character of the new deal and the destructive change which mean the total abandonment of every principle upon which this government and the american system be found if be possible to give this employment to people by the government would cost upwards of a year have say before and want to repeat on this occasion that the only method by which can stop the suffering and unemployment be by return people to normal job in normal home carry on normal function of living this can be do only by sound process of protect and stimulate recovery of the exist economic system upon which have build progress thus far prevent distress and give such sound employment as can find in the meantime seventh recently at indianapolis call attention to the statement make by governor roosevelt in address on october|25th with respect to the|supreme|court of the|united|state say after march|4,|1929 be in complete control of all branch of the|government — executive senate and house and may add for good measure in order to make complete the|supreme|court as well be not call upon to defend the|supreme|court of the|united|state from this slur reflection fortunately that court have jealously maintain over the|year high standard of integrity impartiality and freedom from influence of either the executive or congress so that the confidence of the people be sound and unshaken but be the democratic candidate really propose conception of the relation of the executive and the|supreme|court if that be idea be propose the most revolutionary new deal the most stupendous breaking of precedent the most destructive undermining of the very safeguard of form of government yet propose by a presidential candidate eighth in order that may get at the philosophical background of the mind which pronounce the necessity for profound change in american system and a new deal would call attention to an address deliver by the democratic candidate in san|francisco early in october say industrial plant be build the problem just now be whether under exist condition be not overbuilt last frontier have long since be reach there be practically no more free land there be no safety valve in the western prairie where can go for a new start the mere building of more industrial plant the organization of more corporation be as likely to be as much a danger as a help task now be not the discovery of natural resource or necessarily the production of more good be the sober less dramatic business of administer the resource and plant already in hand establish market for surplus production of meet the problem of under consumption distribute the wealth and product more equitably and adapt the economic organization to the service of the people there be many of these expression with which no one would quarrel but do challenge the whole idea that have end the advance of america that this country have reach the zenith of power the height of development that be the counsel of despair for the future of america that be not the spirit by which shall emerge from this depression that be not the spirit that make this country if be true every american must abandon the road of countless progress and unlimited opportunity deny that the promise of american life have be fulfil for that mean have begin the decline and fall no nation can cease to move forward without degeneration of spirit if these measure these promise which have discuss or these failure to disavow these project this attitude of mind mean anything mean the enormous expansion of the|federal|government mean the growth of bureaucracy such as have never see in history no man who have not occupy position in washington can fully realize the constant battle which must be carry on against incompetence corruption tyranny of government expand into business activity if first examine the effect on form of government of such a program come at once to the effect of the most gigantic increase in expenditure ever know in history that alone would break down the saving the wage the equality of opportunity among people these measure would transfer vast responsibility to the|federal|government from the local government and the individual but that be not all would break down form of government legislative body can not delegate authority to any dictator but without such delegation every member of these body be impel in representation of the interest of constituent constantly to seek privilege and demand service in the use of such agency every time extend arm senators and congressmen become actual board of director of that business capable man can not be choose by politic for all the various talent require even if be superman if there be no politic in the selection of the congress if there be no constant pressure for this and for that so large a number would be incapable as a board of director of any institution at once when these extension take place by the|federal|government the authority and responsibility of state government and institution be undermine every enterprise of private business be at once halt to know what federal action be go to be destroy initiative and courage can do no well than quote that great statesman of labor the late samuel|gomper in speaking of a similar situation be a question of whether shall be government ownership or private ownership under control if be a minority of in this convention would want to cast vote so that the man of labor shall not willingly enslave to government in industrial effort have hear a great deal in this campaign about reactionary conservative progressive liberal and radical have not yet hear an attempt by any of the orator who mouth these phrase to define the principle upon which base these classification there be thing can say without any question of doubt that that the spirit of liberalism be to create free man be not the regimentation of man be not the extension of bureaucracy have say in this city before now that can not extend the mastery of government over the daily life of a people without somewhere make master of people 's soul and thought expansion of government in business mean that the government in order to protect from the political consequence of error be drive irresistibly without peace to great and great control of the nation 's press and platform free speech do not live many hour after free industry and free commerce die be a false liberalism that interpret into government operation of business every step in that direction poison the very root of liberalism poison political equality free speech free press and equality of opportunity be the road not to liberty but to less liberty true liberalism be find not strive to spread bureaucracy but in strive to set bound to true liberalism seek all legitimate freedom first in the confident belief that without such freedom the pursuit of other blessing be in vain liberalism be a force truly of the spirit proceed from the deep realization that economic freedom can not be sacrifice if political freedom be to be preserve even if the government conduct of business could give the maximum of efficiency instead of least efficiency would be purchase at the cost of freedom would increase rather than decrease abuse and corruption stifle initiative and invention undermine development of leadership cripple mental and spiritual energy of people extinguish equality of opportunity and dry up the spirit of liberty and progress man who be go about this country announce that be liberal because of promise to extend the government in business be not liberal be reactionary of the|united|state and do not wish to be misquote or misunderstood do not mean that government be to part with iota of national resource without complete protection to the public interest have already state that democracy must remain master in own house have state that abuse and wrongdoing must be punish and control nor do wish to be misinterpret as state that the|united|states be a free for all and devil –take the hindermost society the very essence of equality of opportunity of american system be that there shall be no monopoly or domination by any group or section in this country whether be business sectional or a group interest on the contrary american system demand economic justice as well as political and social justice be not a system of be not set up the contention that american system be perfect no human ideal have ever be perfectly attain since humanity be not perfect but the wisdom of forefather and the wisdom of the man who have precede in this office hold to the conception that progress can be attain only as the sum of accomplishment of free individual and have hold unalterably to these principle in the ebb and flow of economic life people in time of prosperity and ease naturally tend to neglect the vigilance over right moreover wrongdoing be obscure by apparent success in enterprise then insidious disease and wrongdoing grow apace but have in the past see in time of distress and difficulty that wrongdoing and weakness come to the surface and people in endeavor to correct these wrong be tempt to extreme which may destroy rather than build be man who do wrong not institution be man who violate the law and public right be man not institution who must be punish in acceptance speech at palo|alto state of the old aspiration of the human race be the abolition of poverty by poverty mean the grinding by under nourishment cold ignorance fear of old age to those who have the will to work state in america today be nearer a final triumph over poverty than in any land the poorhouse have vanish from among have not reach that goal but give a chance to go forward shall with the help of god be in sight of the|day when poverty will be banish from this nation countryman the proposal of opponent represent a profound change in american life less in concrete proposal bad as that may be than by implication and by evasion dominantly in spirit represent a radical departure from the foundation of which have make this the great nation in the world this election be not a mere shift from the in to the out mean decide the direction nation will take over|a|century to come conception of america be a land where man and woman may walk in order liberty where may enjoy the advantage of wealth not concentrate in the hand of a few but diffuse through the life of all where build and safeguard home give to child full opportunity of american life where every man shall be respect in the faith that conscience and heart direct to follow where people secure in liberty shall have leisure and impulse to seek a full life that lead to the release of the energy of man and woman to the wide vision and high hope lead to opportunity for great and great service not alone of man to man in country but from country to the world lead to health in body and a spirit unfettere youthful eager with a vision stretch beyond the farth horizon will an open mind sympathetic and generous but that must be build upon experience with the past upon the foundation which have make country great must be the product of truly american system transcript mr. chairman and fellow citizen in accept the great honor that have bring to desire to speak so simply and so plainly that every man and woman in the|united|state who may hear or read word can not misunderstand the|last|3|year have be a time of unparalleled economic calamity have be year of great suffering and hardship than any which have come to the american people since the aftermath of the|civil|war as look back over these troubled year realize that have pass through different stage of dislocation and distress before the storm break be steadily gain in prosperity wound from the war be rapidly heal advance in science and invention have open vast vista of new progress be prosperous become optimistic all of from optimism some of go to overexpansion in anticipation of the future and from overexpansion to reckless speculation in the soil poison by speculation grow those ugly weed of waste exploitation and abuse of financial power in this overproduction and speculative mania march with the rest of the whole world then come retribution by the inevitable worldwide slump in the consumption of good in price and employment at that juncture be the normal penalty for a reckless boom such as have witness a score of time in national history through such depression have always pass safely after a relatively short period of loss of hardship and of adjustment have adopt policy in the government which be fitting to the situation gradually the country begin to right eighteen|months|ago there be a solid basis for hope that recovery be in sight then there come to a new calamity a blow from abroad of such dangerous character as to strike at the very safety of the republic the country of europe prove unable to withstand the stress of the depression the memory of the world have ignore the fact that the insidious disease leave by have not be cure the skill and intelligence of million in europe have be blot out by battle by disease and by starvation stupendous burden of national debt have be build up poison spring of political instability lie in the treaty which close the war fear and hate hold armament to double those before the great conflict government be fallaciously seek to build back by enlarged borrowing by subsidize industry and employment from taxis that slowly sap the saving upon which industry and rejuvenated commerce must be build under these strain the financial system of foreign country crash by new blow with decrease world consumption of good and from fail financial system rain upon people be a part of the world the disturbance of whose remote population affect financial system employment market and the price of farm product thus begin the worldwide storm grow rapidly to hurricane force and the great economic emergency in all the history of the world unexpected unforeseen violent shock with every|month bring new danger and new emergency to country fear and apprehension grip the heart of people in every village and city if look back over the disaster of these|3|year find that quarter of the population of the globe have suffer from the flame of revolution many nation have be subject to constant change and vacillation of government other have resort to dictatorship or tyranny in desperate attempt to preserve some kind of social order may pause for short illustration of the character of single destructive force arise from these cause which have be compel to meet that be effect upon financial structure foreign country in the face of own failure the failure of neighbor not believe that have either the courage or the ability or the strength to meet this crisis withdraw from the|united|state over include a|billion of gold own alarmed citizen withdraw over|$1,600|million of currency from bank into hoarding these action combine with the fear that generate cause a shrinkage of credit available for the conduct of industry and commerce by several time even these vast sum visible expression be the failure of bank and business the demoralization of security and real property value of the commodity price and of employment and that be but of the invade force of destruction that have be compel to meet in the|last|18|months course be open to may have do nothing that would have be utter ruin instead meet the situation with proposal to private business and to the congress of the most gigantic program of economic defense and counterattack ever evolve in the history of the republic put that program in action measure have repel these attack of fear and panic have maintain the financial integrity of the government have cooperate to restore and stabilize the situation abroad as a nation have pay every dollar demand of have use the credit of the government to aid and protect institution both public and private have provide method and assurance that none suffer from hunger or cold amongst people have institute measure to assist farmer and homeowner have create vast agency for employment above all have maintain the sanctity of the principle upon which this republic have grow great in a large sense the test of the success of program be simple people while suffer great hardship have be and will be care for in the long view institution have be sustain intact and be now function with increase confidence for the future as a nation be undefeated and unafraid and again above all government by the people have not be defile with the humility of who by necessity have stand in the midst of this storm can say with pride that the distinction for these accomplishment belong not to the government or to any individual be due to the intrepid soul of people be to character fortitude initiative and courage that owe these result of this generation do not build this great ship|of|state but the policy that have inaugurate have protect and aid navigation in this terrible storm these policy and program have not be partisan gladly give tribute to those member of in the congress whose patriotic cooperation against factional and demagogic opposition have assist in a score of great undertaking likewise give credit to democratic as well as republican leader among citizen for cooperation and help a record of these danger and these policy of the|last|3|years will be set down in the book much of be of interest only to history interest now be in the future dwell upon these policy and these program and problem only where illustrate the question of the|day and course for the future as a government and as a people still have much to do must continue the building of measure of restoration must profit by the lesson of this experience before enter upon a discussion of these policy wish to say something of conception of the relation of government to the people and the responsibility of both particularly as apply to these time the spirit and the devising of this government by the people be to sustain a dual purpose on the hand to protect people amongst nation and in domestic emergency by great national power and on the other to preserve individual liberty and freedom through local self government the function of the|federal|government in these time be to use reserve power and strength for the protection of citizen and local government by the support to institution against force beyond control be not the function of the government to relieve individual of responsibility to neighbor or to relieve private institution of responsibility to the public or the local government to the states or the responsibility of state government to in give that protection and that aid must insist that all of exert responsibility in full be vital that the program of the government shall not compete with or replace any of but shall add to initiative and to strength be vital that by the use of public revenue and public credit in emergency that the nation shall be strengthen and not weaken and in all these emergency and crisis and in all future policy must also preserve the fundamental principle of social and economic system that system be round upon a conception of order freedom the test of that freedom be that there should be maintain an equality of opportunity to every individual so that may achieve for the good to which character ability and ambition entitle be only by the release of initiative this insistence upon individual responsibility that accrue the great sum of individual accomplishment which carry this nation forward this be not an individualism which permit man to run riot in selfishness or to override equality of opportunity for other permit no violation of order liberty in the race after false god of materialism man and group have forget country equality of opportunity contain no conception of exploitation by any selfish ruthless class minded man or group have no place in the american system as against these stand the guide ideal and the concept of nation propose to maintain the solution of many problem which arise from the shift scene of national life be not to be find in haphazard experimentation or by revolution must be through organic development of national life under these ideal must secure that cooperative action which bring initiative and strength outside of the government do not follow because difficulty be stupendous because there be some soul timorous enough to doubt the validity and effectiveness of ideal and system that must turn to a state control or state direct social or economic system in order to cure trouble that be not liberalism that be tyranny be the regimentation of man under autocratic bureaucracy with all extinction of liberty of hope and of opportunity of course no man of understanding say that system work perfectly do not for the human race be not yet perfect nevertheless the movement of true civilization be towards freedom rather than regimentation and that be ideal ofttimes the tendency of democracy in the presence of national danger be to strike blindly to listen to demagogue and to slogan all of which destroy and do not save have refuse to be stampede into such course ofttimes democracy elsewhere in the world have be unable to move fast enough to save in emergency there have be dishearten delay and failure in legislation and private action which add to the loss of people yet this democracy of have prove ability to act emergency measure of the|last|3|years form a definite strategy dominate in the background by these american principle and ideal form a continuous campaign wag against the force of destruction on an ever widen and a constantly shift front thus have hold that the|federal|government should in the presence of great national danger use power to give leadership to the initiative the courage and the fortitude of the people but that must insist upon individual community and state responsibility that should furnish leadership to assure the coordination and unity of great exist agency governmental and private for economic and humanitarian action that where become necessary to meet emergency beyond the power of these agency by the creation of new governmental instrumentality that should be of such character as not to supplant or weaken but rather to supplement and strengthen the initiative and enterprise of people that must directly or indirectly serve all of the people and above all that should be set up in such form that once the emergency be past can and must be demobilize and withdraw leave governmental economic and social structure strong and whole have not fear boldly to adopt unprecedented measure to meet unprecedented violence of the storm but because have keep ever before these eternal principle of nation in ideal be the same as be when the people give the presidency to trust shall keep so have resolutely reject the temptation under pressure of immediate event to resort to those panacea and short cut which even if temporarily successful would ultimately undermine and weaken what have slowly be build and mold by experience and effort throughout these|150|year be in accordance with these principle that at the first stage of the depression call upon the leader of business and of labor and of agriculture to meet with and induce by own initiative to organize against the panic with all devastating destruction to uphold wage until the cost of living be adjust to spread exist employment through shortened|hours and to advance construction work against future need be in pursuance of that same policy that have each winter thereafter assume the leadership in mobilize all of the voluntary and official organization throughout the country to prevent suffering from hunger and cold and to protect million of family stricken by drought and when become advisable to strengthen the states who could no longer carry the full burden of relief to distress be in accordance with these principle that hold that the|federal|government should do so through loan to the states and thus maintain the fundamental responsibility of the states stop the attempt to turn this effort to the politic of selfish sectional demand and keep base upon human need be in accordance with these principle that in aid to unemployment expend some|$600|million in federal construction of such public work as can be justify as bring early and definite return have oppose the distortion of these need work into pork barrel nonproductive work which impoverish the nation be in accord with these principle and these purpose that have make provision for of loan to self support work so that may increase employment in productive labor reject project of wasteful nonproductive work allocate for purpose of attract vote instead of afford relief thereby instead of wasteful drain upon the taxpayer secure the return of cost to government agency and at the same time increase the wealth of the nation be in accordance with these principle that have strengthen the capital of the federal land bank that on the hand confidence in security should not be impair and that on the other the farmer indebte to should not be unduly deprive of home be in accordance with these purpose that the|farm|board by emergency loan to farmer ' cooperative serve to stem panic in agricultural price and save hundreds|of|thousands of farmer and creditor from bankruptcy be in accord with these idea that have create agency to prevent bankruptcy and failure in cooperative organization that be erect new instrumentality to give credit facility for livestock grower and orderly marketing of farm product be in accordance with these principle that in the face of the loom european crisis seek to change the trend of european economic degeneration by proposal of the german moratorium and the standstill agreement on german private debt stem the tide of collapse in germany and the consequent ruin of people in furtherance of world stability have make proposal to reduce the cost of world armament by a year be in accordance with these principle that first secure the creation by private initiative of the|national|credit|association whose effort prevent the failure of hundred of bank and the loss to countless thousand of depositor who have loan all of saving to be in accord with these idea that as the storm grow in intensity create

accelerate during the|past|few|day and relate in part definitely to the financial program of the government there can be no doubt that superimpose upon other cause the long continue delay in the passage of legislation provide for such reduction in expense and such addition to revenue as would balance the budget together with proposal of project which would greatly increase governmental expenditure have give rise to doubt and anxiety as to the ability of government to meet responsibility these fear and doubt have be foolishly exaggerate in foreign country know from bitter experience that the course of unbalanced budget be the road of ruin do not realize that slow as process may be be determined and have the resource to place the finance of the|united|state on an unassailable basis the immediate result have be to create an entirely unjustified run upon the american dollar from foreign country and within the|past|few|day despite national wealth and resource and unparalleled gold reserve dollar stand at a serious discount in the market of the world for the first time in half|a|century this can be and must be immediately correct or the reaction upon economic situation will be such as to cause great loss to people and will still further retard recovery nor be the confusion in public mind and the rise feeling of doubt and fear confine to foreign country reflect directly in diminished economic activity and increase unemployment within own border and among own citizen there be thus further stress upon already diminish and strain economic life of the country no one have a more sympathetic realization than of the difficulty and complexity of the problem with which the congress be confront the decrease in revenue due to the depression by upward of and the consequent necessity to reduce government expenditure the sacrifice such reduction call for from many group and section the further sacrifice call for in the distribution of the remain burden by the imposition of new taxis all constitute a problem which naturally arouse wide divergence of sectional interest and individual view yet if be to secure a just distribution of these sacrifice in such fashion as to establish confidence in the integrity of the government must secure an adjustment of these view to quick and prompt national action direct at sole purpose that be to unfetter the rehabilitation of industry agriculture and unemployment the time have come when must all make sacrifice of some part of particular view and bring these danger and degeneration to halt by expeditious action in the stress of this emergency have confer with member of both party of the senate as to method by which the strain and stress could be overcome and the gigantic resource and energy of people release from the fetter in which be hold have feel in the stress of this emergency a grave responsibility rest upon not only to present the situation to the senate but to make suggestion as to the basis of adjustment between these view which hope will lead to early action and be address to the senate on this occasion as the major question under consideration be now before this body have major duty in legislation in order to accomplish fundamental purpose drastic reduction of expenditure passage of adequate revenue legislation the combination of which with reduction will unquestionably beyond all manner of doubt declare to the world the balancing of the federal budget and the stabilizing of the american dollar passage of adequate relief legislation to assure the country against distress and to aid in employment pende the next session of congress be essential that when ask citizen to undertake the burden of increase taxation must give to evidence of reduction of every expenditure not absolutely vital to the immediate conduct of the government the executive budget of last|december provide for a reduction of expenditure in the|next|fiscal|year over the then estimate expenditure of the|current|year by about|$370|million have recommend to the congress from time to time the necessity for passage of legislation which would give authority for further important reduction in expenditure not possible for consideration by either the executive or the committee of congress without such legislation an earnest nonpartisan effort be make to secure these purpose in a national economy bill in the house but largely fail that subject be under review by the bipartisan committee appoint from the member of the|senate|appropriations|committee and be inform have tentatively agree upon a recommendation which would aggregate saving of together with a number of undetermined further possibility be not inform as to detail of these recommendation although learn that own suggestion in many instance have not be accept but do know that the committee have make honest and earnest effort to reach a just reduction in expenditure and trust therefore that despite any of individual view or the sacrifice of any group that can unite in support and expeditious adoption of the committee 's conclusion in addition to the economy which may be bring about through the economy bill the direct reduction of the appropriation committee should increase this figure to at|least|$400|million not include certain postponement to later deficiency bill as this sum form the basis of calculation as to increase taxis necessary be essential that no matter what the detail may be that amount of reduction must be obtain or taxis must be increase to compensate if this minimum of be attain by congressional action together with the effect through executive budget except for amount already budget for public work in aid to unemployment and increase cost of veteran will have reduce expenditure of this government to the low point since in the matter of tax legislation must face the plain and unpalatable fact that due to the degeneration in the economic situation during the|past|month the estimate of fertility of taxis which have be make from time to time base upon the then current prospect of business must be readjust to take account of the decrease business activity and shrink value the|finance|committee have be advise that the setback of the|past|month now make evident that if be to have absolute assurance of the need income with breadth of base which would make a certainty of the collection must face additional taxis to those now propose by the|senate|finance|committee recognize the complaint that estimate of the taxis require and reduction of expense need have be repeatedly increase but on the other hand should be bear in mind that if tax and economy legislation recommend from time to time since last|december have be promptly enact there would have be less degeneration and stagnation in the country but be unprofitable to argue any such question must face the situation as exist today in the course of the|6|month during which the revenue bill have be consider in the house and senate practically every form of tax have be suggest at time or another many have find way into the bill later to be reject the total amount congress originally set out to obtain have be gradually whittle down either by actual reduction or degeneration of the situation while need have increase if examine the major source of possible increase in taxis now propose and the nature of taxis already vote may well be that the income taxis have already be raise to the point of diminish return through avoidance which will ensue by the use of tax exempt security and be already so high as to approach the danger point in retardation of enterprise be advisable that more relief should be give to earn income nor will further increase in income tax even include the proposal of senator connally cover the gap in revenue or provide against any failure to reduce expense to the full amount have state the senate have already impose a multitude of specific manufacturer excise taxis on special industry some of appear discriminatory and uncertain in productivity have not and do not favor a general sale tax have not be propose by the treasury a sale tax be not however to be confuse with an extension of the special manufacturer excise taxis to a general manufacturer excise tax with exemption of food and clothing this be an entirely different tax from a so call sale tax and can not be pyramid even this general manufacturer excise tax have not be propose by the treasury although at the time such a tax be unanimously recommend by the|ways|and|means|committee of the house represent both political party and leader in the|house|of|representatives the secretary of the treasury accept in the hope that immediate passage of the bill would result in order however to solve problem and give assurance to the country and the world of the impregnability of the american dollar and that be ready to meet emergency at any sacrifice have now come to favor an extension for a limited period of the many special excise taxis to a more general manufacturer excise tax and will support the congress if should be adopt whether this be the course or not some further emergency tax source should be incorporate in the pende bill on may|16,|1932 senator tom|connally oњ texas offer an amendment to the revenue bill provide for income taxis range up|to|55|percent in the high bracket the senate reject the amendment on may|17 third problem be that of relief the sharp degeneration have many reflex in distress and hardship upon people hold that the maintenance of the sense of individual and personal responsibility of man to neighbor and the proper separation of function of the federal and local government require the maintenance of the fundamental principle that the obligation of distress rest upon the individual upon the community and upon the states in order however that there may be no failure on the part of any state to meet obligation in this direction have after consultation with some of the party leader on both side favored authorization to the|reconstruction|finance|corporation to loan up|to|$300|million to state government where be unable to finance in provision of relief to distress such loan should be make by purchase of state bond by the corporation but where state be unable to issue bond then loan should be make upon application of state authority and if be not regularize by the issuance of bond within a period of 12|to|18|month should become a charge upon the federal aid fund to which such state may be entitle in order to aid unemployment and to avoid wasteful expansion of public work have favor an authority to the|reconstruction|corporation to increase issue of security to the maximum of in order that may extend service both in aid to employment and agriculture on a wide scale under the method propose the corporation be to be a authorize to buy bond from political subdivision or public body to aid in construction of income produce or self liquidate project to make loan to establish enterprise upon adequate security for advancement of sound project that will increase employment but safeguard by requirement that some portion of outside capital be also provide c to divert a portion of the unexpended authorization of agricultural loan through the secretary of agriculture to finance export of agricultural product d to make loan to institution upon security of agricultural commodity to assure the carrying of normal stock of these commodity and thus by stabilize loan value to steady price level to make loan to the|federal|farm|board to enable extension of finance of farm cooperative have not be able to favor the expansion of public work beyond the program already propose in the budget have for many|year advocate speed up of public work as relief to unemployment in time of depression since the beginning of this depression in consonance with this view the|federal|government will have expend in excess of in construction and maintenance of kind or another as against a normal program of perhaps for a similar period the budget for next|year call for over|$550|million or double usual outlay if shall now increase these program shall need instantly to increase taxis still further have already force every project which have justification with any regard to the taxpayer and the avoidance of sheer waste be not desire on this occasion to argue the comparative merit of extend such a program and that of finance an even large program of employment on productive work through the|reconstruction|finance|corporation be indeed all desirous of serve fellow citizen who be in difficulty and must serve in such a fashion that do not increase the rank of unemployed may emphasize that this alternative program avoid drain upon the taxpayer and above all if be to balance budget and balance in such fashion that people and the world may know be balance can not make further appropriation in any direction beyond the amount now before the congress be confident that if the congress could find in these suggestion which come from member of both party a ground for adjustment of legislation on those dominant particular and could bring into immediate action would yield not only relief to the country but would reestablish that confidence which so sorely need the natural wealth of this country be unimpaired and the inherent ability of people to meet problem be be restrain by failure of the government to act time be of the essence every day 's delay make new wound and extend come before in sympathy with the difficulty which the problem present and in a sincere spirit of helpfulness ask of to accept such a basis of practical adjustment essential to the welfare of people in hand at this moment be the answer to the question whether democracy have the capacity to act speedily enough to save in emergency the nation urgently need unity need solidarity before the

the emergency of unemployment have be meet by action in many direction the appropriation for the continue speed up of the great federal construction program have provide direct and indirect aid to employment upon a large scale by organized unity of action the states and municipality have also maintain large program of public improvement many industry have be prevail upon to anticipate and intensify construction industrial concern and other employer have be organize to spread available work amongst all employee instead of discharge a portion of a large majority have maintain wage at as high level as the safe conduct of business would permit this course have save from industrial conflict and disorder which have characterize all previous depression immigration have be curtail by administrative action upon the basis of normal immigration the decrease amount to about|300,000 individual who otherwise would have be add to unemployment the expansion of federal employment agency under appropriation by the congress have prove most effective through the president 's organization for unemployment relief public and private agency be successfully mobilize last|winter to provide employment and other measure against distress similar organization give assurance against suffering during the|coming|winter committee of lead citizen be now active at practically every point of unemployment in the large majority have be assure the fund necessary which together with local government aid will meet the situation a few exceptional locality will be further organize the evidence of the|public|health|service show an actual decrease of sickness and infant and general mortality below normal year no great proof could be adduce that people have be protect from hunger and cold and that the sense of social responsibility in the nation have respond to the need of the unfortunate to meet the emergency in agriculture the loan authorize by congress for rehabilitation in the drought area have enable farmer to produce abundant crop in those district the|red|cross undertook and magnificently administer relief for over|2,500,000 drought sufferer last|winter have undertake this|year

purpose and strength by enable farm cooperative to cushion the fall in price of farm product in and the board secure high price to the farmer than would have be obtain otherwise although the benefit of this action be partially defeat by continued world overproduction incident to this action the failure of a large number of farmer and of country bank be avert which could quite possibly have spread into a major disaster the bank in the south have cooperate with the|farm|board in creation of a pool for the well marketing of accumulate cotton grower have be materially assist by this action constant effort have be make to reduce overproduction in relief of agriculture and to promote the foreign buying of agricultural product by sustain economic stability abroad to meet domestic emergency in credit and banking arise from the reaction to acute crisis abroad the|national|credit|association be set up by the bank with resource of to support sound bank against the frightened withdrawal and hoarding be give aid to reopen solvent bank which have be close federal official have bring about many beneficial union of bank and have employ other mean which have prevent many bank closing as a result of these measure the hoarding withdrawal which have rise to over|$250,000,000 per week after the british crisis have substantially cease further measures the major economic force and weakness at home and abroad have now be expose and can be appraise and the time be ripe for forward action to expedite recovery although some of the cause of depression be due to speculation inflation of security and real estate unsound foreign investment and mismanagement of financial institution yet self contain national economy with matchless strength and resource would have enable to recover long since but for the continue dislocation shock and setback from abroad whatever the cause may be the vast liquidation and readjustment which have take place have leave with a large degree of credit paralysis which together with the situation in railway and the condition abroad be now the outstanding obstacle to recuperation if can put financial resource to work and can ameliorate the financial situation in the railway be confident can make a large measure of recovery independent of the rest of the world a strong america be the high contribution to world stability phase of the credit situation be indicate in the bank during bank represent of total deposit have be close a large part of these failure have be cause by withdrawal for hoarding as distinguish from the failure early in the depression where weakness due to mismanagement be the large cause of failure despite closing many of will pay in full although such withdrawal have practically cease yet of currency be previously withdraw which have still to return to circulation this represent a large reduction of the ability of bank to extend credit which would otherwise fertilize industry and agriculture furthermore many of banker in order to prepare to meet possible withdrawal have feel compel to call in loan to refuse new credit and to realize upon security which in turn have demoralize the market the paralysis have be further augment by the steady increase in recent|year of the proportion of bank asset invest in long term security such as mortgage and bond these security tend to lose liquidity in depression or temporarily to fall in value so that the ability of the bank to meet the shock of sudden withdrawal be greatly lessen and the restriction of all kind of credit be thereby increase the continue credit paralysis have operate to accentuate the deflation and liquidation of commodity real estate and security below any reasonable basis of value all of this tend to stifle business especially the small unit and finally express in further depression of price and value in restriction on new enterprise and in increase unemployment the situation largely arise from an unjustified lack of confidence have enormous volume of idle money in the bank and in hoarding do not require more money or work capital need to put what have to work the fundamental difficulty which have bring about financial strain in foreign country do not exist in the|united|state no external drain on resource can threaten position because the balance of international payment be in favor owe less to foreign country than owe to industry be efficiently organized currency and bank deposit be protect by the great gold reserve in history first step toward recovery be to reestablish confidence and thus restore the flow of credit which be the very basis of economic life must put some steel beam in the foundation of credit structure be duty to apply the full strength of government not only to the immediate phase but to provide security against shock and the repetition of the weakness which have be prove the recommendation which here lie before the congress be design to meet these need by strengthen financial industrial and agricultural life through the medium of exist institution and thus to avoid the entry of the government into competition with private business federal government finance the first requirement of confidence and of economic recovery be financial stability of the|united|states|government shall deal with fiscal question at great length in the budget message but must at this time call attention to the magnitude of the deficit which have develop and the result necessity for determined and courageous policy these deficit arise in the main from the heavy decrease in tax receipt due to the depression and to the increase in expenditure on construction in aid to unemployment aid to agriculture and upon service to veteran during the|fiscal|year|ending|june|30 last incur a deficit of about|$903,000,000 which include the statutory reduction of the debt and represent an increase of the national debt by of this however be offset by increase cash balance in comparison with the|fiscal|year|1928 there be indicate a fall in federal receipt for amount to of which be in individual and corporate income taxis alone during this|fiscal|year there will be an increase expenditure as compare to on veteran of and an increase expenditure on construction work which may reach despite large economy in other direction have an indicate deficit include the statutory retirement of the debt of and an indicate net debt increase of about|$1,711,000,000 the|budget|for|the|fiscal|year begin july|1|next after allow for some increase of taxis under the present law and after allow for drastic reduction in expenditure still indicate a deficit of after offset the statutory debt retirement this would indicate an increase in the national debt for the|fiscal|year|1933 of about|$921,000,000 several conclusion be inevitable must have insistent and determined reduction in government expense must face a temporary increase in taxis such increase should not cover the whole of these deficit or will retard recovery must partially finance the deficit by borrowing be view that the amount of taxation should be fix so as to balance the budget for except for the statutory debt retirement such government receipt would assure the balance of the following year 's budget include debt retirement be further view that the additional taxation should be impose solely as an emergency measure terminate definitely year from july|1|next such a basis will give confidence in the determination of the government to stabilize finance and will assure taxpayer of temporary character even with increase taxation the government will reach the utmost safe limit of borrowing capacity by the expenditure for which be already obligate and the recommendation here propose to go further than these limit in either expenditure taxis or borrowing will destroy confidence denude commerce and industry of resource jeopardize the financial system and actually extend unemployment and demoralize agriculture rather than relieve federal land bank recommend that the congress authorize the subscription by the treasury of further capital to the federal land bank to be retire as provide in the original act or when fund be available and that repayment of such capital be treat as a fund available for further subscription in the same manner be urgent that the bank be support so as to stabilize the market value of bond and thus secure capital for the farmer at low rate that may continue service to agriculture and that may meet the present situation with consideration to the farmer deposits in closed bank a method should be devise to make available quickly to depositor some portion of deposit in close bank as the asset of such bank may warrant such provision would go far to relieve distress in a multitude of family would stabilize value in many community and would liberate work capital to thousand of concern recommend that measure be enact promptly to accomplish these result and suggest that the congress should consider the development of such a plan through the|federal|reserve|bank home loan|discount|banks recommend the establishment of a system of home loan discount bank as the necessary companion in financial structure of the|federal|reserve|bank and federal|land|bank such action will relieve present distress pressure against home and farm property owner will relieve pressure upon and give add strength to building and loan association saving bank and deposit bank engage in extend such credit such action would further decentralize credit structure would revive residential construction and employment would enable such loan institution more effectually to promote home ownership discuss this plan at some length in a statement make public november|14 last this plan have be warmly indorse by the recent national|conference|upon|home|ownership|and|housing whose member be designate by the governor of the states and the group interested reconstruction finance corporation in order that the public may be absolutely assure and that the government may be in position to meet any public necessity recommend that an emergency reconstruction|corporation of the nature of the former war|finance|corporation should be establish may not be necessary to use such an instrumentality very extensively the very existence of such a bulwark will strengthen confidence the treasury should be authorize to subscribe a reasonable capital to and should be give authority to issue own debenture should be place in liquidation at the|end|of|two|year purpose be that by strengthen the weak spot to thus liberate the full strength of the nation 's resource should be in position to facilitate export by american agency make advance to agricultural credit agency where necessary to protect and aid the agricultural industry to make temporary advance upon proper security to establish industry railway and financial institution which can not otherwise secure credit and where such advance will protect the credit structure and stimulate employment function would not overlap those of the|national|credit|corporation federal reserve eligibility on october|6th issue a statement that should recommend to the congress an extension during emergency of the eligibility provision in the federal reserve act this statement be approve by a representative gathering of the members of both houses of the congress include member of the appropriate committee be approve by the official of the|treasury|department and understand such an extension have be approve by a majority of the governor of the federal reserve bank nothing should be do which would lower the safeguard of the system the establishment of the mortgage discount bank herein refer to will also contribute to further reserve strength in the bank without inflation banking laws people have a right to a banking system in which deposit shall be safeguard and the flow of credit less subject to storm the need of a sounder system be plainly show by the extent of bank failure recommend the prompt improvement of the banking law changed financial condition and commercial practice must be meet the congress should investigate the need for separation between different kind of banking an enlargement of branch banking under proper restriction and the method by which enlarge membership in the federal reserve system may be bring about postal|savings|bank the postal|saving deposit have increase from about|$200,000,000 to about|$550,000,000 during the|past|year this experience have raise important practical question in relation to deposit and investment which should receive the attention of the congress railway the railway present of immediate and press problem be and must remain the backbone of transportation system prosperity be interrelate with the prosperity of all industry fundamental service in transportation the volume of employment buying power for supply from other industry the enormous investment in security particularly bond by insurance company saving bank benevolent and other trust all reflect partnership in the whole economic fabric through these institution the railway bond be in a large sense the investment of every family the well maintain and successful operation and the stability of railway finance be of primary importance to economic recovery should have more effective opportunity to reduce operating cost by proper consolidation as rate must be regulate in public interest so also approximate regulation should be apply to compete service by some authority the method of regulation should be revise the|interstate|commerce|commission have make important and far reach recommendation upon the whole subject which commend to the early consideration of the congress antitrust laws in message of a|year|ago comment on the necessity of congressional inquiry into the economic action of the antitrust law there be wide conviction that some change should be make especially in the procedure under these law do not favor repeal such action would open wide the door to price fixing monopoly and destruction of healthy competition particular attention should be give to the industry round upon natural resource especially where destructive competition produce great waste of these resource and bring great hardship upon operator employee and the public in recent|year there have be continue demoralization in the bituminous coal oil and lumber industry again commend the matter to the consideration of the congress unemployment as an aid to unemployment be engage in the great program of public building harbor flood control highway waterway aviation merchant and naval ship construction in all history expenditure on these work during this|calendar|year will reach about|$780,000,000 compare with in through this increase construction through the maintenance of a full complement of federal employee and through service to veteran be estimate that the federal taxpayer be now directly contribute to the livelihood of of citizen must avoid burden upon the government which will create more unemployment in private industry than can be gain by further expansion of employment by can now stimulate employment and agriculture more effectually and speedily through the voluntary measure in progress through the thawing out of credit through the building up of stability abroad through the home loan discount bank through an emergency finance corporation and the rehabilitation of the railway and other such direction be oppose to any direct or indirect

important bearing upon the emergency problem with which be confront shipping board at present the|shipping|board exercise large administrative function independent of the executive these administrative function should be transfer to the|department|of|commerce in keep with that single responsibility which have be the basis of governmental structure since foundation there should be create in that department a position of assistant secretary for merchant|marine under whom this work and the several bureaus have to do with merchant marine may be group the|shipping|board should be make a regulatory body act also in advisory capacity on loan and policy in keep with original conception regulatory power should be amend to include regulation of coastwise shipping so as to assure

privation this nation pass through valley|forge and come to yorktown transcript great britain be departure from the gold standard the president have be ask by of member to discuss something of the british demonetization or departure from the gold standard can only do that by way of background can not make a public statement in the matter think will understand that this situation have be pende for a|good|many|months there have be a large amount of british investment in the|united|state and that amount estimate by the|department|of|commerce aggregate something over that be not flight of capital but steadily increase expenditure here which naturally affect the exchange have take place not only in the|past|few|month but for some|year back that of course have affect the problem of exchange there have be some pile up of immediate cash in bank from that|quarter the course resolve upon by the|british|government create some temporary dislocation in the international world but be due more to the confusion arise out of readjustment of quotation and value than in effect on the value of either security or commodity the first effect of the decrease in the gold value of the pound be a rise in price of commodity in great|britain at least in all international commodity where the price be make by international action such as in wheat and other raw material there be involve a large amount of transaction base on the readjustment of those price a certain amount of confusion come out of that and the effect on commodity market have be a decrease in price there have be a rise in price in england in consequence and price be practically unchanged yesterday and today the fact that the pound be take off fixed value of be not the abandonment of the gold standard even for the pound as international commerce revolve in these|days all transaction will be measure in some gold value whether in dollar franc gulden or any other of the fix gold currency no transaction can take place unless have some basis of measurement of that character really mean that the fix gold standard have be abandon and a variable standard adopt which may change momentarily but in any event all value in international commerce be bind to revolve on gold value or some measure stick in gold be more or less a case of abandon a fix standard and adopt a variable one so far as international commerce be concern the effect in england will undoubtedly be to increase export which amount to price reduction compare with the standard of measurement in gold and should act as a stimulant and thus should increase employment and increase the demand again for raw material obviously amount to a reduction in standard of live temporarily in those commodity which be import of course raw material but wage and rank will lag behind production cost will be low and consequently export will be stimulate the tendency also may be to decrease import to some extent especially for highly competitive good on the export side the effect be not go to be very material on the|united|state because there be comparatively small volume of british and american good which be highly competitive in neutral market a study make some time ago of the argentine show that there be only|about|10|percent of the export of the|united|state to the argentine and correspondingly of the british export to the argentine that be competitive be export good which can peculiarly produce to the good advantage and may mean competition in respect to that small fraction over toward the neutral market but would not be any appreciable volume there may be some decrease in import into great|britain especially in luxury but trade with great|britain consist largely of raw material and manufacture good if there be stimulation of british export export would be more likely to increase than decrease mention that only to indicate that the effect of be not as far reach as some people may think on the financial side there be no consequential balance of american bank in england will always have sufficient of own capital so there be no loss there of any consequence at all all together the action no doubt necessary on the british side be not feel go to have any great effect in the|united|state the probability be that will considerably improve the situation in england and will benefit in the long run in any event when there be a question pende over the world 's economic life the actual realization of be much less severe on than be the constant possibility of such as have be the case for the|past|3|or|4|month all together if be go to have an important economic shift be well to have over than to have hang about will realize also that this be not the first time that the pound have be off the gold basis do not know of any nation in the world which manage to maintain through national life the gold value of currency there be a long period in the|united|state after when certainly could not maintain the pound be off the gold basis from some point in the war to or afterwards but gradually the economic situation readjust these thing be temporary and go back again to original position and that be all have

purpose of this action be to give the|forthcoming|year to the economic recovery of the world and to help free the recuperative force already in motion in the|united|state from retard influence from abroad the worldwide depression have affect the country of europe more severely than own some of these country be feel to a serious extent the drain of this depression on national economy the fabric of intergovernmental debt supportable in normal time weigh heavily in the midst of this depression from a variety of cause arise out of the depression such as the fall in the price of foreign commodity and the lack of confidence in economic and political stability abroad there be an abnormal movement of gold into the|united|state which be lower the credit stability of many foreign country these and the other difficulty abroad diminish buying power for export and in a measure be the cause of continued unemployment and continue low price to farmer wise and timely action should contribute to relieve the pressure of these adverse force in foreign country and should assist in the reestablishment of confidence thus forward political peace and economic stability in the world authority of the president to deal with this problem be limit as this action must be support by the congress have be assure the cordial support of lead member of both party in the senate and the house the essence of this proposition be to give time to permit debtor government to recover national prosperity be suggest to the american people that be wise creditor in own interest and be good neighbor wish to take this occasion also to frankly state view upon relation to german reparation and the debt owe to by the|allied|governments|of|europe government have not be a party to or exert any voice in determination of reparation obligation purposely do not participate in either general reparation or the division of colony or property the repayment of debt due to from the allies for the advance for war and reconstruction be settle upon a basis not contingent upon german reparation or relate thereto therefore reparation be necessarily wholly a european problem with which have no relation do not approve in any remote sense of the cancellation of the debt to world confidence would not be enhance by such action none of debtor nation have ever suggest but as the basis of the settlement of these debt be the capacity under normal condition of the debtor to pay should be consistent with own policy and principle if take into account the abnormal situation now exist in the world be sure the american people have no desire to attempt to extract any sum beyond the capacity of any debtor to pay and be view that broad vision require that government should recognize the situation as exist this course of action be entirely consistent with the policy which have hitherto pursue be not involve in the discussion of strictly european problem of which the payment of german reparation be represent willingness to make a contribution to the early restoration of world prosperity in which own people have so deep an interest wish further to add that while this action have no bearing on the conference for limitation of land armament to be hold next|february inasmuch as the burden of competitive armament have contribute to bring about this depression trust that by this evidence of desire to assist shall have contribute to the good will which be so necessary in the solution of this major question transcript to return herewith without approval h.r.|17054 an act to increase the loan basis of adjust service certificate in order that may be clearly understand may review that the adjust compensation act bonus bill pass on may|19,|1924 award to veteran approximately|$1,365,000,000 further compensation for war service to this sum be add say to be consideration for defer the payment until about|1945 the whole bear compound interest immediate payment to dependent upon death be include thus create an endowment insurance policy represent by a certificate to each veteran show the sum payable at the end of the period the face value the total face value of the outstanding certificate to day after pay the sum due of less|than|$50 and payment in full to dependent be hold by veteran or an average of each the burden upon the country be to be an amount each year sufficient as a yearly premium to provide for the payment of the face value of these certificate in about|1945 and to date have involve an appropriation average per annum the accumulation of these appropriation be represent by government obligation deposit in a reserve fund which fund now amount to about|$750,000,000 a loan basis to certificate holder be establish equal to of the reserve value of the certificate such loan now in the|sixth|year be authorize to of the face value when the bonus act be pass be upon the explicit understanding of the congress that the matter be close and the government would not be call upon to make subsequent enlargement be now propose to enlarge the loan rate to of the face value at a low rate of interest thus impose a potential cash outlay upon the government of about|$1,700,000,000 if all veteran apply for loan less about|$330,000,000 already loan accord to the administrator of veterans ' affairs the probable number who will avail of the privilege under this bill will require approximately|$1,000,000,000 there not be a penny in the treasury to meet such a demand the government must borrow this sum through the sale of the reserve fund security together with further issue or must need impose further taxation the sole appeal make for the reopening of the bonus act be the claim that fund from the|national|treasury should be provide to veteran in distress as the result of the drought and business depression there be veteran unemployed and in need to day in common with many other of people these like the other be be provide the basic necessity of life by the devoted committee in those part of the country affect by the depression or drought the government and many employer be give preference to veteran in employment welfare be and should be a matter of concern to people inquiry indicate that such care be be give throughout the country and also indicate that the number of veteran in need of such relief be a minor percentage of the whole the utility of this legislation as relief to those in distress be far less than have be disclose the popular assumption have be that as the certificate average then each veteran can obtain by way of a loan but this be only an average and half will receive less than this amount in fact man will be able to borrow less|than|$200 and of these over will be able to borrow only an average of furthermore there be veteran whose certificate have be issue recently who under the propose law will have no loan privilege until certificate be two|years|old be therefore urgent in any event that local committee continue relief to veteran but this legislation would lead such local committee and employer to assume that these veteran have be provide for by the|federal|treasury and thereby threaten with great hardship than before the breach of fundamental principle in this proposal be the requirement of the|federal|government to provide an enormous sum of money to a vast majority who be able to care for and who be care for among those who would receive the propose benefit be include veteran and dependent who be already receive some degree of allowance or support from the|federal|government but in addition to these provide equal benefit for score of thousand of other who be in the income tax pay class and for score of thousand who be hold secure position in the federal state and local government and in every profession and industry know that most of these man do not seek these privilege have no desire to be present to the american people as benefit by a burden put upon the whole people and have many manifestation from veteran on whom the time be bear hardly that do not want to be represent to people as a group substitute special privilege for the idealism and patriotism have rejoice in offer to country through service be suggest as a reason for make these provision applicable to all veteran that should not make public distinction between veteran in need and the other who comprise the vast majority lest characterize those deserve help as a pauper class on the contrary veteran in need be and should be a preferred class that a grateful country would be proud to honor with support adoption of the principle of aid to the rich or to those able to support in set up a group of special privilege among citizen the principle that the nation should give generous care to those veteran who be ill disabled in need or in distress even though these disability do not arise from the war have be fully accept by the nation pension or allowance have be provide for the dependent of those who lose life in the war allowance have be provide to those who suffer disability from the war additional allowance be pass at the last session of congress to all the veteran whose earn power at any time may be permanently impair by injury or illness free hospitalization be available not only to those suffer from the result of war but to large number of temporarily ill together with war risk insurance and the adjust compensation these service now total an annual expenditure of approximately|$600,000,000 and under exist law will increase to per in a|very|few|years for world|war veteran alone a total of five|thousand|millions|of|dollar have be expend upon such service since the war country have thus show sense of obligation and generosity and readiness at all time to aid those of veteran in need have the utmost confidence that service man would be amongst the first to oppose a policy of government assistance to veteran who have property and mean to support for service man be as devoted to the welfare of country in peace as in war and as clearly foresee the future danger of embark on such a policy could but create resentment which would ultimately react against those who should be give care be argue that the distribution of the|hundreds|of|millions|of|dollar propose by this bill would stimulate business generally can not further the restoration of prosperity by borrow from some of people pledge the credit of all of the people to loan to some of people who be not in need of the money if the exercise of these right be limit to expenditure upon necessity only there would be no stimulation to business the theory of stimulation be base upon the anticipation of wasteful expenditure can be of no assistance in the return of real prosperity if this argument of proponent be correct should make government loan to the whole people be represent that this measure merely provide loan against a future obligation and that therefore will cost the american people nothing that be an incomplete statement a cost at once arise to the people when instead of proceed by annual appropriation the government be force to secure a huge sum by borrowing or otherwise especially in the circumstance of to day when be compel in the midst of depression to make other large borrowing to cover deficit and refund operation an increase rate of interest which the government must pay upon all long term issue be inevitable impose an additional burden of interest on the people which will extend through the whole term of such loan some cost arise to the people through the tendency to increase the interest rate which every state and municipality must pay in borrowing for public work and improvement as well as the rate which industry and business must pay there be a cost to someone through the retardation of the speed of recovery of employment when government borrowing divert the saving of the people from use by constructive industry and commerce impose a great charge upon the individual who lose such increase employment or continue unemployed to the veteran this be a double loss when have consume the value of certificate and have also lose the opportunity for great earning there be a great cost than all this be a step toward government aid to those who can help these direct or indirect burden fall upon the people as a whole the need of people to day be a decrease in the burden of taxis and unemployment yet who include the veteran be be steadily force toward high tax level and lessen employment by such act as this must not forget the million of hard work family in country who be strive to pay the debt which have incur in acquire home and farm in endeavor to build protection for future in the last analysis must bear the burden of increase government aid and taxis be not the rich who suffer when take employment and taxis from people be the poor who suffer there be a very serious phase of this matter for the wife and child of veteran and to the future security of veteran each of these certificate be an endowment insurance policy any money advance against together with interest will be automatically deduct from the value of the certificate in case of death or upon maturity no one will deny that under the pressure or allurement of the moment many will borrow against these certificate for other than absolutely necessary purpose the loss to many family mean the destruction of the safeguard at most critical time can not be contend that the interest of the family of country be conserve by either cash or borrow upon life insurance policy have no desire to present monetary aspect of the question except so far as affect the human aspect surely be a human aspect to transfer to the back of those who toil include veteran a burden of those who by position and property can care for be a human aspect to incur the danger of continue or increase unemployment be a human aspect to deprive woman and child of protection by reckless use of an endowment policy country be rich enough to do any justice no country be rich enough to do an injustice the patriotism of people be not a material thing be a spiritual thing can not pay for with government aid can honor those in need by aid and be a fundamental aspect of freedom among that no step should be take which burden the nation with a privileged class who can care for regard the bill under consideration as unwise from the standpoint of the veteran and unwise from the standpoint of the welfare of all the people the future of world|war veteran be inseparably bind up with the future of the whole people the great service that can render both veteran and the public generally be to administer the affair of government with a view to the well being and happiness of all of the nation the matter under consideration be of grave importance in but of much graver importance be the whole tendency to open the|federal|treasury to a purpose many admirable in intention but in which the proponent fail or do not care to see that with such beginning many of insidiously consume more and more of the saving and the labor of people in aggregate threaten burden beyond the ability of country normally to bear and of far high importance each of break the barrier of self reliance and self support in people transcript the president say certain senators have issue a public statement to the effect that unless the president and the|house|of|representatives agree to appropriation from the|federal|treasury for charitable purpose will force an extra session of congress do not wish to add acrimony to a discussion but would rather state this case as see fundamental this be not an issue as to whether people shall go hungry or cold in the|united|state be solely a question of the good method by which hunger and cold shall be prevent be a question as to whether the american people on hand will maintain the spirit of charity and mutual self help through voluntary giving and the responsibility of local government as distinguish on the other hand from appropriation out of the|federal|treasury for such purpose own conviction be strongly that if break down this sense of responsibility of individual generosity to individual and mutual self help in the country in time of national difficulty and if start appropriation of this character have not only impair something infinitely valuable in the life of the american people but have strike at the root of self government once this have happen be not the cost of a|few|score|million but be face with the abyss of reliance in future upon government charity in some form or other the money involve be indeed the least of the cost to american ideal and american institution president cleveland in confront with a similar issue state in part a prevalent tendency to disregard the limited mission of this power and duty should think be steadfastly resist to the end that the lesson should be constantly enforce that though the people support the government the government should not support the people the friendliness and charity of countryman can always be rely upon to relieve fellow citizen in misfortune this have be repeatedly and quite lately demonstrate federal aid in such case encourage the expectation of paternal care on the part of the government and weaken the sturdiness of national character while prevent the indulgence among people of that kindly sentiment and conduct which strengthen the bond of a common brotherhood and there be a practical problem in all this the help be daily extend by neighbor by local and national agency by municipality by industry and a great multitude of organization throughout the country today be many time any appropriation yet propose the opening of the door of the|federal|treasury be likely to stifle this giving and thus destroy far more resource than the propose charity from the|federal|government the basis of successful relief in national distress be to mobilize and organize the infinite number of agency of self help in the community that have be the american way of relieve distress among own people and the country be successfully meet problem in the american way today have entirely separate and distinct situation in the country the first be the drought area the second be the unemployment in large industrial center for both of which these appropriation attempt to make charitable contribution immediately upon the appearance of the drought last|august convoke a meeting of the governors the|red|cross and the railway the banker and other agency in the country and lay the foundation of organization and the resource to stimulate every degree of self help to meet the situation which be then obvious would develop the result of this action be to attack the drought problem in a number of direction the|red|cross establish committee in every drought county comprise the lead citizen of those county with instruction to that be to prevent starvation among neighbor and if the problem go beyond local resource the|red|cross would support the organization have stretch throughout the area of suffering the people be be care for today through the hand and with sympathetic understanding and upon the responsibility of neighbor who be be support in turn by the fine spirit of mutual assistance of the american people the red|cross official whose long devoted service and experience be unchallenged inform this|morn that except for the minor incident of any emergency organization no one be go hungry and no one nee go hungry or cold to reinforce this work at the opening of congress recommend large appropriation for loan to rehabilitate agriculture from the drought and provision of further large sum for public work and construction in the drought territory which would give employment in further relief to the whole situation these federal activity provide for an expenditure of upward of in this area and be in progress today the|red|cross have always meet the situation which have undertake after careful survey and after actual experience of several|month with part of the problem have announce firmly that can command the resource with which to meet any call for human relief in prevention of hunger and suffer in drought area and that accept this responsibility have refuse to accept federal appropriation as not be consonant either with the need or the character of organization the government department have give and be give every assistance possibly need to strengthen the|public|health|service in matter of sanitation and to strengthen the credit facility of that area through the method approve by the government department to divert some exist appropriation to strengthen agricultural credit corporation in the matter of unemployment outside of the drought area important economic measure of mutual self help have be develop such as those to maintain wage to distribute employment equitably to increase construction work by industry to increase federal construction work from a rate of about|$275|million a year prior to the depression to a rate now of over|$750|million a year to expand state and municipal construction all upon a scale never before provide or even attempt in any depression but beyond this to assure that there shall be no suffering in every town and county voluntary agency in relief of distress have be strengthen and create and generous fund have be place at disposal be carry on work efficiently and sympathetically but after and coincidently with voluntary relief american system require that municipal county and state government shall use own resource and credit before seek such assistance from the|federal|treasury have indeed spend much of life in fight hardship and starvation both abroad and in the|southern|states do not feel that should be charge with lack of human sympathy for those who suffer but recall that in all the organization with which have be connect over these|many|years the foundation have be to summon the maximum of self help be proud to have seek the help of congress in the past for nation who be so disorganize by war and anarchy that self help be impossible but even these appropriation be but a tithe of that which be coincidently mobilize from the public charity of the|united|state and foreign country there be no such paralysis in the|united|state and be confident that people have the resource the initiative the courage the stamina and kindliness of spirit to meet this situation in the way have meet problem over generation will accredit to those who advocate federal charity a natural anxiety for the people of states be willing to pledge that if the time should ever come that the voluntary agency of the country together with the local and state government be unable to find resource with which to prevent hunger and suffer in country will ask the aid of every resource of the|federal|government because would no more see starvation amongst countryman than would any senator or congressman have the faith in the american people that such a day will not come the american people be do job today should be give a chance to show whether wish to preserve the principle of individual and local responsibility and mutual self help before embark on what believe be a disastrous system feel sure will succeed if give the opportunity the whole business situation would be greatly strengthen by the prompt completion of the necessary legislation of this session of congress and thereby the unemployment problem would be lessen the drought area indirectly benefit and the resource of self help in the country strengthen transcript the president say observe that measure have be already introduce in congress and be have advocacy which if pass would impose an increase expenditure beyond the sum which have recommend for the present and next|fiscal|year by a total of nearly|$4,500|million and mostly under the guise of give relief of some kind or another the gross sum which have recommend to carry on the essential function of the government include the extreme sum which can be apply by the|federal|government in actual emergency employment or relief and be the maximum which can be finance without increase in taxis no matter how devise an increase in taxis in the end fall upon the worker and farmer or alternatively deprive industry of that much ability to give employment and defeat the very purpose of these scheme for the government to finance by bond issue deprive industry and agriculture of just that much capital for own use and for employment prosperity can not be restore by raid upon the|public|treasury the leader of both party be cooperate to prevent any such event some of these scheme be ill consider some represent enthusiast and some represent the desire of individual to show that be more generous than the administration or that be more generous than even the leader of own party be play politic at the expense of human misery many of these measure be be promote by organization and agency outside of congress and be push upon members of congress some of be mistake as to the result will accomplish and be all mistaken as to the ability of the|federal|government to undertake such burden some of these outside agency be also engage in promote political purpose the american people will not be mislead by such tactic transcript to the senate and house|of|representatif have the honor to comply with the requirement of the constitution that should lay before the congress information as to the state of the union and recommend consideration of such measure as be necessary and expedient substantial progress have be make during the|year in national peace and security the fundamental strength of the nation 's economic life be unimpaired education and scientific discovery have make advance country be more alive to problem of moral and spiritual welfare economic situation during the|past|12|month have suffer with other nations from economic depression the origin of this depression lie to some extent within own border through a speculative period which divert capital and energy into speculation rather than constructive enterprise have overspeculation in security be the only force operating should have see recovery many months|ago as these particular dislocation have generally readjust other deep seat cause have be in action however chiefly the world wide overproduction beyond even the demand of prosperous time for such important basic commodity as wheat rubber coffee sugar copper silver zinc to some extent cotton and other raw material the cumulative effect of demoralize price fall of these important commodity in the process of adjustment of production to world consumption have produce financial crisis in many country and have diminish the buying power of these country for import good to a degree which extend the difficulty farther afield by create unemployment in all the industrial nation the political agitation in asia revolution in and political unrest in some european|state the method of sale by russia of increase agricultural export to european market and own drought have all contribute to prolong and deepen the depression in the large view the major force of the depression now lie outside of the|united|state and recuperation have be retard by the unwarranted degree of fear and apprehension create by these outside force the extent of the depression be indicate by the follow approximate percentage of activity during the|past|three|months as compare with the highly prosperous year of value of department store sale % of volume of manufacture production % of volume of mineral production % of volume of factory employment % of total of bank deposit % of wholesale price all commodity % of cost of live % of various other index indicate total decrease of activity from of from per cent there be many factor which give encouragement for the future the fact that be hold from to per cent of normal activity and income that major financial and industrial institution have come through the storm unimpaire that price level of major commodity have remain approximately stable for some time that a number of industry be show sign of increase demand that the world at large be readjust to the situation all reflect ground for confidence should remember that these occasion have be meet many time before that be but temporary that country be to day strong and rich in resource in equipment in skill than ever in history be in an extraordinary degree self sustain will overcome world influence and will lead the march of prosperity as have always do hitherto economic depression can not be cure by legislative action or executive pronouncement economic wound must be heal by the action of the cell of the economic body the producer and consumer recovery can be expedite and effect mitigate by cooperative action that cooperation require that every individual should sustain faith and courage that each should maintain self reliance that each and every one should search for method of improve business or service that the vast majority whose income be unimpaired should not hoard out of fear but should pursue normal living and recreation that each should seek to assist neighbor who may be less fortunate that each industry should assist own employee that each community and each state should assume full responsibility for organization of employment and relief of distress with that sturdiness and independence which build a great nation people be respond to these impulse in remarkable degree the good contribution of government lie in encouragement of this voluntary cooperation in the community the government national state and local can join with the community in such program and do part a|year|ago together with other officer of the government initiate extensive cooperative measure throughout the country the first of these measure be an agreement of lead employer to maintain the standard of wage and of labor leader to use influence against strife in a large sense these undertaking have be adhere to and have not witness the usual reduction of wage which have always heretofore mark depression the index of union wage scale show to be today fully up to the level of any of in consequence the buying power of the country have be much large than would otherwise have be the case of equal importance the nation have have unusual peace in industry and freedom from the public disorder which have characterize previous depression the second direction of cooperation have be that government national state and local the industry and business so distribute employment as to give work to the maximum number of employee the third direction of cooperation have be to maintain and even extend construction work and betterment in anticipation of the future have be the universal experience in previous depression that public work and private construction have fall off rapidly with the general tide of depression on this occasion however the increase authorization and generous appropriation by the congress and the action of states and municipality have result in the expansion of public construction to an amount even above that in the|most|prosperous|years in addition the cooperation of public utility railway and other large organization have be generously give in construction and betterment work in anticipation of future need the|department|of|commerce advise that as a result the volume of this type of construction work which amount to roughly|$6,300,000,000 in instead of decrease will show a total of about|$7,000,000,000 for there have of course be a substantial decrease in the type of construction which could not be undertake in advance of need the fourth direction of cooperation be the organization in such state and municipality as be deem necessary of committee to organize local employment to provide for employment agency and to effect relief of distress the result of magnificent cooperation throughout the country have be that actual suffering have be keep to a minimum during the|past|12|month and unemployment have be far less in proportion than in other large industrial country some time ago become evident that unemployment would continue over the|winter and would necessarily be add to from seasonal cause and that the saving of workpeople would be more largely deplete have as a nation a definite duty to see that no deserve person in country suffer from hunger or cold therefore set up a more extensive organization to stimulate more intensive cooperation throughout the country there have be a most gratifying degree of response from governor mayor and other public official from welfare organization and from employer in concern both large and small the local community through voluntary agency have assume the duty of relieve individual distress and be be generously support by the public the number of those wholly out of employment seek for work be accurately determine by the census last|april as about|2,500,000 the|department|of|labor index of employment in the large trade show some decrease in employment since that time the problem from a relief point of view be somewhat less than the publish estimate of the number of unemployed would indicate the intensive community and individual effort in provide special employment outside the list industry be not reflect in the statistical index and tend to reduce such publish figure moreover there be estimate to be a constant figure at all time of nearly|1,000,000 unemployed who be not without annual income but temporarily idle in the shift from job to another have an average of about|three breadwinner to each family so that every person unemployed do not represent a family without income the view that the relief problem be less than the gross number would indicate be confirm by the experience of several city which show that the number of family in distress represent from 10|to|20 per cent of the number of the calculated unemployed this be not say to minimize the very real problem which exist but to weigh actual proportion as a contribution to the situation be engage upon the great program of waterway harbor flood control public building highway and airway improvement in all history this together with loan to merchant shipbuilder improvement of the navy and in military aviation and other construction work of the government will exceed for this|fiscal|year this compare with in the construction work already authorize and the continuation of policy in government aid will require a continual expenditure upwards of half|a|billion|dollar annually favor still further temporary expansion of these activity in aid to unemployment during this|winter the congress will however have present to number of project some of under the guise of rather than the reality of usefulness in the increase of employment during the depression there be certain commonsense limitation upon any expansion of construction work the government must not undertake work that be not of sound economic purpose and that have not be subject to search technical investigation and which have not be give adequate consideration by the congress the volume of construction work in the government be already at the maximum limit warrant by financial prudence as a continue policy to increase taxation for purpose of construction work defeat own purpose as such taxis directly diminish employment in private industry again any kind of construction require after authorization a considerable time before labor can be employ in which to make engineering architectural and legal preparation immediate problem be the increase of employment for the|next|six|month and new plan which do not produce such immediate result or which extend commitment beyond this period be not warrant the enlarged river and harbor public building and highway plan authorize by the congress last session however offer an opportunity for assistance by the temporary acceleration of construction of these program even faster than originally plan especially if the technical requirement of the law which entail great delay could be amend in such fashion as to speed up acquirement of land and the letting of contract with view however to the possible need for acceleration immediately upon receive those authority from the congress begin the necessary technical work in preparation for such possible eventuality have canvass the department of the government as to the maximum amount that can be properly add to present expenditure to accelerate all construction during the|next|six|month and feel warrant in ask the congress for an appropriation of from to provide such further employment in this emergency in connection therewith need some authority to make enlarged temporary advance of federal highway aid to the states recommend that this appropriation be make distributable to the different department upon recommendation of a committee of the cabinet and approval by the president application to work already authorize by the congress assure use in direction of economic importance and to public welfare such action will imply an expenditure upon construction of all kind of over|$650,000,000 during agriculture the world wide depression have affect agriculture in common with all other industry the average price of farm produce have fall to about|80|per|cent of the level of this average be however greatly affect by wheat and cotton which have participate in world wide overproduction and have fall to about|60|per|cent of the average price of the|year|1928 exclude these commodity the price of all other agricultural product be about|84|per|cent of those of the average wholesale price of other primary good such as nonferrous metal have fall to of the price level of major agricultural commodity be in fact high than those in other principal produce country due to the combined result of the tariff and the operation of the|farm|board for instance wheat price at minneapolis be about|30|per|cent high than at winnipeg and at chicago be about|20|per|cent high than at buenos|aires corn price at chicago be over twice as high as at wool price average more|than per cent high in this country than abroad and butter be high in new|york|city than in copenhagen aside from the misfortune to agriculture of the world wide depression have have the most severe drought have affect particularly the states border on the potomac ohio and lower|mississippi|river with some area in montana kansas oklahoma and texas have find major expression in the shortage of pasturage and a shrinkage in the corn crop from an average of about|2,800,000,000|bushel to about|2,090,000,000|bushels on august|14 call a conference of the governor of the most acutely

have appoint state committee representative of the farmer banker business man and the|red|cross and subsidiary committee have be establish in most of the acutely affect county railway rate be reduce on feed and livestock in and out of the drought area and over|50,000 car of such product have be transport under these reduce rate the|red|cros establish a preliminary fund of for distress relief purpose and establish agency for administration in each county of this fund have be call for up to this time as the need will appear more largely during the|winter the|federal|farm|loan|board have extend credit facility and the|federal|farm|board have give financial assistance to all affect cooperative in order that the government may meet full obligation toward countryman in distress through no fault of own recommend that an appropriation should be make to the|department|of|agriculture to be loan for the purpose of seed and feed for animal application should as hitherto in such loan be limit to a gross amount to any individual and secure upon the crop the|red|cross can relieve the case of individual distress by the sympathetic assistance of people finance of the government shall submit the detailed financial position of the government with recommendation in the usual budget message will at this time however mention that the budget estimate of receipt and expenditure for the|current|year be formulate by the treasury and at a time when be impossible to forecast the severity of the business depression and have be most seriously affect by at that time a surplus of about|$123,000,000 be estimate for this|fiscal|year and tax reduction which affect the|fiscal|year to the extent of be authorize by the congress thus reduce the estimate surplus to about|$48,000,000 closely revise estimate now make by the treasury and the|bureau|of|the|budget|of|the|tax postal and other receipt for the|current|fiscal|year indicate a decrease of about|$430,000,000 from the estimate of a|year|ago of which about|$75,000,000 be due to tax reduction leave about|$355,000,000 due to the depression moreover legislation enact by congress subsequent to the submission of the budget|enlarging|federal construction work to expand employment and for increase in veteran ' service and other item have increase expenditure during the|current|fiscal|year by thus the decrease of in revenue and the increase of in expenditure adversely change the original budget situation by about|$655,000,000 this large sum be offset by the original estimate surplus a|year|ago of by the application of of interest payment upon the foreign debt to current expenditure by arrangement of the|farm|board through repayment in consequence of which reduce net cash demand upon the treasury by in this period and by about|$67,000,000 economy and deferment bring about in the government thus reduce the practical effect of the change in the situation to an estimate deficit of about|$180,000,000 for the|present|fiscal|year shall make suggestion for handle the present year deficit in the budget message but do not favor encroachment upon the statutory reduction of the public debt while will be necessary in public interest to further increase expenditure during the|current|fiscal|year in aid to unemployment by speed up construction work and aid to the farmer affect by the drought can not emphasize too strongly the absolute necessity to defer any other plan for increase of government expenditure the budget for indicate estimate expenditure of about|$4,054,000,000 include postal deficit the receipt be estimate at about|$4,085,000,000 if the temporary tax reduction of last|year be discontinue leave a surplus of only|about|$30,000,000 most rigid economy be therefore necessary to avoid increase in taxis national|defense army and navy be be maintain at a high state of efficiency under officer of high training and intelligence support by a devoted personnel of the rank and file the london naval treaty have bring important economy in the conduct of the navy will lay before the committee of the congress recommendation for a program of authorization of new construction which should be initiate in the|fiscal|year|of|1932 legislation this be the last session of the|seventy first|congress during previous sitting have complete a very large amount of important legislation notably the establishment of the|federal|farm|board fix congressional reapportionment revision of the tariff include the flexible provision and a reorganization of the|tariff|commission reorganization of the|radio|commission reorganization of the|federal|power|commission expansion of federal prison reorganization of parole and probation system in federal prison expansion of veteran ' hospital

treaty the congress have before legislation partially complete in the last sitting in respect to muscle|shoal bus regulation relief of congestion in the court reorganization of border patrol in prevention of smuggling law enforcement in and other subject be desirable that these measure should be complete the short session do not permit of extensive legislative program but there be a number of question which if time do not permit action recommend should be place in consideration by the congress perhaps through committee cooperate in some instance with the federal department with view to preparation for subsequent action among be the following subject electrical power have in a previous message recommend effective regulation of interstate electrical power such regulation should preserve the independence and responsibility of the states railway have determine upon a national policy of consolidation of the railway as a necessity of more stable and more economically operate transportation further legislation be necessary to facilitate such consolidation in the public interest should strengthen the railway that may meet future need antitrust laws recommend that the congress institute an inquiry into some aspect of the economic working of these law do not favor repeal of the|sherman|act the prevention of monopoly be of most vital public importance competition be not only the basis of protection to the consumer but be the incentive to progress however the interpretation of these law by the court the change in business especially in the economic effect upon those enterprise closely relate to the use of the natural resource of the country make such an inquiry advisable the producer of these material assert that certain unfortunate result of wasteful and destructive use of these natural resource together with a destructive competition which impoverish both operator and worker can not be remedie because of the prohibitive interpretation of the antitrust law the well know condition of the bituminous coal industry be an illustration the people have a vital interest in the conservation of natural resource in the prevention of wasteful practice in condition of destructive competition which may impoverish the producer and the wage earner and have an equal interest in maintain adequate competition therefore suggest that an inquiry be direct especially to the effect of the working of the antitrust law in these particular field to determine if these evil can be remedie without sacrifice of the fundamental purpose of these law capital gains tax be urge by many thoughtful citizen that the peculiar economic effect of the income tax on so call capital gain at the present rate be to enhance speculative inflation and likewise impede business recovery believe this to be the case and recommend that a study be make of the economic effect of this tax and of relation to the general structure of income tax law immigration there be need for revision of immigration law upon a more limited and more selective basis flexible to the need of the country under condition of current unemployment be obvious that person come to the|united|state seek work would likely become either a direct or indirect public charge as a temporary measure the officer issue visa to immigrant have be in pursuance of the law instruct to refuse visa to applicant likely to fall into this class as a result the visa issue have decrease from an average of about|24,000 per month prior to restriction to a rate of during the|last|month these be largely prefer person under the law visas from mexico be about|250 per month compare to about|4,000 previous to restriction the whole subject require exhaustive reconsideration deportation of alien criminal urge the strengthening of deportation law so as to more fully rid of criminal alien furthermore thousand of person have enter the country in violation of the immigration law the very method of entry indicate objectionable character and law abide foreign bear resident suffer in consequence recommend that the congress provide method of strengthen the government to correct this abuse post|office due to deferment of government build over many year previous administration have be compel to enter upon type of lease for secondary facility in large city some of which be objectionable as represent too high a return upon the value of the property to prevent the occasion for further uneconomic leasing recommend that the congress authorize the building by the government of own facility veterans the nation have generously expand care for veteran the consolidation of all veteran ' activity into the|veterans'|administration have produce substantial administrative economy the consolidation also bring emphasis to the inequality in service and allowance the whole subject be under study by the administrator and recommend should also be examine by the committee of the congress social|service urge further consideration by the congress of the recommendation make a|year|ago look to the development through temporary federal aid of adequate state and local service for the health of child and the further stamp out of communicable disease particularly in the rural section the advance of scientific discovery method and social thought impose a new vision in these matter the drain upon the|federal|treasury be comparatively small the result both economic and moral be of the utmost importance general be belief that after the passing of this depression when can examine in retrospect shall need to consider a number of other question as to what action may be take by the government to remove possible governmental influence which make for instability and to better organize mitigation of the effect of depression be as yet too soon to constructively formulate such measure there be many administrative subject such as departmental reorganization extension of the civil service readjustment of the postal rate which at some appropriate time require the attention of the congress foreign relation relation with foreign country have be maintain upon a high basis of cordiality and good will during the|past|year the london naval pact be complete approve by the senate and ratify by the government concern by this treaty have abolish competition in the building of warship have establish the basis of parity of the|united|state with the strong of foreign power and have accomplish a substantial reduction in war vessel during the|year there have be an extended political unrest in the world asia continue in disturb condition and revolution have take place in brazil argentina peru and bolivia despite the jeopardy to citizen and property which naturally arise in such circumstance have with the cooperation of the government concern be able to meet all such instance without friction have resume normal relation with the new government of brazil argentina peru and bolivia immediately upon evidence that be able to give protection to citizen and property and that recognize international obligation a commission which be support by the congress have complete investigation and report upon future policy in respect to haiti and prove of high value in secure the acceptance of these policy an election have be hold and a new government establish have replace high commissioner by a minister and have begin the gradual withdrawal of activity with view to complete retirement at the expiration of the present treaty in a number of arbitration and conciliation treaty have be complete or negotiate during the|year and will be present for approval by the senate shall in a special message lie before the senate the protocol cover the statute of the|world|court which have be revise to accord with the sense of previous senate reservation transcript member of the|american|bankers|association and guest be glad to meet with this assembly of representative banker from every state and almost every county of country during the|past|year have carry the credit system of the nation safely through a most difficult crisis in this success have demonstrate not alone the soundness of the credit system but also the capacity of banker in emergency have have a severe shock and there have be disorganization in economic system which have temporarily check the march of prosperity but the fundamental asset of the nation the education intelligence virility and the spiritual strength of people have be unimpaire the resource of country in land and mine be undiminished scientific discovery and invention have make further progress the gigantic equipment and unparalleled organization for production and distribution be in many part even strong than though production and consumption have be slow down to or of normal yet by the very fact of the steady functioning of the major portion of system do have the assurance of ability and the economic strength to overcome the decline the problem today be to complete the restoration of order in rank and to intensify effort to prevent such interruption for the future and be not a problem in academic economic be a great human problem the margin of shrinkage bring loss of saving unemployment privation hardship and fear which be no part of ideal for the american economic system this depression be worldwide cause and effect lie only partly in the|united|state country engage in overspeculation in security which crash a|year|ago with great loss a perhaps even large immediate cause of depression have be the effect upon from the collapse in price follow overproduction of important raw material mostly in foreign country particularly have the planting of rubber coffee wheat sugar and to a less extent cotton expand beyond world consumption even in normal time the production of certain metal such as silver copper and zinc have likewise be overexpande these major over expansion have take place largely outside of the|united|state collapse have reduce the buying power of many country the prosperity of brazil and colombia have be temporarily affect from the situation in coffee chile peru mexico and australia from the fall in silver zinc and copper the buying power of india and china dependent upon the price of silver have be affect australia canada and the argentine have be affect by the situation in wheat cuba and java have be depress by the condition of the sugar industry east|india generally have suffer from the fall in rubber these and other cause have produce in some of the country affect some political unrest these economic disturbance have echo in slow down demand for manufacture good from europe and with inevitable contribution to unemployment but the readjustment in price which be also inevitable be far along course most of these commodity be below the level at which sufficient production can be maintain for the world 's normal need and therefore sooner or later must recover because the present depression be worldwide and because cause be worldwide do not require that should wait upon the recovery of the rest of the world can make a very large degree of recovery independently of what may happen elsewhere should like to remind that do precisely that thing in be then experience the result of the collapse of war inflation in all commodity and in every direction have less organize cooperation between the business community and the government to help mitigate that situation the rest of the world be in chaos from the war far more menacing both to economic and political stability than anything confront today difficulty at that time be far more severe than be at present the commercial bank particularly be sufferer from a large volume of frozen credit and enjoy nothing to compare with the comfortable liquidity that prevail today then have overexpansion and large stock in most commodity today with or exception be free from this deterrent but lead the world in recovery be independent recuperation from that depression and the economic strength which so liberally and largely furnished to other country that be the very basis for reconstruction of a war demoralize world be able in considerable degree to free of world influence and make a large measure of independent recovery because be so remarkably self contain because of this while economic system be subject to the shock of world influence should be able in large measure to readjust national production be over|one third of the total of the whole commercial world consume an average of about|90|percent of own production of commodity if for example assume a restore normal home consumption and hold even present reduced basis of export should be upon a of normal business basis even this illustration do not represent all of self contain strength shall need mainly to depend upon own strong arm for recovery as other nation be in great difficulty than shall need again to undertake to assist and cooperate with import of commodity in the main depend upon domestic prosperity any forward movement in recovery create a demand for foreign raw material and good and thus instantly react to assist other country the world over wish to take time to discuss some of the pivotal relationship of the banker not only to the immediate problem of recovery but to the wide problem of long view business stability any discussion of the one involve the other before enter upon that subject however wish to say that no one can occupy the high office of president and conceivably be other than completely confident of the future of the|united|state perhaps as to no other place do the cheerful courage and power of a confident people reflect as to office there be a few folk in business and several folk in the political world who resent the notion that thing will ever get well and who wish to enjoy temporary misery to recount to these person the progress of cooperation between the people and the government in amelioration of this situation or to mention that be suffer far less than other country or that saving be pile up in the bank or that people be pay off installment purchase that abundant capital be now press for new venture and employment only inspire the unkind retort that should fix gaze solely upon the unhappy feature of the decline and above all to chide the pessimism of person who have assume the end of those mighty force which for have drive this land further and further toward that great human goal the abolition of intellectual and economic poverty be perhaps not a sympathetic approach nevertheless always have be and remain an unquenchable believer in the resistless dynamic power of american enterprise this be no time an audience of american leader of business be no place to talk of any surrender have know a temporary setback but the spirit of this people will never brook defeat present situation be not a new experience these interruption to the orderly march of progress have be recurrent for a|century and apart from recovery from the present depression the most urgent undertaking in economic life be to devise further method of prevent these storm must assure a high degree of business stability for the future the cause advance for these movement be many and varied there be no simple explanation this be not an occasion for analysis of the many theory such as too little gold or the inflexible use of whatever the remote cause may be a large and immediate cause of most hard time be inflationary boom these strike some segment of economic life somewhere in the world and reecho destructive result bring depression and hard time these inflation in currency or credit in land or security or overexpansion in some sort of commodity production beyond possible demand even in good time may take place at home or abroad but all bring retribution the leader of business of economic thought and of government have for the|last|decade give earnest search into cause and remedy of this sort of instability much have already be accomplish to check the violence of the storm and to mitigate distress as a result of these effort the period of stable prosperity between storm be long the period of storm be short and the relief work far more effective but need not go beyond situation today to confirm the need for further effort the economic fatalist believe that these crisis be inevitable and bind to be recurrent would remind these pessimist that exactly the same thing be once say of typhoid cholera and smallpox if medical science have sit down in a spirit of weak kneed resignation and accept these scourge as uncontrollable visitation of providence should still have with this be not the spirit of modern science science gird with painstaking research to find the nature and origin of disease and to devise method for prevention that should be attitude toward these economic pestilence be not dispensation of providence be confident in the faith that control so far as the cause lie within own boundary be within the genius of modern business have all be much engage with measure of relief from the effect of the collapse of a|year|ago at that time determine that be duty even without precedent to call upon the business of the country for coordinated and constructive action to resist the force of disintegration the business community the banker labor and the government have cooperate in wide spread measure of mitigation than have ever be attempt before banker and have carry the country through the credit storm without impairment lead business concern have sustain wage have distribute employment have expedite heavy construction the government have expand public work assist in credit to agriculture and have restrict immigration these measure have maintain a high degree of consumption than would have otherwise be the case have thus prevent a large measure of unemployment have provide much new employment present experience in relief should form the basis of even more amplified plan in the future but in the long view the equally important thing be prevention would need have less concern about what to do in bad time if discover and erect in good time further safeguard against the excess which lead to these depression american business have prove capacity to solve some great human problem in economic the relation between employer and employee have here reach a more stable and satisfactory basis than anywhere else in the world have largely solve the problem of how to secure the consumption of the gigantic increase of good produce through that multiplication of per production by the application of science and the use of laborsave device that solution have be attain by share the saving in production cost between labor capital and the consumer through increase wage and salary to the worker and decrease price to the consumer with consequent increase buying power for still more good every step in that solution be a revolution from the old theory of business may safely assume that economic future be safe so far as be dependent upon a competent handling of problem of productivity but result be to render further advance toward stability even more urgent because with high standard of live the whole system be more sensitive and the penalty of instability more widespread there be no group of which the public expect so much in assure stability as the banker because in the vortex of these storm many value lose mooring nor can any other group contribute so much in constructive thought and action to solve the problem either today or in the long run most important relationship to these business movement lie in the banker 's field the first be what for lack of well term call psychology both that contagious overoptimism which accelerate the inflation of the boom and those depth of fear and pessimism which deepen and prolong the depression the american banker have come to occupy a unique position in the strategy of stability for be the economic adviser of american business be the listen post of economic movement in large measure make or temper psychology do not suppose the banker have consciously seek this new function of general adviser but such have become business be no longer the simple function of discount commercial bill and lend money on first mortgage that be today but part of work these|day when establish a line of credit to a business or furnish loan upon security of a business or advise investment in a business must know the element which make for success and failure of that business and must form judgment as to the future trend of business in general on the other side the american businessman big and little the farmer and the labor leader be come more and more to consult with the banker on problem of business whatever the origin of position may be the banker be now the economic guide philosopher and friend of customer and philosophy can dampen enthusiasm and equally can lift courage and hope the second point of the banker 's unique position in relation to business trend lie in the part which credit play in the whole business process obviously during the inflationary period the use of credit for unwise expansion and speculation draw away the supply of credit from normal business impose upon normal business an interest rate which strangle the orderly commerce of the country commerce sicken under this pressure pace slacken and contribute to collapse therefore wish to emphasize what have long be recognize that is that the flow of credit can accelerate and can retard such movement equally a wise direction of credit provide a large contribution to recovery from depression the third reason why this be so much a banker 's problem be that banking be the great line of business activity that be in interconnect each credit institution share the credit burden of other and all be largely coordinate through national organization the|federal|reserve|system the|reserve|system and member bank and the treasury participation in fact form a widespread cooperative organization act in the broad interest of the whole people to a large degree can influence the flow of credit banker be represent at each stage of management and in addition the various board and advisory committee represent also industry agriculture merchandising and the government the|reserve|system therefore furnish an admirable center for cooperation of the banking business with the production and distribution industry and the government in the development of broad and detached policy of business stability have gain much experience from the great crisis of recent|years trust will seriously and systematically consider what further effective measure can be take either in the business world or in cooperation with the government in development of such policy both for the present depression and for the future know of no great public service be a service to every businessman to every farmer to every worker whether at the desk or bench be not assume can do all or that all disturbance domestic or foreign can be wholly prevent or cure the government should cooperate play a large part in the credit structure of the country fiscal system have most important bearing for instance believe an inquiry may develop that system of taxis upon capital gain directly encourage inflation by strangle the free movement of land and security the regulatory function of the|federal|and|state|government also have a bearing on this subject through effect upon the financial strength of the railway and utility during a period of depression the sound and most available method of relief to unemployment be expansion of public work and construction in the utility railway and heavy industry the volume of possible expansion of construction in these private industry be about|four|or|five time that in public work during the present depression these industry have do full part but especially the railway have be handicap by some provision of the|transportation|act|of|1920 with wide public vision the railway could be strengthen into a great balance wheel of stability have need to consider all of economic legislation whether banking utility or agriculture or anything else from the point of view of effect upon business stability have never believe that form of government could satisfactorily solve economic problem by direct action could successfully conduct business institution the government can and must cure abuse what the government can do best be to encourage and assist in the creation and development of institution control by citizen and evolve by from own need and own experience and direct in a sense of a trusteeship of public interest the|federal|reserve be such an institution without intrusion the government can sometimes give leadership and serve to bring together divergent element and secure cooperation in development of idea measure and institution that be a reenforcement of individualism do not cripple the initiative and enterprise of people by the substitution of government proper cooperation among people in public interest and continuation of such institutional growth strengthen the whole foundation of the nation for self government outside of political government be the true form of self government be in this manner that these problem should be meet and solve wish to revert to the influence of the banker through encouragement and leadership in expedition of recovery from the present situation have already do much and at this juncture the responsibility of those in control of money and credit be very great without faith on part and without good office the early return to full prosperity can not be accomplish this depression will be shorten largely to the degree that feel that can prudently by counsel and specific assistance instill into client from industry agriculture and commerce a feeling of assurance know that of the prerequisite of end a depression be an ample supply of credit at low rate of interest this supply and these rate be now available through the cooperation of the bank and the|federal|reserve|system the income of a large part of people be not reduce by the depression but be affect by unnecessary fear and pessimism the result of which be to slacken the consumption of good and discourage enterprise here the very atmosphere of office will affect the mental attitude and if please courage of the individual who will depend upon for both counsel and money many perhaps all of have be through other period of depression those of who have have occasion to review the experience of the past will believe join in the thought that there come a time in every depression when the change attitude of the financial agency can help the upward movement in economic force start with the premise that this question of stability be much more than a problem in academic economic be a great human problem for involve the happiness of million of home a continued unity of effort both in present situation and in establish safeguard for the future be the need of today no one can contribute more than banking community appear from the press that someone suggest in discussion that american standard of living should be lower to that emphatically disagree do not believe represent the view of this association not only do not accept such a theory but on the contrary the whole purpose and ideal of this economic system which be distinctive of country be to increase the standard of live by the adoption and the constantly widen diffusion of invention and discovery amongst the whole of people any retreat from american philosophy of constantly increase standard of living become a retreat into perpetual unemployment and the acceptance of a cesspool of poverty for some large part of people economic system be but an instrument of the social advancement of the american people be an instrument by which add to the security and richness of life of every individual by no means comprise the whole purpose of life but be the foundation upon which can be build the finer thing of the spirit increase in enrichment must be the objective of the nation not decrease in conclusion would again profess own undaunted faith in those mighty spiritual and intellectual force of liberty self government initiative invention and courage which have throughout whole national life motivate progress and drive ever forward these force which express the true genius of people be undiminished have already show ability to resist this immediate shock any recession in american business be but a temporary halt in the prosperity of a great people transcript to the senate in request the senate to convene in session for the special purpose of deal with the treaty for the limitation and reduction of naval armament sign at london april|22,|1930 be desirable that should present view upon this be especially necessary because of misinformation and misrepresentation which have be widespread by those who in reality be oppose to all limitation and reduction in naval arm must naturally expect opposition from those group who believe in unrestricted military strength as an objective of the|american|nation indeed find the same type of mind in great|britain and japan in parallel opposition to this treaty nevertheless be convince that the overwhelming majority of the american people be oppose to the conception of these group people believe that military strength should be hold in conformity with the sole purpose of national defense earnestly desire real progress in limitation and reduction of naval arm of the world and aspiration be for abolition of competition in the building of arm as a step toward world peace such a result can be obtain in no other way than by international agreement the present treaty be which hold these safeguard and advance these ideal ratification be in the interest of the|united|state be fair to the other participate nation promote the cause of good relation the only alternative to this treaty be the competitive building of navy with all flow of suspicion hate ill will and ultimate disaster history support those who hold to agreement as the path to peace every naval limitation treaty with which be familiar from the rush bagot agreement of limit vessel of war on the|great|lakes to the washington arm treaty of have result in a marked growth of good will and confidence between the nation which be party to be folly to think that because be the rich nation in the world can out build all other country other nation will make any sacrifice to maintain instrument of defense against and shall eventually reap in hostility and ill will the full measure of the additional burden which may thus impose upon the very entry of the|united|state into such course as this would invite the consolidation of the rest of the world against and bring peace and independence into jeopardy have only to look at the state of europe in to find ample evidence of the futility and danger of competition in arm will be remember that in response to recommendation from the senate a conference between the|united|state great|britain and japan for limitation of those category of naval arm not cover by the washington treaty of be hold at geneva in that conference fail because the|united|states could not agree to the large size of fleet demand by other government the standard set up at that time would have require an ultimate fleet of about|1,400,000|ton for the|united|state as against this the total united|stat fleet set out under this treaty will be about|1,123,000|ton defense be the primary function of government and therefore first concern in examination of any act of this character be the test of adequacy in defense no critic have yet assert that with the navy provide in this agreement together with army aerial defense and national resource can not defend and certainly want for the purpose of domination of other nation naval defense position under this treaty be the more clear if examine present naval strength in comparison to the present strength of the other nation and then examine the improvement in this proportion which will result from this treaty this improvement arise from the anticipation of parity in battleship to be reach hence under the washington arm treaty and the fact that other nation have be build in the class of ship not limit by that treaty while until lately lag behind on the|1st|of|january last the total naval tonnage disregard paper fleet and take only those ship actually build and building be for the united|state 1,180,000|ton for 1,332,000|ton for japan that is if the|united|states|navy be take as then the british|navy equal and the japanese navy under this treaty the|united|state will have 1,123,000|ton great|britain 1,151,000|ton and japan or a ratio of for the|united|state to for great|britain and for japan the slightly large tonnage ratio mention for great|britain be due to the fact that cruiser fleet will be constitute more largely of small vessel weak in gun power but the|united|states have the option to duplicate the exact tonnage and gun caliber of the british cruiser fleet if desire to exercise the relative improvement in the position of the|united|state under this treaty be even well than this statement would indicate in the more important category battleship aircraft carrier and cruiser that is omit the secondary arm of destroyer and submarine the fleet build and actually build on january|1 of this|year be in the|united|state 1,088,000|ton in great|britain and in japan or upon the basis of for the|united|state be for great|britain and for japan under this treaty the|united|state will on january|1,|1937 possess complete of these major unit great|britain 948,000|ton and japan in addition the|united|states will have cruiser third complete this will give a ratio in these category of for the|united|state to for great|britain and for japan the reason for the excess british tonnage be again as mention above in other word the|united|state in these category increase by great|britain decrease by and japan decrease by 12,000|ton these readjustment of unit be to take place during the|next|six|year the treaty then come to an end except for such arrangement as may be make then for continuance the major discussion have be direct almost wholly to the fact that the|united|stat be to have cruiser arm with gun with an aggregate tonnage of as against great|britain 's such ship with a tonnage of and japan 's such ship of a tonnage of the|united|state supplement this tonnage with cruiser arm with gun up to a total of great|britain up to and japan to the large gross tonnage to great|britain as state be compensation for the large gun caliber of the american cruiser fleet but as say the|united|states have the option to duplicate the british fleet if so desire criticism of this arrangement arise from the fact that of the united states navy recommend that to reach parity with great|britain the|united|state should have more of the cruiser instead of with gun and a total of or less total cruiser tonnage than this treaty provide thus this treaty provide that instead of this|30,000|ton more of ship recommend by will have 38,000|ton of ship arm with gun there be no limitation upon the size of cruiser up|to|10,000|tons therefore criticism revolve around less than per cent of whole fleet and even within this|3|per|cent come the less question of whether 30,000|ton of ship arm with gun be better|than|38,000|ton armed with gun the opinion of high naval authority be divide on the relative merit of these alternative many earnestly believe that the large tonnage of ship be more advantageous and other vice versa however those who seek to make this the outstanding feature of criticism fail to mention that under the london treaty the obligation of the washington arm treaty of be so altered that great|britain scrap of battleship arm with gun scrap 70,000|ton of battleship arm with 12-inch gun and japan scrap these arrangement be make not only for reduction of arm but to anticipate the ultimate parity between the|united|state and great|britain in battleship which would not otherwise be realize for several|year there be in this provision a relative gain in proportion compare with the british fleet of 63,900|ton of battleship with 13|1/2-inch gun this be of vastly more importance than the dispute as to the relative combatant strength of 38,000|ton of cruiser against 30,000|ton of cruiser indeed would seem that such criticism must be base upon an undisclosed desire to break down all limitation of arm to those who seek earnestly and properly for reduction in warship would point out that as compare with january|1|of|this|year the total aggregate navy of the power under this treaty will have be reduce by nearly|300,000|ton have a settlement be make at geneva in upon the only proposal possible at that time the fleet of the power would have be approximately|680,000|ton great than under the treaty now in consideration the economic burden and the diversion of taxis from welfare purpose which would be impose upon and other nation by failure of this treaty be worth consideration under provision the replacement of battleship require under the washington arm treaty of be postpone for six|year the cost of replace and maintain the scrap battleship be save likewise make economy in construction and operation by the reduction in submarine and destroyer fleet to 52,700|and|150,000|ton respectively what the possible saving over an otherwise inevitable era of competitive building would be no one can estimate if assume that present naval program except for this treaty be to complete the ship authorize by congress and those authorize and necessary to be replace under the washington arm treaty and to maintain a destroyer fleet of about|225,000|ton and a submarine fleet of 90,000|ton such a fleet will not reach parity with great|britain yet would cost in construction over|$500,000,000 more during the|next|six|year than the fleet provide under this treaty but in addition to this as state there be a very large saving by this treaty in annual operation of the fleet over what would be the case if even build no more than the present program the more selfish minded will give little credence to the argument that saving by other party to the agreement in the limitation of naval construction be of interest to the american people yet the fundamental economic fact be that if the resource of these other nation be free for devotion to the welfare of people and to pacific purpose of reproductive commerce will result in blessing to the world include if be to accept the geneva conference base as the end of naval strength under competitive building for the government the saving in construction and operation by the treaty be literally billions|of|dollar the question before now be not whether shall have a treaty with either more cruiser or less cruiser or whether shall have a large reduction in tonnage be whether shall have this treaty or no treaty be a question as to whether shall move strongly toward limitation and reduction in naval arm or whether shall have no limitation or reduction and shall enter upon a disastrous period of competitive armament this treaty do mark an important step in disarmament and in world peace be important for many reason that should be deal with at once the subject have be under discussion since the geneva conference the line of this treaty have be know and under discussion since last|summer the actual document have be before the american people and before the senate for nearly|three|months have be favorably report by the|senate|foreign|relations|committee every solitary fact which affect judgment upon the treaty be know and the document comprise the sole obligation of the|united|state if fail now the world will be again plunge backward from progress toward peace transcript shall approve the tariff bill this legislation have now be under almost continuous consideration by congress for nearly|15|month be undertake as the result of pledge give by at kansas|city declaration embrace these obligation the|republican|party believe that the home market build up under the protective policy belong to the american farmer and pledge support of legislation which will give this market to to the full extent of ability to supply there be certain industry which can not now successfully compete with foreign producer because of low foreign wage and a low cost of live abroad and pledge the next republican congress to an examination and where necessary a revision of these schedule to the end that the american labor in these industry may again command the home market may maintain standard of living and may count upon steady employment in accustomed field platform promise must not be empty gesture in message of april|16,|1929 to the special session of the congress accordingly recommend an increase in agricultural protection a limited revision of other schedule to take care of the economic change necessitate increase or decrease since the enactment of the law and further recommend a reorganization both of the|tariff|commission and of the method of execute the flexible provision a statistical estimate of the bill by the|tariff|commission show that the average duty collect under the law be of the value of all import both free and dutiable while if the new law have be apply would have increase this percentage to this compare with the average level of the tariff under the mckinley law of % the wilson law of % the dingley law of % the payne aldrich law of % the fordney mccumber law of % under the underwood law of the amount be disturb by war condition vary to the proportion of import which will be free of duty under the new law be estimate at from this compare with average under the mckinley law of % the wilson law of % the dingley law of % the payne aldrich law of % the fordney mccumber law of % under the underwood law of disturb condition vary the free list from to averaging the increase in tariff be largely direct to the interest of the farmer of the increase be state by the|tariff|commission that be upon product of agricultural origin measure in value as distinguish from upon commodity of strictly nonagricultural origin the average rate upon agricultural raw material show an increase from to in contrast to dutiable article of strictly other than agricultural origin which show an average increase of from to compensatory duty have necessarily be give on product manufacture from agricultural raw material and protective rate add to these in some instance the extent of rate revision as indicate by the|tariff|commission be that in value of the total import the duty upon have be increase and be untouched or decrease by number of the dutiable item mention in the bill out of the total of about|3,300 there be about|890 increase decrease and untouched the number of item increase be therefore of all dutiable item and compare with of the number of item which be increase in the revision this tariff law be like all other tariff legislation whether frame primarily .upon a protective or a revenue basis contain many compromise between sectional interest and between different industry no tariff bill have ever be enact or ever will be enact under the present system that will be perfect a large portion of the item be always adjust with good judgment but be bind to contain some inequality and inequitable compromise there be item upon which duty will prove too high and other upon which duty will prove to be too low certainly no president with other duty can pretend to make that exhaustive determination of the complex fact which surround each of those item and which have require the attention of hundred of man in congress for that responsibility must rest upon the congress in a legislative rate revision on the administrative side have insist however that there should be create a new basis for the flexible tariff and have be incorporate in this law thereby the mean be establish for objective and judicial review of these rate upon principle lay down by the congress free from pressure inherent in legislative action thus the outstanding step of this tariff legislation have be the reorganization of the largely inoperative flexible provision of into a form which should render possible to secure prompt and scientific adjustment of serious inequity and inequality which may prove to have be incorporate in the bill this new provision have even a large importance if a perfect tariff bill be enact today the increase rapidity of economic change and the constant shifting of relation to industry abroad will create a continuous stream of item which would work hardship upon some segment of the american people except for the provision of this relief without a workable flexible provision would require even more frequent congressional tariff revision than during the past with the country should be free from further general revision for many|year to come congressional revision be not only disturb to business but with all necessary collateral surrounding in lobby log roll and the activity of group interest be disturb to public confidence under the old flexible provision the task of adjustment be impose directly upon the president and the limitation in the law which circumscribe be such that action be long delay and be largely inoperative although important benefit be bring to the dairying flax glass and other industry through the new flexible provision establish the responsibility for revision upon a reorganize tariff|commission compose of member equal of both party as a definite rate make body act through semi - judicial method of open hearing and investigation by which item can be take up by upon direction or upon application of aggrieved party recommendation be to be make to the president be give authority to promulgate or veto the conclusion of the commission such revision can be accomplish without disturbance to business as concern but item at a time and the principle lay down assure a protective basis the principle of a protective tariff for the benefit of labor industry and the farmer be establish in the bill by the requirement that the commission shall adjust the rate so as to cover the difference in cost of production at home and abroad and be authorize to increase or decrease the duty by to effect this end the mean and method of ascertain such difference by the commission be provide in such fashion as should expedite prompt and effective action if grievance develop when the flexible principle be first write into law in by tradition and force of habit the old conception of legislative revision be so firmly fix that the innovation be bind to be use with caution and in a restricted field even have not be largely inoperative for other reason now however and particularly after the record of the|last|15|months there be a grow and widespread realization that in this highly complicated and intricately organize and rapidly shift modern economic world the time have come when a more scientific and businesslike method of tariff revision must be devise toward this the new flexible provision take a long step these provision meet the repeat demand of statesman and industrial and agricultural leader over the|past|25|year comply in full degree with the proposal make by president roosevelt now cover proposal which urge in if however by any chance the flexible provision now make should prove insufficient for effective action shall ask for further authority for the commission for believe that public opinion will give wholehearted support to the carrying out of such a program on a generous scale to the end that may develop a protective system free from the vice which have characterize every tariff revision in the past the complaint from some foreign country that these duty have be place unduly high can be remedie if justify by proper application to the|tariff|commission be urgent that the uncertainty in the business world which have be add to by the long extend debate of the measure should be end can be end only by completion of this bill meritorious demand for further protection to agriculture and labor which have develop since the tariff of would not end if this bill fail of enactment agitation for legislative tariff revision would necessarily continue before the country nothing would contribute to retard business recovery more than this continue agitation as have say do not assume the rate structure in this or any other tariff bill be perfect but be convince that the disposal of the whole question be urgent believe that the flexible provision can within reasonable time remedy inequality that this provision be a progressive advance and give great hope of take the tariff away from politic lobbying and log roll that the bill give protection to agriculture for the market of product and to several industry in need of such protection for the wage of labor that with return normal condition foreign trade will continue to expand transcript in message of june|6th|and|december|3rd,|1929 place before congress the urgency of certain improvement necessary to effective criminal law enforcement substantial progress have be make upon some of the measure propose yet be near the end of the present session and can not too strongly urge the necessity of action upon all these recommendation before adjournment the most important recommendation make by be in number there should be a transfer of the function of detection and prosecution of prohibition case from the|treasury|department to the|department|of|justice and thus an ending of divided responsibility and effort an act provide for this transfer be pass by the|house|of|representatives and have now be report to the senate by judiciary|committee there must be relief afford from congestion in the court while this congestion be evidence by the docket in many court full implication be not show by the so call bargain|day when light fine be impose as the result of plea of guilty clear the docket but the result distinctly undermine respect for law no conclusion appear to have be reach as to the method of accomplish this either by the|judiciary|committee|of|the|senate or by the|judiciary|committee|of|the|house|of|representatif there must be extension of federal prison with more adequate parole system and other modern treatment of prisoner have already prisoner in federal

that purpose have be introduce and hearing have be hold before the|senate|district|committee should contain the safeguard recommend by the attorney general have within the limit of exist legislation improve the personnel and greatly increase the efficiency of the exist federal machinery in criminal law enforcement during the|past|year the above reform be necessary however if be to perform the high duty which fail upon the executive of enforcement of the federal law while a considerable part of this condition arise from the law relate to intoxicate liquor yet the law relate to narcotic automobile theft which have be enact by the congress during recent|years also contribute to create the present condition this be well indicate by the fact that less|than|one|third of federal prisoner be due to prohibition obedience to law law enforcement and judicial organization judicial procedure care and method of handle prisoner in relation to not only federal government but also to the state and municipal government be far from the standard that must be secure these proposal while do not comprehend the whole which remain to be do in the nation be a step toward lift the federal standard

from the measure which have be in progress since the|last|of|november to reduce unemployment and the hardship follow the dislocation from the stock exchange crash the survey be not as yet complete there be however certain conclusion that be evident unemployment amount to distress be in the main concentrate in state the authority in the remain state indicate only normal seasonal unemployment or that the minor abnormal unemployment be be rapidly absorb the low point of business and employment be the latter part of december and early|january since that time employment have be slowly increase and the situation be much well today than at that time nationwide response to the request for increase construction and improvement work by public authority railroad utility and industry be have a most material effect construction contract in these category in january and february be from to high than ever know in those|months the total construction work for seem assure to be large than even the undertaking to maintain wage have be hold the amount of unemployment be in proportion to the number of worker considerably less than half probably only|one third of that which result from the crash of and at this period of the situation measure take to ameliorate interest rate have result in continuous decrease since december and money be available at low rate for business and commercial purpose result be an increase volume of bond issue have be place for public improvement available money for mortgage purpose of home building and agriculture have lag behind other form of credit but a decrease in demand of policyholder for loan on the insurance company and the action recently take by the|federal|reserve|system should result in increase supply of credit especially for residential building which in turn have lag behind other construction all the evidence indicate that the bad effect of the crash upon employment will have be pass during the|next|60|day with the amelioration of seasonal unemployment the gaining strength of other force and the continue cooperation of the many agency actively cooperate with the government to restore business and to relieve distress transcript

have make liberal provision for the establishment of suitable quarter for foreign staff in the different country in order however that may further develop the most effective force in this of the most responsible function of government shall recommend to the congress more liberal appropriation for the work of the|state|department know of no expenditure of public money from which a great economic and moral return can come to than by assure the most effective conduct of foreign relation national|defense to preserve internal order and freedom from encroachment be the first purpose of government army and navy be be maintain in a most efficient state under officer of high intelligence and zeal the extent and expansion of number and equipment as at present authorize be ample for this purpose can well be deeply concerned however at the grow expense from a total expenditure for national defense purpose in of naturally rise with the|great|war but recede again to in when again begin to rise until during the|current|fiscal|year the expenditure will reach to over|$730,000,000 exclude all civilian service of those department program now authorize will carry to still large figure in future|year while the remuneration pay to soldier and sailor be justly at a high rate than that of any other country in the world and while the cost of subsistence be high yet the total of expenditure be in excess of those of the most highly militarize nation of the world upon the conference shortly to be hold in london will depend such moderation as can make in naval expenditure if shall be compel to undertake the naval construction imply in the washington arm treaty as well as other construction which would appear to be necessary if no international agreement can be complete shall be commit during the|next|six|year to a construction expenditure of upward of besides the necessary further increase in cost for annual upkeep after the various army contingent necessarily expand to the end of the|great|war and then recede to the low point in when expansion again begin in the officer and man in regular force both army and navy be about|164,000 in there be about|256,000 and in there be about|250,000 citizen ' army however include the|national|guard and other form of reserve increase these total up to about|299,000 in about|672,000 in and in under the kellogg pact have undertake never to use war as an instrument of national policy have therefore undertake by covenant to use these equipment solely for defensive purpose from a defense point of view force should be proportion to national need and should therefore to some extent be modify by the prospect of peace which be never bright than to day should be bear in mind that the improvement in the|national|guard|by|federal support begin in have definitely strengthen national security by render far more effective than ever heretofore the advance of aviation have also greatly increase effectiveness in defense in addition to the very large program of air force which be maintain in the army and navy there have be an enormous growth of commercial aviation this have provide unanticipated reserve in manufacturing capacity and in industrial and air personnel which again add to security recommend that congress give earnest consideration to the possibility of prudent action which will give relief from continuously mount expenditure finance of the government the finance of the government be in sound condition shall submit the detailed evidence and the usual recommendation in the special budget message may however summarize position the public debt on june|30|this|year stand at compare to the maximum in august,|1919 of since june|30 have be reduce by a further in the budget to be submit the total appropriation recommend for be as compare to for the|present|fiscal|year however include for the|federal|farm|board as to which no estimate can as yet be determine for owe to the many necessary burden assume by congress in previous|year which now require large outlay be with extreme difficulty that shall be able to keep the expenditure for the|next|fiscal|year within the bound of the|present|year economy in many direction have permit some accommodation of press need the net result be an increase as show above of about|one tenth of above can not fail to recognize the obligation of the government in support of the public welfare but must coincidentally bear in mind the burden of taxis and strive to find relief through some tax reduction every dollar so return fertilize the soil of prosperity tax reduction the estimate submit to by the secretary of the treasury and the budget director indicate that the government will close the|fiscal|year|1930 with a surplus of about|$225,000,000 and with a surplus of about|$123,000,000 owe to unusual circumstance have be extremely difficult to estimate future revenue with accuracy believe however that the congress will be fully justify in give the benefit of the prospective surplus to the taxpayer particularly as ample provision for debt reduction have be make in both|year through the form of debt retirement from ordinary revenue in view of the uncertainty in respect of future revenue and the comparatively small size of the indicate surplus in relief should take the form of a provisional revision of tax rate recommend that the normal income tax rate applicable to the income of individual for be reduce from and per cent to and ½ per cent and that the tax on the income of corporation for be reduce from to per cent be estimate that this will result in a reduction of in income taxis to be collect during the loss in revenue will be divide approximately equally between|the|fiscal|years|1930|and|1931 such a program will give a measure of tax relief to the maximum number of taxpayer with relatively large benefit to taxpayer with small or moderate income foreign debt the|past|year have bring near to completion of settlement of the indebtedness of foreign government to the|united|state the act of congress approve february|4,|1929 authorize the settlement with the government of austria along line similar to the term of settlement offer by that government to other relief creditor no agreement have yet be conclude with that government but the form of agreement have be settle and execution only await the government|of|austria secure the assent by all the other relief creditor of the term offer the act of congress approve february|14,|1929 authorize the settlement with the|government|of|greece and an agreement be conclude on may|10,|1929 the government of france ratify the agreement with on july|27,|1929 this agreement will shortly be before the congress and recommend approval the only indebtedness of foreign government to the|united|state now unsettled be that of russia and armenia during the|past|year a committee of distinguished expert under american leadership submit a plan look to a revision of claim against germany by the various government the|united|state deny any participation in the war settlement of general reparation and claim be comparatively small in amount arise from cost of the army of occupation and claim of private citizen for loss under award from the|mixed|claims|commission establish under agreement with the|german|government in find a basis for settlement be necessary for the committee of expert to request all the government concern to make some contribution to the adjustment and have feel that should share a proportion of the concession make the state and treasury departments will be in a position shortly to submit for consideration a draft of an agreement to be execute between the|united|state and germany provide for the payment of these revise amount a more extensive statement will be submit at that time the total amount of indebtedness of the various country to the|united|state now fund be this sum be in effect provide by the issue of united|states|government bond to own people the payment of the various government to on account of principal and interest for be estimate at a total of about|$239,000,000 for at about|$236,000,000 for at about|$246,000,000 the measure of american compromise in these settlement may be appreciate from the fact that taxpayer be call upon to find annually in interest and in addition to redeem the principal of sum borrow by the|united|states|government for these purpose alien|enemy property the wise determination that this property seize in war should be return to owner have proceed with considerable rapidity of the original seized cash and property value at a total of about|$625,000,000 all but have be return most of the remainder should be dispose of during the|next|year general economic situation the country have enjoy a large degree of prosperity and sound progress during the|past|year with a steady improvement in method of production and distribution and consequent advancement in standard of living progress have of course be unequal among industry and some such as coal lumber leather and textile still lag behind the long upward trend of fundamental progress however give rise to over optimism as to profit which translate into a wave of uncontrolled speculation in security result in the diversion of capital from business to the stock market and the inevitable crash the natural consequence have be a reduction in the consumption of luxury and semi - necessity by those who have meet with loss and a number of person throw temporarily out of employment price of agricultural product deal in upon the great market have be affect in sympathy with the stock crash fortunately the federal reserve system have take measure to strengthen the position against the|day when speculation would break which together with the strong position of the bank have carry the whole credit system through the crisis without impairment the capital which have be hitherto absorb in stock market loan for speculative purpose be now return to the normal channel of business there have be no inflation in the price of commodity there have be no undue accumulation of good and foreign trade have expand to a magnitude which exert a steadying influence upon activity in industry and employment the sudden threat of unemployment and especially the recollection of the economic consequence of previous crash under a much less secure financial system create unwarranted pessimism and fear be recall that past storm of similar character have result in retrenchment of construction reduction of wage and lay off of worker the natural result be the tendency of business agency throughout the country to pause in plan and proposal for continuation and extension of business and this hesitation unchecke could in intensify into a depression with widespread unemployment and suffering have therefore institute systematic voluntary measure of cooperation with the business institution and with state and municipal authority to make certain that fundamental business of the country shall continue as usual that wage and therefore consume power shall not be reduce and that a special effort shall be make to expand construction work in order to assist in equalize other deficit in employment due to the enlarged sense of cooperation and responsibility which have grow in the business world during the|past|few|year the response have be remarkable and satisfactory have canvass the|federal|government and institute measure of prudent expansion in such work that should be helpful and upon which the different department will make some early recommendation to congress be convince that through these measure have reestablish confidence wage should remain stable a very large degree of industrial unemployment and suffering which would otherwise have occur have be prevent agricultural price have reflect the return confidence the measure take must be vigorously pursue until normal condition be restore agriculture the agricultural situation be improve the gross farm income as estimate by the|department|of|agriculture for the crop season be for be for be and estimate on the basis of price since the last harvest the value of the crop would be over|$12,650,000,000 the slight decline in general commodity price during the|past|few|year naturally assist the farmer ' buying power the number of farmer bankruptcy be very materially decrease below|previous|year the decline in land value now seem to be arrest and rate of movement from the farm to the city have be reduce not all section of agriculture of course have fare equally and some area have suffer from drought responsible farm leader have assure that a large measure of confidence be return to agriculture and that a feeling of optimism pervade that industry the most extensive action for strengthen the agricultural industry ever take by any government be inaugurate through the farm marketing act of june|15|last under provision the|federal|farm|board have be establish comprise of man long and widely experience in agriculture and sponsor by the farm organization of the country during short period of existence the board have take definite step toward a more efficient organization of agriculture toward the elimination of waste in marketing and toward the upbuilding of farmer ' marketing organization on sounder and more efficient line substantial headway have be make in the organization of of the basic commodity grain cotton livestock and wool support by the board to cooperative marketing organization and other board activity undoubtedly have serve to steady the farmer ' market during the recent crisis and have operate also as a great stimulus to the cooperative organization of agriculture the problem of the industry be most complex and the need for sound organization be imperative yet the board be move rapidly along the line lay out for in the act facilitate the creation by farmer of farmer own and farmer control organization and federate into central institution with a view to increase the bargaining power of agriculture prevent and control surplus and mobilize the economic power of agriculture the tariff the special session of congress be call to expedite the fulfillment of party pledge of agricultural relief and the tariff the pledge of farm relief have be carry out at that time state the principle upon which believe action should be take in respect to the tariff an effective tariff upon agricultural product that will compensate the farmer 's high cost and high standard of living have a dual purpose such a tariff not only protect the farmer in domestic market but also stimulate to diversify crop and to grow product that could not otherwise produce and thus lessen dependence upon export to foreign market the great expansion of production abroad under the condition have mention render foreign competition in export market increasingly serious seem but natural therefore that the american farmer have be greatly handicap in foreign market by such competition from the young expand country should ask that foreign access to domestic market should be regulate by take into account the difference in cost of production in consider the tariff for other industry than agriculture find that there have be economic shift necessitate a readjustment of some of the tariff schedule seven|year of experience under the tariff bill enact in have demonstrate the wisdom of congress in the enactment of that measure on the whole have work well in the main wage have be maintain at high level export and import have steadily increase with some exception manufacturing industry have be prosperous nevertheless economic change have take place during that time which have place certain domestic product at a disadvantage and new industry have come into being all of which create the necessity for some limited change in the schedule and in the administrative clause of the law as write in would seem to that the test of necessity for revision be in the main whether there have be a substantial slackening of activity in an industry during the|past|few|year and a consequent decrease of employment due to insurmountable competition in the product of that industry be not as if be set up a new basis of protective duty do that what need to remedy now be whatever substantial loss of employment may have result from shift since that time in determine change in tariff must not fail to take into account the broad interest of the country as a whole and such interest include trade relation with other country no condition have arise in view to change these principle state at the opening of the special session be firmly of the opinion that application to the pende revision will give the country the kind of a tariff law both need and want would be most helpful if action should be take at an early moment more especially at a time when business and agriculture be both cooperate to minimize future uncertainty be just that should know what the rate be to be even a limited revision require the consideration and readjustment of many item the exhaustive inquiry and valuable debate from man representative of all part of the country which be need to determine the detailed rate must necessarily be accomplish in the congress however perfectly this rate structure may be frame at any give time the shifting of economic force which inevitably occur will render change in some item desirable between the necessarily long interval of congressional revision injustice be bind to develop such as be experience by the dairyman the flaxseed producer the glass industry and other under the rate for this reason have be most anxious that the broad principle of the flexible tariff as provide in the exist law should be preserve and delay in action avoid by more expeditious method of determine the cost of production at home and abroad with executive authority to promulgate such change upon recommendation of the|tariff|commission after exhaustive investigation change by the congress in the isolated item such as those to which have refer would have be most unlikely both because of the concentration of opposition in the country who could see no advantage to own industry or state and because of the difficulty of limit consideration by the congress to such isolate case there be no fundamental conflict between the interest of the farmer and the worker lower of the standard of living of either tend to destroy the other the prosperity of rest upon the well being of the other nor be there any real conflict between the east and the west or the north and the south in the|united|state the complete interlocking of economic dependence the common strive for social and spiritual progress common heritage as americans and the infinite web of national sentiment have create a solidarity in a great people unparalleled in all human history these invisible bond should not and can not be shatter by difference of opinion grow out of discussion of a tariff public building under the provision of various act of congress have be authorize for public building and the land upon which to construct be for and for the country at large exclude which be for the acquisition of land in the so call triangle in this city this public building legislation provide for a year program for the|district|of|columbia and between an and nine|year program for the country at large of this sum approximately|$27,400,000 be expend up|to|june|30|last of which have be expend in the district and outside even this generous provision for both and the country be insufficient for most pressing governmental need expensive rent and inadequate facility be extravagance and not economy in the district even after the completion of these project shall have fully clerk house in rented and temporary war building which can last but a little longer therefore recommend that consideration should be give to the extension of authorization both for the country at large and for the|district|of|columbia again distribute over a term of year a survey of the need in both category have be make by the secretary of the treasury and the|postmaster|general would be helpful in the present economic situation if such step be take as would enable early construction work an expedition and enlargement of the program in the district would bring about direct economy in construction by enable the erection of building in regular sequence by maintain a stable labor force in the city contract can be make on more advantageous term the early completion of this program which be an acknowledge need would add dignity to the celebration in of the hundredth anniversary of the birth of president washington in consideration of these project which contribute so much to dignify should like to renew the suggestion that the|fine|arts|commission should be require to pass upon private building which be propose for site face upon public building and park without such control much of the effort of the congress in beautification of the capital will be minimize the waterway and flood control the development of inland waterway have receive new impulse from the completion during this|year of the canalization of the ohio to a uniform depth the development of the other segment of the mississippi system should be expedite and with this in view be recommend an increase in appropriation for river and harbor from per which together with about|$4,000,000 per annum release by completion of the ohio should make available after provide for other river and harbor work a sum of from per annum for the mississippi system and thus bring to early completion conflict of opinion which have arise over the propose floodway from to via have lead to withhold construction upon this portion of the mississippi flood control plan until could be again review by the engineer for any further recommendation to congress the other portion of the project be be vigorously prosecute and have recommend an increase in appropriation for this from of the|present|year to during the|next|fiscal|year expansion of intracoastal waterway to effective barge depth be well warrant be await the action of canada upon the st. lawrence waterway project highway there be over 3,000,000|mile of legally establish highway in the|united|state of which about|10|per|cent be include in the state highway system the remainder be county and other local road about|626,000|mile have be improve with some type of surfacing comprise some|63|per|cent of the state highway system and of the local road of the improve road about|102,000|mile be hard surface comprise about|22|per|cent of the state highway system and about|8|per|cent of the local road while proper planning should materially reduce the list mileage of public road particularly in the agricultural district and turn these road back to useful purpose be evident that road construction must be a long continue program progress in improvement be about|50,000|miles of all type per annum of which some|12,000|miles be of the more durable type the total expenditure of and local government last|year for construction and maintenance assume the huge total of federal aid in the construction of the highway system in conjunction with the states have prove to be beneficial and stimulating must ultimately give consideration to the increase of contribution to these system particularly with a view to stimulate the improvement of farm to market road post|office deficit have now increase to over|$80,000,000 a year of which perhaps be due to loss on ocean mail and air mail contract the department be make an exhaustive study of the source of the deficit with view to later recommendation to congress in respect to the|post|office|quarter be provide in part by the federal construction in part by various form of rent and lease arrangement the practice have grow up in recent|year of contract long term lease under which both rent and amortization principal cost of building be include be advise that fully could be save from many such rent and lease agreement even after allow interest on the capital require at the normal government rate there be also many objectionable feature to some of these practice the provision of adequate|quarter for the|post|office should be put on a sound basis a revision of air mail rate upon a more systematic and permanent footing be necessary the subject be under study and if legislation should prove necessary the subject will be present to the congress in the meantime recommend that the congress should consider the desirability of authorize further expansion of the south|american service commercial aviation during the|past|year progress in civil aeronautic have be remarkable this be to a considerable degree due to the wise assistance of the|federal|government through the establishment and maintenance of airway by the|department|of|commerce and the mail contract from the|post|office|department the government improve airway now exceed 25,000|mile more|than|14,000|mile of which will be light and equip for night fly operation by the close of the|current|year airport construction through all the states be extremely active there be now commercial and municipal airport in operation with an|additional|1,200 propose for early development through this assistance the nation be build a sound aviation system operate by private enterprise over|6,400 plane be in commercial use and pilot be license by the government manufacturing capacity have rise to plane per annum the aviation company have increase regular air transportation until now total per day fourth of which be fly by night mail and express service now connect principal city and extensive service for passenger transportation have be inaugurate and other of importance be imminent american air line now reach into canada and mexico to cuba porto|rico central|america and most of the important country of railway as a whole the railroad never be in such good physical and financial condition and the country have never be so well serve by the great volume of freight traffic ever tender be be carry at a speed never before attain and with satisfaction to the shipper efficiency and new method have result in reduction in the cost of provide freight transportation and freight rate show a continuous descending line from the level enforce by the|world|war have however not yet assure for the future that adequate system of transportation through consolidation which be the objective of the congress in the transportation act the chief purpose of consolidation be to secure well balance system with more uniform and satisfactory rate structure a more stable financial structure more equitable distribution of traffic great efficiency and single line instead of multiple line haul in this way the country will have the assurance of well service and ultimately at low and more even rate than would otherwise be attain legislation to simplify and expedite consolidation method and well to protect public interest should be enact consideration should also be give to relief of the member of the commission from the necessity of detailed attention to comparatively inconsequential matter which under the exist law must receive direct and personal consideration be in the public interest that the member of the commission should not be so press by minor matter that have inadequate time for investigation and consideration of the large question commit to for solution as to many of these minor matter the function of the commission may well be make revisory and the primary responsibility delegate to subordinate official after the practice long in vogue in the executive department merchant marine under the impulse of the merchant marine act of the transfer to private enterprise of the government own steamship line be go forward with increase success the|shipping|board now operate about|18 line which be less|than|half the number originally establish and the estimate of expenditure for be base upon reduction in loss on government line by approximately|one half construction loan have be make to the amount of approximately|$75,000,000 out of the revolving fund authorize by congress and have furnish an additional aid to american shipping and further stimulate the building of vessel in american yard desirous of secure the full value to the nation of the great effort to develop merchant marine by the merchant marine act soon after the inauguration of the present administration appoint an interdepartmental committee consist of the secretary of commerce as chairman the secretary of the navy and the chairman of the|shipping|board to make a survey of the policy be pursue under the act of in respect of mail contract to inquire into working and to advise the|postmaster|general in the administration of the act in particular seem to necessary to determine if the result of the contract already let would assure the purpose express in the act to further develop an american merchant marine to assure permanence in the transportation of the foreign trade of the|united|state and for other purpose and to develop a coordinated policy by which these purpose may be translate into actuality in review of the mail contract already award be find that aggregate separate award impose a governmental obligation of a|little|over|$12,000,000 per annum provision have be impose in of the contract for construction of new vessel with which to replace and expand service these requirement come to a total of vessel in the 10-year period aggregate some other condition in the contract have not work out satisfactorily that study have now be substantially complete and the committee have advise the desirability and the necessity of secure much large undertaking as to service and new construction in future contract the committee at this time be recommend the advertising of additional route make substantial requirement for the construction of new vessel during the life of each contract recommend a total of new vessel will be require under the contract propose of which will be require to be build during the capital cost of this new construction will be approximately|$250,000,000 involve approximately|460,000 gross ton should bidder be find who will make these undertaking will be necessary to recommend to congress an increase in the authorize expenditure by the|post|office of about|$5,500,000 annually will be most advantageous to grant such an authority a conflict as to the administration of the act have arise in the contention of person who have purchase shipping|board vessel that be entitle to mail contract irrespective of whether be the low bidder the|post|office on the other hand be require by law to let contract in that manner be urgent that congress should clarify this situation the banking system be desirable that congress should consider the revision of some portion of the banking law the development of group and chain banking present many new problem the question naturally arise as to whether if allow to expand without restraint these method would dangerously concentrate control of credit and whether would not in any event seriously threaten of the fundamental of the american credit system which be that credit which be base upon banking deposit should be control by person within those area which furnish these deposit and thus be subject to the restraint of local interest and public opinion in those area to some degree however this movement of chain or group banking be a groping for strong support to the bank and a more secure basis for these institution the growth in size and stability of the metropolitan bank be in marked contrast to the trend in the country district with many failure and the loss these failure have impose upon the agricultural community the relinquishment of charter of national bank in great commercial center in favor of state charter indicate that some condition surround the national bank which render unable to compete with state bank and withdrawal result in weaken national banking system have be propose that permission should be grant to national bank to engage in branch banking of a nature that would preserve within limited region the local responsibility and the control of such credit institution all these subject however require careful investigation and may be find advantageous to create a joint commission embrace member of the congress and other appropriate federal official for subsequent report electrical power regulation the|federal|power|commission be now comprise of cabinet officer and the duty involve in the competent conduct of the grow responsibility of this commission far exceed the time and attention which these official can properly afford from other important duty recommend that authority be give for the appointment of full time commissioner to replace be also desirable that the authority of the commission should be extend to certain phase of power regulation the nature of the electric utility industry be such that about|90|per|cent of all power generation and distribution be intrastate in character and most of the states have develop own regulatory system as to certificate of convenience rate and profit of such utility to encroach upon authority and responsibility would be an encroachment upon the right of the|state there be case however of interstate character beyond the jurisdiction of the|state to meet these case would be most desirable if a method could be work out by which initial action may be take between the commission of the states whose joint action should be make effective by the|federal|power|commission with a reserve to act on own motion in case of disagreement or nonaction by the states the radio commission recommend the reorganization of the|radio|commission into a permanent body from present temporary status the requirement of the present law that the commissioner shall be appoint from specified zone should be abolish and a general provision make for equitable selection from different part of the country despite the effort of the commissioner the present method develop a public insistence that the commissioner be specially charge with supervision of radio affair in the zone from which each be appoint as a result there be danger that the system will degenerate from a national system into regional agency with vary practice vary policy competitive tendency and consequent failure to attain utmost capacity for service to the people as a whole muscle shoal be most desirable that this question should be dispose of under present condition the income from these plant be less than could otherwise be secure for use and more especially the public be not secure the full benefit which could be obtain from be belief that such part of these plant as would be useful and the revenue from the remainder should be dedicate for all time to the farmer of the|united|state for investigation and experimentation on a commercial scale in agricultural chemistry by such mean advance discovery of science can be systematically apply to agricultural need and development of the chemical industry of the|tennessee|valley can be assure do not favor the operation by the government of either power or manufacturing business except as an unavoidable by product of some other major public purpose any form of settlement of this question will imply enter upon a contract or contract for the lease of the plant either as a whole or in part and the reservation of facility product or income for agricultural purpose the extremely technical and involved nature of such contract deal with chemical and electrical enterprise add to the unusual difficulty surround these special plant and the rapid commercial change now in progress in power and synthetic nitrogen manufacture lead to suggest that congress create a special commission not to investigate and report as in the past but with authority to negotiate and complete some sort of contract or contract on behalf of the government subject of course to such general requirement as congress may stipulate boulder dam the secretary of the interior be make satisfactory progress in negotiation of the very complex contract require for the sale of the power to be generate at this project these contract must assure the return of all government outlay upon the project recommend that the necessary fund be appropriate for the initiation of this work as soon as the contract be in the hand of congress conservation conservation of national resource be a fix policy of the government important question bear upon conservation of the public land have become urgent conservation of oil and gas resource against future need be a national necessity the working of the oil permit system in development of oil and gas resource on the public domain have be subject to great abuse consider necessary to suspend the issuance of such permit and to direct the review of all outstanding permit as to compliance of the holder with the law the purpose be not only to end such abuse but to place the government in position to review the entire subject be also confront with a major problem in conservation due to the overgrazing on public land the effect of overgrazing which have now become general be not only to destroy the range but by impair the ground coverage seriously to menace the water supply in many part of the west through quick run off spring flood and autumn drought have a third problem of major dimension in the reconsideration of reclamation policy the inclusion of most of the available land of the public domain in exist or plan reclamation project largely complete the original purpose of the|reclamation|service there still remain the necessity for extensive storage of water in the arid states which render desirable that should give a wide vision and purpose to this service to provide for careful consideration of these question and also of well division of responsibility in as between the state and federal|government include the possible transfer to the states for school purpose of the land unreserve for forest park power mineral have appoint a commission|on|conservation|of|the|public|domain with a membership represent the major public land states and at the same time the public at large recommend that congress should authorize a moderate sum to defray expense social|service provide for an extensive and valuable program of constructive social service in education home building protection to woman and child employment public health recreation and many other direction in a broad sense federal activity in these direction have be confine to research and dissemination of information and experience and at most to temporary subsidy to the states in order to secure uniform advancement in practice and method any other attitude by the|federal|government will undermine of the most precious possession of the american people that is local and individual responsibility should adhere to this policy federal official can however make a further and most important contribution by leadership in stimulation of the community and voluntary agency and by extend federal assistance in organization of these force and bring about cooperation among as an instance of this character have recently in cooperation with the|secretaries|of|interior and labor lay the foundation of an exhaustive inquiry into the fact precedent to a nation wide white|house conference on child health and protection this cooperative movement among interested agency will impose no expense upon the government similar nation wide conference will be call in connection with well housing and recreation at a|later|date in view of the considerable difference of opinion as to the policy which should be pursue by the|federal|government with respect to education have appoint a committee representative of the important educational association and other to investigate and present recommendation in cooperation with the secretary of the interior have also appoint a voluntary committee of distinguished membership to assist in a nation wide movement for abolition of illiteracy have recommend additional appropriation for the federal employment service in order that may more fully cover cooperative work with state and local service have also recommend additional appropriation for the|women 's and children's|bureaus for much need research as to fact which feel will prove most helpful public health the advance in scientific discovery as to disease and health impose new consideration upon the nation as a whole be vitally interested in the health of all the people in protection from spread of contagious disease in the relation of physical and mental disability to criminality and in the economic and moral advancement which be fundamentally associate with sound body and mind the organization of preventive measure and health education in personal application be the province of public health service such organization should be as universal as public education support be a proper burden upon the taxpayer can not be organize with success either in sanitary or educational phase except under public authority should be base upon local and state responsibility but consider that the|federal|government have an obligation of contribution to the establishment of such agency in the practical working out of organization exhaustive experiment and trial have demonstrate that the base should be competent organization of the municipality county or other local unit most of municipality and rural county out of now have some such unit organization where highly develop a health unit comprise at least a physician sanitary engineer and community nurse with the addition in some case of another nurse devote to the problem of maternity and child such organization give at once a fundamental control of preventive measure and assist in community instruction the|federal|government through interest in control of contagion act through and the state agency have in the past and should in the future concern with this development particularly in the many rural section which be unfortunately far behind in progress some part of the fund contribute under the sheppard towner|act through the|children's|bureau|of|the|department|of|labor have also find way into these channel recommend to the congress that the purpose of the|sheppard|towner|act should be continue through the|children's|bureau for a|limited|period|of|year and that the congress should consider the desirability of confine the use of federal fund by the states to the building up of such county or other local unit and that such outlay should be positively coordinate with the fund expend through the|united|states|public|health|service direct to other phase of the same county or other local unit organization all fund appropriate should of course be apply through the states so that the public health program of the county or local unit will be efficiently coordinate with that of the whole state federal prison closely relate to crime condition be the administration of the federal prison system federal penal institution be overcrowded and this condition be daily become bad the parole and probation system be inadequate these condition make impossible to perform the work of personal reconstruction of prisoner so as to prepare for return to the duty of citizenship in order to relieve the press evil have direct the temporary transfer of the|army|disciplinary|barracks at leavenworth to the|department|of|justice for use as a federal prison not only be this temporary but be inadequate for present need need some new federal prison and a reorganization of probation and parole system and there should be establish in the|department|of|justice|a|bureau|of|prison with a sufficient force to deal adequately with the grow activity of prison institution authorization for the improvement should be give speedily with initial appropriation to allow the construction of the new institution to be undertake at once immigration restriction of immigration have from every aspect prove a sound national policy press problem be to formulate a method by which the limited number of immigrant whom do welcome shall be adapt to national setting and national need have be oppose to the basis of the quota now in force and have hope that could find some practical method to secure what believe should be real national objective that is fitness of the immigrant as to physique character training and need of service perhaps some system of priority within the quota could produce these result and at the same time enable some hardship in the present system to be clear up recommend that the congress should give the subject further study in which the executive department will gladly cooperate with the hope of discover such method as will more fully secure national necessity veterans have be the policy of government almost from inception to make provision for the man who have be disable in defense of country this policy should be maintain originally take the form of land grant and pension this system continue until entry into the|world|war the congress at that time inaugurate a new plan of compensation rehabilitation hospitalization medical care and treatment and insurance whereby benefit be award to those veteran and immediate dependent whose disability be attributable to war service the basic principle in this legislation be sound in a desire to eliminate all possibility of injustice due to difficulty in establish service connection of disability these principle have be to some degree extend veteran whose disease or injury have become apparent within a brief period after the war be now receive compensation insurance benefit have be liberalize emergency officer be now receive additional benefit the door of the government 's hospital have be open to all veteran even though disease or injury be not the result of war service in addition adjust service certificate have be issue to veteran this in will mean an expenditure of nearly|$3,500,000,000 before in addition to the which be now appropriate annually for veteran ' relief the administration of all law concern the veteran and dependent have be upon the basis of deal generously humanely and justly while some inequality have arise substantial and adequate care have be give and justice administer further improvement in administration may require some amendment from time to time to the law but care should be take to see that such change conform to the basic principle of the legislation be convinced that will gain in efficiency economy and more uniform administration and well definition of national policy if the|national|home|for|volunteer|soldiers and the|veterans'|bureau be bring together under a single agency the total appropriation to these agency now exceed per annum civil service approximately|four fifth of all the employee in the executive civil service now occupy position subject to competitive examination under the civil service law there be however still command opportunity for extend the system these opportunity lie within the province of congress and not the president recommend that a further step be take by authorization that appointment of third class postmaster be make under the civil service law departmental reorganization this subject have be under consideration for over|20|year be promise by both political party in the recent campaign have be repeatedly examine by committee and commission congressional executive and voluntary the conclusion of these investigation have be unanimous that reorganization be a necessity of sound administration of economy of more effective governmental policy and of relief to the citizen from unnecessary harassment in relation with a multitude of scatter governmental agency but the presentation of any specific plan at once enliven opposition from every official whose authority may be curtail or who fear position be imperil by such a result of bureaus and department which wish to maintain authority and activity of citizen and organization who be selfishly interested or who be inspire by fear that favorite bureau may in a new setting be less subject to influence or more subject to some other influence seem to that the essential principle of reorganization be in number first all administrative activity of the same major purpose should be place in group under single head responsibility all executive and administrative function should be separate from board and commission and place under individual responsibility while quasi - legislative and quasi - judicial and broadly advisory function should be remove from individual authority and assign to board and commission indeed these be the fundamental principle upon which government be found and be the principle which have be adhere to in the whole development of business structure and be the distillation of the common sense of generation for instance the conservation of national resource be spread among agency in department suffer from conflict and overlap there be no proper development and adherence to broad national policy and no central point where the searchlight of public opinion may concentrate these function should be group under the direction of some such official as an assistant secretary of conservation the particular department or cabinet officer under which such a group should be place be of secondary importance to the need of concentration the same may be say of educational service of merchant marine aid of public work of public health of veteran ' service and many other the component part of which be widely scatter in the various department and independent agency be desirable that first have experience with these different group in action before create new department these may be necessary later on with this background of all previous experience can see no hope for the development of a sound reorganization of the government unless congress be willing to delegate authority over the problem subject to define principle to the executive who should act upon approval of a joint committee of congress or with the reservation of power of revision by congress within some limited period adequate for consideration prohibition the first duty of the president under oath of office be to secure the enforcement of the law the enforcement of the law enact to give effect to the eighteenth amendment be far from satisfactory and this be in part due to the inadequate organization of the administrative agency of the|federal|government with the hope of expedite such reorganization request on june|6|last that congress should appoint a joint committee to collaborate with executive agency in preparation of legislation would be helpful if could be so appoint the subject have be earnestly consider by the|law|enforcement|commission and the administrative official of the government joint conclusion be that certain step should be take at once first there should be an immediate concentration of responsibility and strengthening of enforcement agency of the|federal|government by transfer to the|department|of|justice of the federal function of detection and to a considerable degree of prosecution which be now lodge in the|prohibition|bureau in the treasury and at the same time the control of the distribution of industrial alcohol and legalized beverage should remain in the treasury second provision should be make for relief of congestion in the federal court by modify and simplify the procedure for deal with the large volume of petty prosecution under various federal act third there should be a codification of the law relate to prohibition to avoid the necessity which now exist of resort to more|than|25 statute enact at various time over technical defect in these statute that have be disclose should be cure would add to these recommendation the desirability of reorganize the various service engage in the prevention of smuggling into border patrol under the|coast|guard further recommendation upon the subject as a whole will be develop after further examination by the|law|enforcement|commission but be not to be expect that any criminal law will ever be fully enforce so long as criminal exist the|district|of|columbia should be the model of city law enforcement in the nation while condition here be much well than in many other city be far from perfect and this be due in part to the congestion of criminal case in the|supreme|court|of|the|district result in long delay furthermore there be need for legislation in the district supplement the national prohibition act more sharply define and enlarge the duty and power of the|district|commissioner and the police of the district and open the way for well cooperation in the enforcement of prohibition between the district official and the prohibition officer of the|federal|government be urgent that these condition be remedie law enforcement and observance no one will look with satisfaction upon the volume of crime of all kind and the growth of organize crime in country have press need so to organize system of administer criminal justice as to establish full vigor and effectiveness need to reestablish faith that the high interest of country be serve by insistence upon the swift and even handed administration of justice to all offender whether be rich or poor that shall effect improvement be vital to the preservation of institution be the most serious issue before people under the authority of congress have appoint a national|commission|on|law|observance|and|enforcement for an exhaustive study of the entire problem of the enforcement of law and the improvement of judicial system include the special problem and abuse grow out of the prohibition law the commission have be invite to make the wide inquiry into the shortcoming of the administration of justice and into the cause and remedy for have organize work under subcommittee deal with the many contributory cause of situation and have enlist the aid of investigator in field require special consideration be confident that as a result of study now be carry forward will make a notable contribution to the solution of press problem pende further legislation the|department|of|justice have be strive to weed out inefficiency wherever exist to stimulate activity on the part of prosecute officer and to use increase care in examine into the qualification of those appoint to serve as prosecutor the department be seek systematically to strengthen the law enforcement agency week by week and month by month not by dramatic display but by steady pressure by removal of negligent official and by encouragement and assistance to the vigilant during the course of these effort have be reveal that in some district cause contribute to the congestion of criminal docket and to delay and inefficiency in prosecution have be lack of sufficient force in the office of united|states attorney clerk of court and marshal these condition tend to clog the machinery of justice the last conference of senior circuit judge have take note of and indorse the department 's proposal for improvement increase in appropriation be necessary and will be ask for in order to reenforce these office the orderly administration of the law involve more than the mere machinery of law enforcement the efficient use of that machinery and a spirit in people in support of law be alike essential have need for improvement in both however much may perfect the mechanism still if the citizen who be dependent upon some law for the protection of all that have and all that hold dear shall insist on select the particular law which will obey undermine own safety and that of country attitude may obscure but can not conceal the ugly truth that the lawbreaker whoever may be be the enemy of society can no longer gloss over the unpleasant reality which should be make vital in the consciousness of every citizen that who condone or traffic with crime who be indifferent to and to the punishment of the criminal or to the lax performance of official duty be the most effective agency for the breakdown of society law can not rise above source in good citizenship in what right minded man most earnestly believe and desire if the law be uphold only by government official then all law be at an end law be make by the people be the right to work for repeal but until repeal be an equal duty to observe and demand enforcement have be gratify at the awakening sense of this responsibility in citizen during the|past|few|month and gratify that many instance have occur which refute the cynicism which have assert that system could not convict those who have defy the law and possess the mean to resist execution these thing reveal a moral awakening both in the people and in official which lie at the very foundation of the rule of law conclusion the test of the rightfulness of decision must be whether have sustain and advance the ideal of the american people self government in foundation of local government justice whether to the individual or to the group order liberty freedom from domination open opportunity and equality of opportunity the initiative and individuality of people prosperity and the lessening of poverty freedom of public opinion education advancement of knowledge the growth of religious spirit the tolerance of all faith the foundation of the home and the advancement of peace transcript the economy and public confidence be deal here with a psychological situation to a very considerable degree be a question of fear have have a collapse in the stock market out of which a good many people have lose money and a lot of people who could not afford to and a lot of unfortunate people have be bring in the effect of which in the american mind create an undue state of alarm because national thinking naturally go back to previous occasion when event of that character have have a very considerable bearing upon the business situation and in final interpretation be employment now a great many people lift standard of living and naturally the effect of such a thing tend to decrease consumption particularly for luxury and semi - luxury and those trade be no doubt still affected but this occasion so far differ from all other in that the credit situation in the country be entirely isolate from due to the|federal|reserve and the bank and there be no credit consideration involve but the natural recovery of increase interest rate by the withdrawal of capital from speculative security take that capital ultimately back into industry and commerce be ordinarily the tendency of industrial leader and everyone else to sit back to see what happen and to be a little more cautious in business than may otherwise have be that have to deal with have also to deal naturally with some unemployment in the semi - necessity trade but the real problem and the interpretation of be of maintenance of employment this be not a question of bolster stock market or stock price or anything of that kind be deal with the vital question of maintain employment in the|united|state and consequently the comfort and standard of living of the people and ability to buy good and proceed in the normal course of life so that the purpose of this movement be to disabuse the public mind of the notion that there have be any serious or vital interruption in economic system and that be go to proceed in the ordinary normal manner and to get that impression over not by preachment and talk but by definite and positive act on the part of industry and business and the government and other as say before do not believe that word ever convince a discouraged person in these situation the thing that bring back be courage and the natural sight of other industry and other man go ahead with program and business so want to get that background upon all because seriously concern the press to give the confidence to the public that the business fabric be now organize take step on own responsibility to carry on that be go to go even farther and stretch to meet any possible condition of employment be the thing that will give courage to the public rather than to say to every|day that should not be alarm so that be try to get this problem across by action in different industry and other group rather than by too much talking and therefore do not want to talk about want the action to speak for these conclusion be not a statement from that be the conclusion of those man who be present transcript condition the president have not anything of any news here to announce think perhaps may like that discuss the business situation with just a little but not from the point of view of publication at all simply for own information see no particular reason for make any public statement about either directly or indirectly the question be somewhat of analysis have have a period of over speculation that have be extremely widespread of those wave of speculation that be more or less uncontrollable as evidence by the effort of the|federal|reserve|board and that ultimately result in a crash due to own weight that crash be perhaps a little expedite by the foreign situation in that result of this whole phenomenon have be the congestion of capital in the loan market in new|york in the driving up of money rate all over the world the foreign central bank have determine that would bring the crisis to an end at least so far as own country be concern advanced money rate very rapidly in practically every european country in order to attract capital that have drift from europe into new|york back into own industry and commerce incidentally the effect of increase discount rate in europe be much great on business structure than be with business structure be not so sensitive to interest rate as be so sharp advancement of discount rate tend to affect this market and probably expedite or even start this movement but once the movement have take place have a number of phenomenon that rapidly develop the first be that the domestic bank in the interior of the|united|state and corporation withdraw money from the call market there have be a very great movement out of new|york into the interior of the|united|state as well as some movement out of new|york into foreign country the incidental result of that be to create a difficult situation in new|york but also to increase the available capital in the interior in the interior there have be in consequence a tendency for interest rate to fall at once because of the unemployed capital bring back into interior point perhaps the situation may be clear on account of parallel with the last very great crisis in that crash the same drain of money immediately take place into the interior in that case there be no|federal|reserve|system there be no way to acquaint of capital movement over the country and the interest rate run up|to|300|percent the result be to bring about a monetary panic in the entire country here with the|federal|reserve|system and the activity of the board and the ability with which the situation have be handle there have be a complete isolation of the stock market phenomenon from the rest of the business phenomenon in the country the board in cooperation with the bank in new|york have make ample capital available for the call market in substitution of the withdrawal this have result in a general fall of interest rate not only in the interior but also in new|york as witness the reduction of the discount rate so that instead of have a panic rise in interest rate with monetary rise follow have exactly the reverse phenomenon have a fall interest p.368 rate that be the normal thing to happen when capital be withdraw from the call market through diminution in value the ultimate result of be a complete isolation of the stock market phenomenon from the general business phenomenon in other word the financial world be function entirely normal and rather more easily today than be because interest rate be less and there be more capital available the effect on production be purely psychological so far there may be say to be from such a shock some tendency on the part of people through alarm to decrease activity but there have be no cancellation of any order whatsoever there have be some lessening of buying in some of the luxury contract but that be not a phenomenon the ultimate result of the normal course of thing would be that with a large release of capital from the speculative market there will be more capital available for the bond and mortgage market that market have be practically starve for the|last|4|or|5|month there have be practically no or very little at least of mortgage or bond money available practically no bond issue of any consequence result have be to create considerable reserve of business a number of state have not be able to place bond for construction a number of municipality with bond issue have be hold up because of the inability to put out at what consider fair rate there be a great number of business concern that would proceed with activity in expansion through mortgage and bond money which have have to delay all of which comprise a very substantial reserve in the country at the present time the normal result will be for the mortgage and bond market to spring up again and those reserve to come in with increase activity the sum of be therefore that have go through a crisis in the stock market but for the first time in history the crisis have be isolate to the stock market have not extend into either the production activity of the country or the financial fabric of the country and for that think may give the major credit to the constitution of the|federal|reserve|system and that be about a summary of the whole situation as stand at this moment transcript in reply to press question as to the business situation the president say the fundamental business of the country that be the production and distribution of commodity be on a sound and prosperous basis the good evidence be that although production and consumption be at high level the average price of commodity as a whole have not increase and there have be no appreciable increase in the stock of manufacture good moreover there have be a tendency of wage to increase the output per worker in many industry again show an increase all of which indicate a healthy condition the construction and building material industry have be to some extent affect by the high interest rate induce by stock speculation and there have be some seasonal decrease in or other industry but these movement be of secondary character when consider in the whole situation a temporary drop in grain price sympathetically with stock exchange price usually happen but as the|department|of|agriculture point out the override fact in grain be that this year 's world wheat harvest be estimate to be less than that of last|year which will result in a very low carryover at the|end|of|the|harvest|year transcript countryman and woman of the radio audience of the untold value

of legislation in reject the report of the senate and house conferee which report be agree to by member of both party the senate have in effect reject a bill which provide for the creation of the most important agency ever set up in the government to assist an industry the propose federal|farm|board endow with extraordinary authority to reorganize the marketing system in the interest of the farmer to stabilize industry and to carry out these arrangement in conjunction with farm cooperative with a capital of as an earnest of the seriousness of the work be a proposal for steady upbuilding of agriculture onto firm foundation of equality with other industry and would remove the agricultural problem from politic and place in the realm of business the conferee bill carry out the plan advance in the campaign in every particular every other plan of agricultural relief be reject in that campaign and this plan be of the most important issue in the principal agricultural states and be give as a mandate by an impressive majority in these states subsidy be condemn in the course of the campaign and the so call debenture plan that be the giving of subsidy on export be not raise by either party nor by proponent no serious attempt have be make to meet the many practical objection and leader in congress have advance against this proposal be not accept by the|house|of|representatives and have be overwhelmingly condemn by the press and be oppose by many lead farm organization for no matter what the theory of the export subsidy may be in the practical world live in will not bring equality but will bring further disparity to agriculture will bring immediate profit to some speculator and disaster to the farmer earnestly hope that the congress will enact the conferee report and allow to enter upon the building of a sound agricultural system rather than to longer deprive the farmer of the relief which sorely need transcript countryman this occasion be not alone the administration of the most sacred oath which can be assume by an american citizen be a dedication and consecration under god to the high office in service of people assume this trust in the humility of knowledge that only through the guidance of almighty providence can hope to discharge ever increase burden be in keep with tradition throughout history that should express simply and directly the opinion which hold concern some of the matter of present importance our progres if survey the situation of nation both at home and abroad find many satisfaction find some cause for concern have emerge from the loss of the|great|war and the reconstruction follow within creased virility and strength from this strength have contribute to the recovery and progress of the world what america have do have give renew hope and courage to all who have faith in government by the people in the large view have reach a high degree of comfort and security than ever exist before in the history of the world through liberation from widespread poverty have reach a high degree of individual freedom than ever before the devotion to and concern for institution be deep and sincere be steadily build a new race a new civilization great in own attainment the influence and high purpose of nation be respect among the people of the world aspire to distinction in the world but to a distinction base upon confidence in sense of justice as well as accomplishment within own border and in own life for wise guidance in this great period of recovery the nation be deeply indebted to but all this majestic advance should not obscure the constant danger from which self government must be safeguard the strong man must at all time be alert to the attack of insidious disease the failure of our system of criminal justice the most malign of all these danger today be disregard and disobedience of law crime be increase confidence in rigid and speedy justice be decrease be not prepared to believe that this indicate any decay in the moral fiber of the american people be not prepared to believe that indicate an impotence of the|federal|government to enforce law be only in part due to the additional burden impose upon judicial system by the eighteenth amendment the problem be much wide than that many influence have increasingly complicate and weaken law enforcement organization long before the adoption of the eighteenth amendment to reestablish the vigor and effectiveness of law enforcement must critically consider the entire federal machinery of justice the redistribution of function the simplification of procedure the provision of additional special tribunal the well selection of jury and the more effective organization of agency of investigation and prosecution that justice may be sure and that may be swift while the authority of the|federal|government extend to but part of vast system of national state and local justice yet the standard which the federal|government establishe have the most profound influence upon the whole structure be fortunate in the ability and integrity of federal judge and attorney but the system which these officer be call upon to administer be in many respect ill adapt to present day condition intricate and involved rule of procedure have become the refuge of both big and little criminal there be a belief abroad that by invoke technicality subterfuge and delay the end of justice may be thwart by those who can pay the cost reform reorganization and strengthening of whole judicial and enforcement system both in civil and criminal side have be advocate for year by statesman judge and bar association first step toward that end should not longer be delay rigid and expeditious justice be the first safeguard of freedom the basis of all order liberty the vital force of progress must not come to be in republic that can be defeat by the indifference of the citizen by exploitation of the delay and entanglement of the law or by combination of criminal justice must not fail because the agency of enforcement be either delinquent or inefficiently organize to consider these evil to find remedy be the most sore necessity of time enforcement of the eighteenth amendment of the undoubted abuse which have grow up under the eighteenth amendment part be due to the cause have just mention but part be due to the failure of some states to accept share of responsibility for concurrent enforcement and to the failure of many state and local official to accept the obligation under oath of office zealously to enforce the law with the failure from these many cause have come a dangerous expansion in the criminal element who have find enlarged opportunity in deal in illegal liquor but a large responsibility rest directly upon citizen there would be little traffic in illegal liquor if only criminal patronize must awake to the fact that this patronage from large number of law abide citizen be supply the reward and stimulate crime have be select by to execute and enforce the law of the country propose to do so to the extent of own ability but the measure of success that the government shall attain will depend upon the moral support which as citizen extend the duty of citizen to support the law of the land be coequal with the duty of government to enforce the law which exist no great national service can be give by man and woman of good will who know be not unmindful of the responsibility of citizenship than that should by example assist in stamp out crime and outlawry by refuse participation in and condemn all transaction with illegal liquor whole system of self government will crumble either if official elect what law will enforce or citizen select what law will support the bad evil of disregard for some law be that destroy respect for all law for citizen to patronize the violation of a particular law on the ground that be oppose to be destructive of the very basis of all that protection of life of home and property which rightly claim under other law if citizen do not like a law duty as honest man and woman be to discourage violation right be openly to work for repeal to those of criminal mind there can be no appeal but vigorous enforcement of the law fortunately be but a small percentage of people activity must be stop a national|investigation propose to appoint a national commission for a search investigation of the whole structure of federal system of jurisprudence to include the method of enforcement of the eighteenth amendment and the cause of abuse under purpose will be to make such recommendation for reorganization of the administration of federal law and court procedure as may be find desirable in the meantime be essential that a large part of the enforcement activity be transfer from the|treasury|department to the|department|of|justice as a beginning of more effective organization the relation of government to business the election have again confirm the determination of the american people that regulation of private enterprise and not government ownership or operation be the course rightly to be pursue in relation to business in recent|year have establish a differentiation in the whole method of business regulation between the industry which produce and distribute commodity on the hand and public utility on the other in the former law insist upon effective competition in the latter because substantially confer a monopoly by limit competition must regulate service and rate the rigid enforcement of the law applicable to both group be the very base of equal opportunity and freedom from domination for all people and be just as essential for the stability and prosperity of business as for the protection of the public at large such regulation should be extend by the|federal|government within the limitation of the constitution and only when the individual states be without power to protect citizen through own authority on the other hand should be fearless when the authority rest only in cooperation by the government the large purpose of economic thought should be to establish more firmly stability and security of business and employment and thereby remove poverty still further from border people have in recent|year develop a new find capacity for cooperation among to effect high purpose in public welfare be an advance toward the high conception of self- government self government do not and should not imply the use of political agency alone progress be bear of cooperation in the community not from governmental restraint the government should assist and encourage these movement of collective self- help by cooperate with business have by cooperation make great progress in the advancement of service in stability in regularity of employment and in the correction of own abuse such progress however can continue only so long as business manifest respect for law there be an equally important field of cooperation by the|federal|government with the multitude of agency state municipal and private in the systematic development of those process which directly affect public health recreation education and the home have need further to perfect the mean by which government can be adapt to human service education although education be primarily a responsibility of the states and local community and rightly so yet the nation as a whole be vitally concerned in development everywhere to the high standard and to complete universality self government can succeed only through an instruct electorate objective be not simply to overcome illiteracy the nation have march far beyond that the more complex the problem of the nation become the great be the need for more and more advanced instruction moreover as number increase and as life expand with science and invention must discover more and more leader for every walk of life can not hope to succeed in direct this increasingly complex civilization unless can draw all the talent of leadership from the whole people civilization after another have be wreck upon the attempt to secure sufficient leadership from a single group or class if would prevent the growth of class distinction and would constantly refresh leadership with the ideal of people must draw constantly from the general mass the full opportunity for every boy and girl to rise through the selective process of education can alone secure to this leadership public health in public health the discovery of science have open a new era many section of country and many group of citizen suffer from disease the eradication of which be mere matter of administration and moderate expenditure public health service should be as fully organize and as universally incorporate into governmental system as be public education the return be a|thousand fold in economic benefit and infinitely more in reduction of suffering and promotion of human happiness world peace the|united|state fully accept the profound truth that own progress prosperity and peace be interlock with the progress prosperity and peace of all humanity the whole world be at peace the danger to a continuation of this peace today be largely the fear and suspicion which still haunt the world no suspicion or fear can be rightly direct toward country those who have a true understanding of america know that have no desire for territorial expansion for economic or other domination of other people such purpose be repugnant to ideal of human freedom form of government be ill adapt to the responsibility which inevitably follow permanent limitation of the independence of other people superficial observer seem to find no destiny for abound increase in population in wealth and power except that of imperialism fail to see that people be engross in the building for of a new economic system a new social system a new political system all of which be characterize by aspiration of freedom of opportunity and thereby be the negation of imperialism fail to realize that because of abound prosperity youth be press more and more into institution of learning;that people be seek a large vision through art literature science and travel that be move toward strong moral and spiritual life that from these thing sympathy be broaden beyond the bound of nation and race toward true expression in a real brotherhood of man fail to see that the idealism of america will lead to no narrow or selfish channel but inspire to do full share as a nation toward the advancement of civilization will do that not by mere declaration but by take a practical part in support all useful international undertaking not only desire peace with the world but to see peace maintain throughout the world wish to advance the reign of justice and reason toward the extinction of force the recent treaty for the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy set an advanced standard in conception of the relation of nation acceptance should pave the way to great limitation of armament the offer of which sincerely extend to the world but full realization also imply a great and great perfection in the instrumentality for pacific settlement of controversy between nation in the creation and use of these instrumentality should support every sound method of conciliation arbitration and judicial settlement american statesman be among the first to propose and have constantly urge upon the world the establishment of a tribunal for the settlement of controversy of a justiciable character the|permanent|court|of|international|justice in major purpose be thus peculiarly identify with american ideal and with american statesmanship no more potent instrumentality for this purpose have ever be conceive and no other be practicable of establishment the reservation place upon adherence should not be misinterpret the|united|state seek by these reservation no special privilege or advantage but only to clarify relation to advisory opinion and other matter which be subsidiary to the major purpose of the court the way should and believe will be find by which may take proper place in a movement so fundamental to the progress of peace people have determine that should make no political engagement such as membership in the|league|of|nations which may commit in advance as a nation to become involved in the settlement of controversy between other country adhere to the belief that the independence of america from such obligation increase ability and availability for service in all field of human progress have lately return from a journey among sister republics of the|western|hemisphere have receive unbounded hospitality and courtesy as expression of friendliness to country be hold by particular bond of sympathy and common interest with be each of build a racial character and a culture which be an impressive contribution to human progress wish only for the maintenance of independence the growth of stability and prosperity while have have war in the|western|hemisphere yet on the whole the record be in encourage contrast with that of other part of the world fortunately the new world be largely free from the inheritance of fear and distrust which have so trouble the old world should keep so be impossible countryman to speak of peace without profound emotion in thousand of home in america in million of home around the world there be vacant chair would be a shameful confession of unworthiness if should develop that have abandon the hope for which all these man die surely civilization be old enough surely mankind be mature enough so that ought in own lifetime to find a way to permanent peace abroad to west and east be nation whose son mingle blood with the blood of son on the battlefield most of these nation have contribute to race to culture knowledge and progress from of derive very language and from many of much of the genius of institution desire for peace be as deep and sincere as own peace can be contribute to by respect for ability in defense peace can be promote by the limitation of arm and by the creation of the instrumentality for peaceful settlement of controversy but will become a reality only through self- restraint and active effort in friendliness and helpfulness covet for this administration a record of have further contribute to advance the cause of peace party responsibility in form of democracy the expression of the popular will can be effect only through the instrumentality of political party maintain party government not to promote intolerant partisanship but because opportunity must be give for expression of the popular will and organization provide for the execution of mandate and for accountability of government to the people follow that the government both in the executive and the legislative branch must carry out in good faith the platform upon which the party be entrust with power but the government be that of the whole people the party be the instrument through which policy be determined and man choose to bring into being the animosity of election should have no place in government for government must concern alone with the common weal special session of the congres action upon some of the proposal upon which the|republican|party be return to power particularly further agricultural relief and limited change in the tariff can not in justice to farmer labor and manufacturer be postpone shall therefore request a special session of congress for the consideration of these question shall deal with each of upon the assembly of the congress other mandate from the election appear to that the more important further mandate from the recent election be the maintenance of the integrity of the constitution the vigorous enforcement of the law the continuance of economy in public expenditure the continue regulation of business to prevent domination in the community the denial of ownership or operation of business by thegovernment in competition with citizen the avoidance of policy which would involve in the controversy of foreign nation the more effective reorganization of the department of the|federal|government the expansion of public work and the promotion of welfare activity affect education and the home these be the more tangible determination of the election but beyond be the confidence and belief of the people that would not neglect the support of the embed ideal and aspiration of america these ideal and aspiration be the touchstone upon which the day to day administration and legislative act of government must be test more than this the government must so far as lie within proper power give leadership to the realization of these ideal and to the fruition of these aspiration no one can adequately reduce these thing of the spirit to phrase or to a catalogue of definition do know what the attainment of these ideal should be the

for by new revenue otherwise shall reach the|end|of|the|year with the unthinkable result of an unbalanced budget for the first time during term of office face that contingency be certain that the

of the greek debt and the austrian debt both of these be comparatively small and country can afford to be generous the rehabilitation of these country await & settlement there would also be advantage to trade could scarcely afford to be the only nation that refuse the relief which austria seek the congress have already grant austria a long time moratorium which be understand will be waive and immediate payment begin on debt on the same basis which have extend to other country peace treaty of the most important treaty ever lay before the senate of the|united|state will be that which the nation recently sign at paris and to which other nation have declare intention to adhere renounce war as a national policy and agree to resort only to peaceful mean for the adjustment of international difference be the most solemn declaration against war the most positive adherence to peace that be possible for sovereign nation to make do not supersede inalienable sovereign right and duty of national defense or undertake to commit before the event to any mode of action which the congress may decide to be wise ever the treaty should be break but be a new standard in the world around which can rally the informed and enlighten opinion of nation to prevent government from beii4'forc into hostile action by the temporary outbreak of international animosity the observance of this covenant so simple and so straightforward promise more for the peace of the world than any other agreement ever negotiate among the nation national|defense the first duty of government to own citizen and foreigner within border be the preservation of order unless and until that duty be meet a government be not even eligible for recognition among the family of nation the advancement of world civilization likewise be dependent upon that order among the people of different country which term peace to insure citizen against the infringement of legal right at home and abroad to preserve order liberty and peace by make the law supreme have an army and a navy both of these be organize for defensive purpose army could not be much reduce but do not need to be increase such new housing and repair as be necessary be tinder way and the program in aviation be be put into effect in both branch of service navy accord to generally accept standard be deficient in cruiser have comparatively new vessel that be old and to be build be evident that renewal and replacement must be provide this matter be thoroughly canvass at the last session of the congress and do not need restatement the bill before the senate with the elimination of the time clause should be pass have no intention of compete with any other country this building program be for necessary replacement and to meet need for defense the cost of national defense be stupendous have increase in the estimate expenditure for be while this be make up of many item be after all mostly dependent upon number defensive need do not can for any increase in the number of man in the army or the navy have reach the limit of what ought to expend for that purpose wish to repeat again for the benefit of the timid and the suspicious that this country be neither militaristic nor imperialistic many people at home and abroad who constantly make this charge be the same one who be even more solicitous to have extend assistance to foreign country when such assistance be grant the inevitable result be that have foreign interest for to refuse the customary support and protection of such interest would be in derogation of the sovereignty of this nation large foreign interest be in the|british|empire france and italy because be constantly solicitous for those interest doubt if anyone would suppose that those country feel harbor toward any militaristic or imperialistic design as for small country cer tainly do not want any of be more anxious than be to have sovereignty respect entire influence be in behalf of independence cuba stand as a witness to adherence to this principle the position of this government relative to the limitation of armament the result already secure and the development up to the present time be so well known to the congress that do not require any restatement veterans the magnitude of present system of veteran ' relief be without precedent and the result have be far reach for year a service pension have be grant to the|grand|army and lately to the survivor of the|spanish american|war at the time enter the|world|war however congress depart from the usual pension system follow by gove2rnment eleven|year have elapse since law be first enact initiate a system of compensation rehabilitation hospitalization and insurance for the disabled of the|world|war and dependent the administration of all the law concern relief have be a difficult task but can safely be state that these measure have omit nothing in desire to deal generously and humanely should continue to foster this system and provide all the facility necessary for adequate care be the conception of government that the pension roll be an honor roll should include all those who be justly entitle to benefit but exclude all other annual expenditure for all form of veteran ' relief now approximate and be increase from be doubtful if the peak of expenditure will be reach even under present legislation for sonic time yet to come further amendment to the exist law will be suggest by the|american|legion the veterans of foreign wars of the|united|state the disabled american veterans of the|world|war and other like organization and may be necessary for administrative purpose or in order to remove some exist inequality in the present law to make further change be sure that such recommendation may be submit to the congress will receive careful consideration but because of the vast expenditure now be make each|year with every assurance that will increase and because of the great liberality of the exist law the proposal of any additional legislation deal with this subject should receive most search scrutiny from the congress be familiar with the suggestion that the various public agency now deal with matter of veteran ' relief be consolidate in government department some advantage to this plan seem apparent especially in the simplification of administration find in the opportunity of bring about a great uniformity in the application of veteran ' relief recommend that a survey be make by the proper committee of congress deal with this subject in order to determine whether legislation to secure this consolidation be desirable agriculture the|past|year have be mark by notable though not uniform improvement in agriculture the general purchasing power of farm product and the volume of production have advance this mean not only further progress in overcome the price disparity into which agriculture be plunge in but also increase efficiency on the part of farmer and a well ground confidence in the future of agriculture the livestock industry have attain the good balance for many|year and be prosper conspicuously dairyman beef producer an poultryman be receive substantially large return than last|year cotton although low in price than at this time last|year be produce in great volume and the prospect for cotton income be favorable but progress be never uniform in a vast and highly diversified agriculture or industry cash grain hay tobacco and potato will bring somewhat small return this|year than last present indication be however that the gross farm income will be somewhat large than in when the total be the corresponding figure for be and in still well result would have be secure this|year have there not be an undue increase in the production of certain crop this be particularly true of potato which have sell at an unremunerative price or at a loss as a direct result of overexpansion of acreage the present status of agriculture although greatly improve over that of a|few|years|ago bespeak the need of further improvemen4 which call for determined effort of farmer encourage and assist by wise public policy the government have be and must continue to be alive to the need of agriculture in more constructive legislation of direct benefit to agriculture have be adopt than during any other period the|department|of|agriculture have be broaden and reorganize to insure great efficiency the department be lay great stress on the economic and business phase of agriculture be lend every possible assistance to cooperative marketing association regulatory and research work have be segregate in order that each field may be serve more effectively can not too strongly commend in the field of fact finding the research work of the|department|of|agriculture and the state experiment station the department now receive annually more for research than in in addition the fund pay to the states for experimentation purpose under the|purnell|act constitute an annual increase in federal payment to state agricultural experiment station of over the amount appropriate in the program of support for research may wisely be continue and expand since have appropriate for extension work and this sum be to be increase next|year under authorization by the|capper ketcham|act the surplus problem while these development in fundamental research regulation and dissemination of agricultural information be of distinct hell to agriculture additional effort be need the surplus problem demand attention as emphasize in last message the government should assume no responsibility in normal time for crop surplus clearly due to overextended acreage the government should however provide reliable information as a guide to private effort and in this connection fundamental research on prospective supply and demand as a guide to production and marketing should be encourage expenditure of public fund to bring in more new land should have most search scrutiny so long as farmer face unsatisfactory price for crop and livestock produce on land already under cultivation every proper effort should be make to put land to us for which be adapt the reforestation of land best suit for timber production be progress and should be encourage and to this end the forest taxation inquiry be institute to afford a practical guide for public policy improvement bas be make in graze regulation in the forest reserve not only to protect the range but to preserve the soil from erosion similar action be urgently need to protect other public land which be now overgrazed and rapidly erode temporary expedient though sometimes capable of appease the demand of the moment can not permanently solve the surplus problem and may seriously aggravate hence put the government directly into business subsidy and price fixing and the allure promise of political action as a substitute for private initiative should be avoid the government should aid in promote orderly marketing and in handle surplus clearly due to weather and seasonal condition as a beginning there should be create a federal farm board consist of able and experienced man empower to advise producer ' association in establish central agency or stabilization corporation to handle surplus to seek wear economical mean of merchandising and to aid the producer in secure return accord to the a14 of product a revolving loan fund should be provide for the necessary financing until these agency shall have develop mean of finance operation through regularly constitute credit institution such a bill should carry authority for raise the money by loan or otherwise necessary to meet the expense as the treasury have no surplus agriculture have lag behind industry in achieve that unity of effort which modern economic life demand the cooperative movement which be gradually build the need organization be in harmony with public interest and therefore merit public encouragement the responsibility of the state important phase of public policy relate to agriculture lie within the sphere of the states while successive reduction in federal taxis have relieve most farmer of direct taxis to state and local levy have become a serious burden this problem need immediate and thorough study with a view to correction at the early possible moment will have to be make largely by the states commerce be desirable that the government continue helpful attitude toward american business the activity of the|department|of|commerce have contribute largely to the present satisfactory posi tion in international trade which have reach about|$9,000,000,000 annually there should be no slackening of effort in that direction be also important that the department 's assistance to domestic commerce be continue there be probably no way in which the government can aid sound economic progress more effectively than by cooperation with business man to reduce waste in distribution commercial aeronautics continued progress in civil aviation be most gratifying demand for airplane and motor have tax both the industry and the licensing and inspection service of the|department|of|commerce to capacity while the compulsory licensing provision of the air commerce act apply only to equipment and personnel engage in interstate and foreign commerce a federal license may be procure by anyone possess the necessary qualification state legislation local airport regulation and insurance requirement make such a license practically indispensable this result in uniformity of regulation and increase safety in operation which be essential to aeronautical development over|17,000 young man and woman have now apply for federal air pilot 's license or permit more|than per cent of apply during the|past|year national airway system exceed in length and have light for night operation provision have be make for light more during the|current|fiscal|year and equip an equal mileage with radio facility quarter of people be now serve by these route with the rapid growth of air mail express and passenger service this new transportation medium be daily become a more important factor in commerce be noteworthy that this development have take place without governmental subsidy commercial passenger flight operate on schedule have reach 13,000|mile per day during the next fortnight this nation will entertain the nation of the world in a celebration of the fifth anniversary of the first successful airplane flight the credit for this epoch make achievement belong to a citizen of own country orville|wright cuban parcel post desire to repeat recommendation of an early message that congress enact the legislation necessary to make permanent the|parcel|post|convention with cuba both as a facility to american commerce and as a measure of equity to cuba in the class of good which that country can send here by parcel post without detriment to own trade maine battleship|memorial when attend the pan american conference at habana the president of cuba show a marble statue make from the original memorial that be overturn by a storm after be erect on the cuban shore to the memory of the man who perish in the destruction of the battleship maine as a testimony of friendship and appreciation of and people lie most gen erously offer to present this to the united|stat and assure of pleasure in accept there be no location in the|white|house for place so large and heavy a structure and therefore urge the congress to provide by law for some locality where can be set up railroads in previous annual message have suggest the enactment of law to promote railroad consolidation with the view of increase the efficiency of transportation and lessen cost to the public while consolidation can and should be make under the present law until be change vet the provision of the act of have not be find fully adequate to meet the need of other method of consolidation amendment design to remedy these defect have be consider at length by the respective committee of congress and a bill be report out late in the last session which understand have the approval in principle of the|interstate|commerce|commission be to be hope that this legislation may be enact at an|early|date experience have show that the interstate commerce law require definition and clarification in several other respect some of which have be point out by the|interstate|commerce|commission in annual report to the congress will promote the public interest to have the congress give early consideration to the recommendation there make merchant marine the cost of maintain the|united|states|government merchant fleet have be steadily reduce have establish american flag line in foreign trade where have never before exist as a means of promote commerce and as a naval auxiliary there have be sell to private american capital for operation within of these line which under the encouragement of the recent legislation pass by the congress give promise of continue successful operation additional legislation from time to time may be necessary to promote future advancement under private control through the cooperation of the|post|office|department and the|shipping|board long term contract be be make with american steamship line for carry mail which already promise the construction of new vessel and the gradual reestablishment of the american merchant marine as a private enterprise no action of the|national|government have be so beneficial to shipping the cost be be absorb to a considerable extent by the disposal of unprofitable line operate by the|shipping|board for which the new law have make a market meanwhile should be policy to maintain necessary strategic line under the government operation until can be transfer to private capital inter american highway in message last|year express the view that should lend encouragement for more good road to all the principal point on this hemisphere south of the|rio|grande view have not change the|pan|american|union have recently indorse in some of the country to the south a great deal of progress be be make in road building in other engineering feature be often exact and finance difficult as those country enter upon program for road building should be ready to contribute from abundant experience to make task easy of accomplishment prefer not to go into civil life to accomplish this end already furnish military and naval advisor and follow this precedent could draw competent man from these same source and from the|department|of|agriculture should provide southern neighbor if request with such engineer advisor for the construction of road and bridge private t1literest should look with favor upon all reasonable loan seek by these country to open main line of travel such assistance should be give especially to any project for a highway design to connect all the country on this hemisphere and thus facilitate intercourse and close relation among air|mail|service the friendly relation and the extensive commercial intercourse with the|western|hemisphere to the south of be be further cement by the establishment and extension of air mail route shall soon have from key|west florida over cuba haiti and santo|domingo to san|juan p.|r. where will connect with another route to trinidad there will be another route from to the|canal|zone where connection will be make with a route across the northern coast of to paramaribo this will give a circle around the caribbean under own control additional connection will be make at colon with a route run down the west coast of as far as conception chile and with the french air mail at paramaribo run down the eastern coast of the air service already span continent with lateral run to mexico and canada and cover a daily flight of over|28,000|mile with an average cargo of waterway river and harbor improvement be proceed with vigor in the|past|few|year ave have increase the appropriation for this regular work besides what be to be expend on flood control the total appropriation for this|year be be almost ready for opening work on the missouri and other river be under way in accordance with the mississippi flood law army engineer be make investigation and survey on other stream throughout the country with a view to flood control navigation waterpower and irrigation bar(re line be be operate under generous appropriation and negotiation be develop relative to the st. lawrence waterway to secure the large benefit from all these waterway joint rate must be establish with the railroad preferably by agreement but otherwise as a result of congressional action have recently pass several river and harbor bill the work order by the congress not yet complete will cost about|$243 besides the|hundreds|of|million to be spend on the mississippi flood way until can see way out of this expense no further river and harbor legislation should be pass as expenditure to put into effect would be four|or|five|year away irrigation of arid lands for many|years the|federal|government have be commit to the wise policy of reclamation and irrigation while have meet with some failure due to unwise selection of project and lack of thorough soil survey so that could not be place on a sound business basis on the whole the service have be of such incalculable benefit in so many state that no one would advocate abandonment the program to which be already commit provide for the construction of new project authorize by congress and the completion of old project will tax the resource of the reclamation fund over a|period|of|years the high cost of improve and equip farm add to the difficulty of secure settler for vacant farm on federal project readjustment authorize by the reclamation relief act of may|25,|1926 have give more favorable term of repayment to settler these new financial arrangement and the general prosperity on irrigation project have result in increase collection by the|department|of|the|interior of charge due the reclamation fund nevertheless the demand for still small yearly payment on some project continue these condition should have consideration in connection with any propose new project colorado river for several|year the congress have consider the erection of a dam on the|colorado|river for flood control irrigation and domestic water purpose all of which ma properly be consider as government function there would be an incidental creation of water power which could be use for generate electricity as private enterprise can very well fill this field there be no need for the government to go into be unfortunate that the states interested in this water have be unable to agree among nevertheless any legislation should give every possible safeguard to the present and prospective right of each of the congress will have before the detailed report of a special board appoint to consider the engineering and economic feasibility of this project from the short summary which have see of judge consider the engineering problem can be meet at somewhat increase cost over previous estimate prefer the black|canyon site on the economic feature be not so clear and appear to base conclusion on many condition which can not be establish with certainty so far as can judge however from the summary conclusion appear sufficiently favorable so that feel warranted in recommend a measure which will protect the right of the states discharge the necessary government function and leave the electrical field to private enterprise muscle shoal the development of other method of produce nitrate will probably render this plant less important for that purpose than formerly but have and be tell still provide a practical method of make nitrate for national defense and farm fertilizer by divide the property into component part of power and nitrate plant would be possible to dispose of the power reserve the right to any concern that wish to make nitrate to use any power that may be need for that purpose such a disposition of the power plant can be make that will return in rental about|$2,000,000 per year if the congress would giant the secretary of war authority to lease the nitrate plant on such term as would insure the large production of nitrate the entire property could begin to function such a division be aware have never seem to appeal to the congress should also gladly approve a bill grant authority to lease the entire property for the production of nitrate wish to avoid build another lam at public expense future operator should provide for that but if be to be require to repay the cost of such dam with tile prevail commercial rate for interest this difficulty will be considerably lessen nor do think this property should be make a vehicle for put the|united|states|government indiscriminately into the private and retail field of power distribution and nitrate sale conservation the practical application of economy to the resource of the country call for conservation this do not mean that every resource should not be develop to full degree but mean that none of should be waste have a conservation board work on oil problem this be of the utmost importance to the future well being of people in this age of oil burn engine and tile general application of gasoline to transportation the secretary of the interior should not be compel to lease oil land of the|osage|indian when the market be depressed and the future supply be in jeopardy while the area of land remain in public ownership be small compare with the vast area in private ownership the natural resource of those in public ownership be of immense present and future value this be particularly trite as to mineral and water power the proper bureaus have be classify these resource to the end that may be conserve appropriate estimate be be submit in the budget for the further prosecution of this important work immigration the policy of restrictive immigration should be maintain authority should be grant the secretary of labor to give immediate preference to learn profession and expert essential to new industry the reuniting of family should be expedite immigration and naturalization law may well be codify wage earner in economic life country have reject the long accepted law of a limitation of the wage fund which lead to pessimism and despair because be the doctrine of perpetual poverty and have substitute for the american conception that the only limit to profit and wage be production which be the doctrine of optimism and hope because lead to prosperity here and there the council of labor be still darken by the theory that only by limit individual production can there be any assurance of permanent employment for increase number but in general management and wage earner alike have become emancipate from this doom and have enter a new era in industrial thought which have unleash the productive capacity of the individual worker with an increase scale of wage and profit the end of which be not yet the application of this theory account for widen distribution of wealth no discovery ever do more to increase the happiness and prosperity of the people since increase production have increase wage in general while in certain select trade have run as high as per cent and even in the boot and shoe shop the increase be over per cent and in woolen mill although these industry have not prosper like other as the rise in live cost in this period be negligible these figure represent real wage increase the cause of constructive economy require that the government should cooperate with private interest to eliminate the waste arise from industrial accident this item with all that have be do to reduce still reach enormous proportion with great suffering to the workman and great loss to the country woman and child the|federal|government should continue solicitous care for the woman wage earner and effort in behalf of public health which be reduce infant mortality and improve the and mental condition of citizen

of this be the generous increase make at the last session of the congress generally applicable to federal employee and another bill increase the pay in certain branch of the|postal|service beyond the large increase which be make this raise the average level from to make an increase in seven|year of over per cent while be well know that in the upper bracket the pay in the federal service be much small than in private employment in the low bracket range well up be much high be high not only in actual money pay but in privilege grant a vacation of actual work day or with additional time run in some department as|high|as|30|day for sick leave and the generous provision of the retirement act no other body of public servant ever occupy such a fortunate position education through

experience but have reach this position should not fail to comprehend that can easily be lose need more effort for support than the less exalted place of the world shall not be permit to take case but shall continue to be require to spend our|day in unremitting toil the action of the government must command the confidence of the country without this prosperity would be lose must extend to other country the large measure of generosity moderation and patience in addition to deal justly can well afford to walk humbly the end of government be to keep open the opportunity for a more abundant life

this campaign now draw near a close the platform of the party define principle and offering solution of various national problem have be present and be be earnestly consider by people after four|month ' debate be not which find reason for abandonment of any of the principle have lay down or of the view have express for solution of the problem before the country the principle to which adhere be root deeply in the foundation of national life the solution which propose be base on experience with government and on a consciousness that may have the responsibility for place those solution in action in acceptance speech endeavor to outline the spirit and ideal by which would be guide in carry that platform into administration tonight will not deal with the multitude of issue which have be already well canvass intend rather to discuss some of those more fundamental principle and ideal upon which believe the|government|of|the|united|state should be conduct the|republican|party have ever be a party of progress do not need to review seventy|year of constructive history have always reflect the spirit of the american people never have do more for the advancement of fundamental progress than during the|past|seven|and|a|half|year since take over the government amidst the ruin leave by war detract nothing from the character and energy of the american people minimize in no degree the quality of accomplishment to say that the policy of have play a large part in recuperation from the war and the building of the magnificent progress which show upon every hand today say with emphasis that without the wise policy which the|republican|party have bring into action during this period no such progress would have be possible the first responsibility of the|republican|administration be to renew the march of progress from collapse by the war that task involve the restoration of confidence in the future and the liberation and stimulation of the constructive energy of people discharge that task there be not a person within the sound of voice that do not know the profound progress which country have make in this period every man and woman know that american comfort hope and confidence for the future be immeasurably high this|day than be and half|years|ago be not purpose to enter upon a detailed recital of the great constructive measure of the|past|seven|and|a|half|year by which this have be bring about be sufficient to remind of the restoration of employment to the million who walk street in idleness to remind of the creation of the budget system the reduction of six|billion of national debt which give the powerful impulse of that vast sum return to industry and commerce the sequent reduction of taxis and thereby the lift to the living of every family the enactment of adequate protective tariff and immigration law which have safeguard worker and farmer from flood of good and labor from foreign country the creation of credit facility and many other aid to agriculture the building up of foreign trade the care of veteran the development of aviation of radio of inland waterway of highway the expansion of scientific research of welfare activity the making of safe highway safe mine well home the spread of outdoor recreation the improvement in public health and the care of child and a score of other progressive action nor do need to remind that government today deal with an economic and social system vastly more intricate and delicately adjust than ever before that system now must be keep in perfect tune if would maintain uninterrupted employment and the high standard of living of people the government have come to touch this delicate web at a point yearly the relation of government to national prosperity become more and more intimate only through keen vision and helpful cooperation by the government have stability in business and stability in employment be maintain during this|past|seven|and|a|half|year there always be some locality some industry and some individual who do not share the prevail prosperity the task of government be to lessen these inequality never have there be a period when the|federal|government have give such aid and impulse to the progress of people not alone to economic progress but to the development of those agency which make for moral and spiritual progress but in addition to this great record of contribution of to progress there have be a further fundamental contribution a contribution underlie and sustain all the other and that be the resistance of to every attempt to inject the government into business in competition with citizen after the war when assume administration of the country be face with the problem of determination of the very nature of national life during have build up a form of self government and a social system which be peculiarly own differ essentially from all other in the world be the american system be just as definite and positive a political and social system as have ever be develop on earth be found upon a particular conception of self government in which decentralize local responsibility be the very base further than this be found upon the conception that only through order liberty freedom and equal opportunity to the individual will initiative and enterprise spur on the march of progress and in insistence upon equality of opportunity have system advanced beyond all the world during the war necessarily turn to the government to solve every difficult economic problem the government have absorb every energy of people for war there be no other solution for the preservation of the state the|federal|government become a centralized despotism which undertake unprecedented responsibility assume autocratic power and take over the business of citizen to a large degree regiment whole people temporarily into a socialistic state however justify in time of war if continue in peace time would destroy not only american system but with progress and freedom as well when the war close the most vital of all issue both in own country and throughout the world be whether government should continue wartime ownership and operation of many instrumentality of production and distribution be challenge with a peace time choice between the american system of rugged individualism and a european philosophy of diametrically oppose doctrine — doctrine of paternalism and state socialism the acceptance of these idea would have mean the destruction of self government through centralization of government would have mean the undermining of the individual initiative and enterprise through which people have grow to unparalleled greatness from the beginning resolutely turn face away from these idea and these war practice a republican congress cooperate with the democratic administration to demobilize many of war activity at that time the party be accord upon that point when the|republican|party come into full power go at once resolutely back to fundamental conception of the state and the right and responsibility of the individual thereby restore confidence and hope in the american people free and stimulate enterprise restore the government to position as an umpire instead of a player in the economic game for these reason the american people have go forward in progress while the rest of the world have halt and some country have even go backwards if anyone will study the cause of retarded recuperation in europe will find much of due to the stifling of private initiative on hand and overloading of the government with business on the other there have be revive in this campaign however a series of proposal which if adopt would be a long step toward the abandonment of american system and a surrender to the destructive operation of governmental conduct of commercial business because the country be face with difficulty and doubt over certain national problem that is prohibition farm relief and electrical power opponent propose that must thrust government a long way into the business which give rise to these problem in effect abandon the tenet of own party and turn to state socialism as a solution for the difficulty present by all be propose that shall change from prohibition to the state purchase and sale of liquor if agricultural relief program mean anything mean that the government shall directly or indirectly buy and sell and fix price of agricultural product and be to go into the hydroelectric power business in other word be confront with a huge program of government in business there be therefore submit to the american people a question of fundamental principle that be shall depart from the principle of american political and economic system upon which have advance beyond all the rest of the world in order to adopt method base on principle destructive of very foundation and wish to emphasize the seriousness of these proposal wish to make position clear for this go to the very root of american life and progress should like to state to the effect that this projection of government in business would have upon system of self government and economic system that effect would reach to the daily life of every man and woman would impair the very basis of liberty and freedom not only for those leave outside the fold of expand bureaucracy but for those embrace within let first see the effect upon self government when the|federal|government undertake to go into commercial business must at once set up the organization and administration of that business and immediately find in a labyrinth every alley of which lead to the destruction of self government commercial business require a concentration of responsibility self government require decentralization and many check and balance to safeguard liberty government to succeed in business would need become in effect a despotism there at once begin the destruction of self government the first problem of the government about to adventure in commercial business be to determine a method of administration must secure leadership and direction shall this leadership be choose by political agency or shall make elective the hard practical fact be that leadership in business must come through the sheer rise in ability and character that rise can only take place in the free atmosphere of competition competition be close by bureaucracy political agency be feeble channel through which to select able leader to conduct commercial business government in order to avoid the possible incompetence corruption and tyranny of too great authority in individual entrust with commercial business inevitably turn to board and commission to make sure that there be check and balance each member of such board and commission must have equal authority each have separate responsibility to the public and at once have the conflict of idea and the lack of decision which would ruin any commercial business have contribute greatly to the demoralization of shipping business moreover these commission must be representative of different section and different political party so that at once have an entire blight upon coordinated action within rank which destroy any possibility of effective administration moreover legislative body can not in fact delegate full authority to commission or to individual for the conduct of matter vital to the american people for if would preserve government by the people must preserve the authority of legislator in the activity of government thus every time go into a commercial business senators and congressmen become the actual board of director of that business every time a state government go into business or two|hundred state senator and legislator become the actual director of that business even if be superman and if there be no politic in the|united|state no body of such number could competently direct commercial activity for that require initiative instant decision and action take congress six|year of constant discussion to even decide what the method of administration of muscle|shoal should be when the|federal|government undertake to go into business the state government be at once deprive of control and taxation of that business when a state government undertake to go into business at once deprive the municipality of taxation and control of that business municipality be local and close to the people can at time succeed in business where federal|and|state|government must fail have trouble enough with log roll in legislative body today originate naturally from desire of citizen to advance particular section or to secure some necessary service would be multiply a thousandfold be the federal and state government in these business the effect upon economic progress would be even bad business progressiveness be dependent on competition new method and new idea be the outgrowth of the spirit of adventure of individual initiative and of individual enterprise without adventure there be no progress no government administration can rightly take chance with taxpayer ' money there be no well example of the practical incompetence of government to conduct business than the history of railway during the war the government find necessary to operate the railway that operation continue until after the war in the|year before be free from government operation be not able to meet the demand for transportation eight|years|later find under private enterprise transport more good and meet every demand for service rate have be reduce by and net earning increase from less|than|1|per|cent on valuation to about|5|per|cent wage of employee have improve by the wage of railway employee be today above pre - war while the wage of government employee be today only|65 per cent above pre - war that should be a sufficient commentary upon the efficiency of government operation let now examine this question from the point of view of the person who may get a government job and be admit into the new bureaucracy upon that subject let quote from a speech of that great leader of labor samuel|gomper deliver in montreal in a|few|year before death say believe there be no man to whom would take second position in loyalty to and yet would not give more power over the individual citizenship of country be a question of whether shall be government ownership or private ownership under control if be in the minority of in this convention would want to cast vote so that the man of labor shall not willingly enslave to government authority in industrial effort for freedom let the future tell the story of who be right or who be wrong who have stand for freedom and who have be willing to submit fate industrially to the government would amplify mr. gompers ' statement the great body of government employee which would be create by the proposal of opponent would either comprise a political machine at the disposal of the party in power or alternatively to prevent this the government by stringent civil service rule must debar employee from full political right as free man must limit in the liberty to bargain for own wage for no government employee can strike against government and thus against the whole people make a legislative body with all political current final employer and master bargaining do not rest upon economic need or economic strength but on political potence but what of those who be outside the bureaucracy what be the effect upon life the area of enterprise and opportunity for to strive and rise be at once limited the government in commercial business do not tolerate amongst customer the freedom of competitive reprisal to which private business be subject bureaucracy do not tolerate the spirit of independence spread the spirit of submission into daily life and penetrate the temper of people not with the habit of powerful resistance to wrong but with the habit of timid acceptance of irresistible might bureaucracy be ever desirous of spread influence and power can not extend the mastery of the government over the|daily work life of a people without at the same time make the master of the people 's soul and thought every expansion of government in business mean that government in order to protect from the political consequence of error and wrong be drive irresistibly without peace to great and great control of the nation ' press and platform free speech do not live many|hour after free industry and free commerce die be a false liberalism that interpret into the government operation of commercial business every step of bureaucratizing of the business of country poison the very root of liberalism that is political equality free speech free assembly free press and equality of opportunity be the road not to more liberty but to less liberty liberalism should be find not strive to spread bureaucracy but strive to set bound to true liberalism seek all legitimate freedom first in the confident belief that without such freedom the pursuit of all other blessing and benefit be vain that belief be the foundation of all american progress political as well as economic liberalism be a force truly of the spirit a force proceed from the deep realization that economic freedom can not be sacrifice if political freedom be to be preserve even if governmental conduct of business could give more efficiency instead of less efficiency the fundamental objection to would remain unaltered and unabated would destroy political equality would increase rather than decrease abuse and corruption would stifle initiative and invention would undermine the development of leadership would cramp and cripple the mental and spiritual energy of people would extinguish equality and opportunity would dry up the spirit of liberty and progress for these reason primarily must be resist for a|hundred|and|fifty|year liberalism have find true spirit in the american system not in the european system do not wish to be misunderstood in this statement be define a general policy do not mean that government be to part with iota of national resource without complete protection to the public interest have already state that where the government be engage in public work for purpose of flood control of navigation of irrigation of scientific research or national defense or in pioneer a new art will at time necessarily produce power or commodity as a by product but must be a by product of the major purpose not the major purpose nor do wish to be misinterpret as believe that the|united|states be free for all and devil take the hind most the very essence of equality of opportunity and of american individualism be that there shall be no domination by any group or combination in this republic whether be business or political on the contrary demand economic justice as well as political and social justice be no system of feel deeply on this subject because during the war have some practical experience with governmental operation and control have witness not only at home but abroad the many failure of government in business have see tyranny injustice destruction of self government undermining of the very instinct which carry people forward to progress have witness the lack of advance the lower standard of living the depressed spirit of people work under such a system objection be base not upon theory or upon a failure to recognize wrong or abuse but know the adoption of such method would strike at the very root of american life and would destroy the very basis of american progress people have the right to know whether can continue to solve great problem without abandonment of american system know can have demonstrate that system be responsive enough to meet any new and intricate development in economic and business life have demonstrate that can meet any economic problem and still maintain democracy as master in own house and that can at the same time preserve equality of opportunity and individual freedom in the|last|fifty|years have discover that mass production will produce article for at half the cost require previously have see the resultant growth of large unit of production and distribution this be big business many business must be big for tool be big country be big now build a single dynamo of a|hundred|thousand|horsepower even that would have be a big business all by yet today advance in production require that set of these unit together in a row the american people from bitter experience have a rightful fear that great business unit may be use to dominate industrial life and by illegal and unethical practice destroy equality of opportunity years|ago the|republican|administration establish the principle that such evil could be correct by regulation develop method by which abuse could be prevent while the full value of industrial progress could be retain for the public insist upon the principle that when great public utility be clothe with the security of partial monopoly whether be railway power plant telephone or what not then there must be the full and most complete control of rate service and finance by government or local agency declare that these business must be conduct with glass pocket as to great manufacturing and distribute industry insist up on the enactment of law that not only would maintain competition but would destroy conspiracy to destroy the small unit or dominate and limit the equality of opportunity amongst people of the great problem of government be to determine to what extent the government shall regulate and control commerce and industry and how much shall leave alone no system be perfect have have many abuse in the private conduct of business that every good citizen resent be just as important that business keep out of government as that government keep out of business nor be set up the contention that institution be perfect no human ideal be ever perfectly attain since humanity be not perfect the wisdom of forefather in conception that progress can only be attain as the sum of the accomplishment of free individual have be re - enforce by all of the great leader of the country since that|day jackson lincoln cleveland mckinley roosevelt wilson and coolidge have stand unalterably for these principle and what have be the result of american system country have become the land of opportunity to those bear without inheritance not merely because of the wealth of resource and industry but because of this freedom of initiative and enterprise russia have natural resource equal to people be equally industrious but have not have the blessing of of form of government and of social system by adherence to the principle of decentralized self government order liberty equal opportunity and freedom to the individual american experiment in human welfare have yield a degree of well being unparalleled in all the world have come nearer to the abolition of poverty to the abolition of fear of want than humanity have ever reach before progress of be the proof of this alone furnish the answer to opponent who ask to introduce destructive element into the system by which this have be accomplish let see what this system have do for in our|recent|years of difficult and try reconstruction and let then solemnly ask if now wish to abandon as a nation come out of the war with great loss make no profit from the apparent increase in wage be at that time fictitious be poor as a nation when emerge from the war yet

conquer the disability of public finance while obligation to veteran and dependent be large and continue the heavy burden of the national debt be be steadily eliminate at the|end|of|this|fiscal|year will be reduce from about|$26,600,000,000 to about|$17,975,000,000 annual interest include war saving will have be reduce from the sacrifice of the people the economy of the government be show remarkable result should be continue for the purpose of relieve the nation of the burden of interest and debt and release revenue for internal improvement and national development not only the amount but the rate of government interest have be reduce callable bond have be refund and pay so that during this|year the average rate of interest on the present public debt for the first time fall below keep the credit of the nation high be a tremendously profitable operation tax reduction the immediate fruit of economy and the retirement of the public debt be tax reduction the annual saving in

increase until people make but individual taxable return so that further reduction should be mainly for the purpose of remove inequality the secretary of the treasury have recommend a measure which would give a much better balanced system of taxation and without oppression produce sufficient revenue have complete support unforeseen contingency require money be always arise probable surplus for june|30,|1929 be small a slight depression in business would greatly reduce revenue because of present method of taxation the people ought to take no selfish attitude of press for remove moderate and fair taxis which may produce a deficit must keep budget balance for each|year that be the corner stone of national credit the trifling price pay to command the low rate of interest of any great power in the world any surplus can be apply to debt reduction and debt reduction be tax reduction under the present circumstance would be far well to leave the rate as be than to enact a bill carry the peril of a deficit this be not a problem to be approach in a narrow or partisan spirit all of those who participate in find a reasonable solution will be entitle to participate in any credit that accrue from without regard to party the congress have already demonstrate that tax legislation can be remove from purely political consideration into the realm of patriotic business principle any bill for tax reduction should be write by those who be responsible for raise managing and expend the finance of the government if special interest too often selfish always uninformed of the national need as a whole with hire agent use propose beneficiary as engine of propaganda be permit to influence the withdrawal of property from taxation shall have a law that be unbalanced and unjust bad for business bad for the country probably result in a deficit with disastrous financial consequences the constitution have give the member of the congress sole authority to decide what tax measure shall be present for approval while welcome information from any|quarter the congress should continue to exercise own judgment in a matter so vital and important to all the interest of the country as taxation national|defense be a nation rely not on force but on fair dealing and good will to maintain peace with other have provide a moderate military force in a form adapt solely to defense should be continue with a very generous supply of officer and with the present base of personnel subject to fluctuation which may be temporarily desirable the year program for air force be in keep with this same policy and commensurate with the notable contribution of america to the science of aeronautic the provision of the law lately enact be be execute as fast as the practical difficulty of an orderly and stable development permit while army be small prudence require that should be keep in a high state of efficiency and provide with such supply as would permit of immediate expansion the garrison

wartime training camp be become poorly house in the|past|three|years have be appropriate for reconstruction and repair and an authorization have be approve of for new housing under which have already be appropriate a law have also be pass comply with the request of the|war|department allocate fund receive from the sale of building and land for housing purpose the work however be not complete so that other appropriation be be recommend navy be likewise a weapon of defense have a foreign commerce and ocean line of trade unsurpasse by any other country have outlying territory in the great ocean and long stretch of seacoast stud with the rich city in the world be responsible for the protection of a large population and the great treasure ever bestow upon any people be charge with an international duty of defend the|panama|canal to meet these responsibility need a very substantial sea armament need aircraft development which be be provide under the year program need submarine as soon as the department decide upon the good type of construction need airplane carrier and a material addition to force of cruiser can plan for the future and begin a moderate building program this country have put away the old|world policy of competitive armament can never be relieve of the responsibility of adequate national defense have treaty secure by an unprecedented attitude of generosity on part for a limitation in naval armament after most careful preparation extend over month recently make every effort to secure a power treaty to the same end be grant much cooperation by japan but be unable to come to an agreement with great|britain while the result of the conference be of considerable value be mostly of a negative character know now that no agreement can be reach which will be inconsistent with a considerable building program on part be ready and willing to continue the preparatory investigation on the general subject of limitation of armament which have be start under the auspex of have a considerable cruiser tonnage but a part of be obsolete everyone know that have a power agreement be reach would have leave with the necessity of continue building program the failure to agree should not cause to build either more or less than otherwise should any future treaty of limitation will call on for more ship should enter on no competition should refrain from no needful program should be make clear to all the world that lack a definite agreement the attitude of any other country be not to be permit to alter own policy should especially be demonstrate that propaganda will not cause to change course where there be no treaty limitation the size of the navy which america be to have will be solely for america to determine no outside influence should enlarge or diminish but should be know to all that military power hold no threat of aggrandizement be a guaranty of peace and security at home and when go abroad be an instrument for the protection of the legal right of citizen under international law a refuge in time of disorder and always the servant of world peace wherever flag go the right of humanity increase merchant marine the|united|states|government fleet be transport a large amount of freight and reduce drain on the treasury the|shipping|board be constantly under pressure to which too often yield to protect private interest rather than serve the public welfare more attention should be give to merchant ship as an auxiliary of the navy the possibility of include master and crew in the|naval|reserve with some reasonable compensation should be thoroughly explore as a method of encourage private operation of shipping public operation be not a success no investigation of which have cause several to be make have fail to report that could not succeed or to recommend speedy transfer to private ownership exporter and importer be both indifferent about use american ship should be policy to keep present vessel in repair and dispose of as rapidly as possible rather than undertake any new construction operation be a burden on the|national|treasury for which be not receive sufficient benefit commercial aviation a rapid growth be take place in aeronautic the|department|of|commerce have charge of the inspection and licensing system and the construction of national airway almost|8,000|mile be already complete and about|4,000|mil more contemplated nearly|4,400|mile be now equip and more will have lighting and emergency landing field by air mail contract be expect to cover of these line daily airway flying be nearly|15,000|miles and be expect to reach 25,000|miles early|next|year flight for other purpose exceed 22,000|mil each day over airport complete and uncompleted have be lay out the demand for aircraft have greatly increase the policy already adopt by the congress be produce the sound development of this come industry western hemisphere air mail private enterprise be show much interest in opening up aviation service to mexico and central and south|america be particularly solicitous to have the|united|state take a leading part in this development be understand that the government of sister country would be willing to cooperate physical feature the undeveloped state of transportation make an air service especially adaptable to usage the|post|office|department should be grant power to make liberal long term contract for carry mail and authority should be give to the army and the navy to detail aviator and plane to cooperate with private enterprise in establish such mail service with the consent of the country concern a committee of the cabinet will later present a report on this subject good roads the importance and benefit of good road be more and more come to be appreciate the|national|government have be make liberal contribution to encourage construction the result and benefit have be very gratifying national participation however should be confine to trunk line system the national tax on automobile be now nearly sufficient to meet this outlay this tax be very small and on low price car be not or each year while the advantage of have good road be very large the desire for improved highway be not limit to own country should and do include all the|western|hemisphere the principal point in canada be already accessible ought to lend encouragement in any way can for more good road to all the principal point in this hemisphere south of the|rio|grande have be practice to supply these country with military and naval adviser when have request to assist in national defense the art of peace be even more important to and to authority should be give by law to provide at request with engineering adviser for the construction of road and bridge in some of these country already wonderful progress be be make in road building but the engineering feature be often very exacting and the financing difficult private interest should look with favor on all reasonable loan seek by these country to open such main line of travel this general subject have be promote by the pan american congress of highways which will convene again at rio|de|janeiro in july,|1928 be desirable that the congress should provide for the appointment of delegate to represent the government of the|united|state cuban parcel post have a temporary parcel post convention with cuba the advantage of be all on side during ship time as many parcel weigh time as much as receive this convention be make on the understanding that would repeal an old law prohibit the importation of cigar and cigarette in quantity less|than|3,000 enact in to discourage smuggling for which have long be unnecessary this law unjustly discriminate against an important industry of cuba repeal have be recommend by the treasury and post|office|department unless this be do merchant and railroad will find deprive of this large parcel post business after the|1st|of|next|march the date of the expiration of the convention which have be extend upon the specific understanding that would expire at that time unless this legislation be enact purchase large quantity of tobacco make in cuba be not probable that purchase would be any large if this law be repeal while would be an advantage to many other industry in the|united|state insular possession condition in the|philippine|island have be steadily improve contentment and good order prevail road irrigation work harbor improvement and public building be be construct public education and sanitation have be advance the government be in a sound financial condition these immediate result be especially due to the administration of gov. gen. leonard|wood the|six|year of governorship mark a distinct improvement in the island and rank as of the outstanding accomplishment of this distinguished man death be a loss to the nation and the island great progress could be make more efficiency could be put into administration if the congress would undertake to expend through appropriate power all or a part of the custom revenue which be now turn over to the philippine treasury the power of the auditor of the island also need revision and clarification the government of the island be about|98|per|cent in the hand of the filipinos an extension of the policy of self government will be hasten by the demonstration on part of desire and ability to carry out cordially and efficiently the provision of the organic law enact by the congress for the government of the island would be well for a committee of the congress to visit the island every|two|year a fair degree of progress be be make in porto|rico agricultural product be increase treasury position which have give much concern show improvement be advise by the governor that educational facility be still lack road be be construct which represent be the first requisite for building schoolhouse the loyalty of the island to the|united|state be exceedingly gratify a memorial will be present to request authority to have the governor elect by the people of porto|rico this be never do in the case of own territories be admit that education outside of the town be as yet very deficient until have progress further the efficiency of the government and the happiness of the people may need the guide hand of an appoint governor as be not contemplate that any change should be make immediately the general subject may well have the thoughtful study of the congress panama canal the number of commercial ship pass through the|panama|canal have increase from in to in the total amount of toll turn into the treasury be over|$166,000,000 while all the operation of the canal have yield a surplus of about|$80,000,000 in order to provide additional storage of water and give some control over the flood of the|chagres|river be propose to erect a dam to cost about|$12,000,000 at alhajuela will take some|five|years to complete this work agriculture the|past|year have see a marked improvement in the general condition of agriculture production be better balanced and without acute shortage or heavy surplus cost have be reduce and the average output of the worker increase the level of farm price have rise while other have fall so that the purchasing power of the farmer be approach a normal figure the individual farmer be entitle to great credit for the progress make since have adjust production and through cooperative organization and other method improve marketing be use authenticate fact and employ sound method which other industry be oblige to use to secure stability and prosperity the old fashioned haphazard system be be abandon economic be be apply to ascertain the good adapted unit of land diversification be be promote and scientific method be be use in production and business principle in marketing agriculture have not fully recover from postwar depression the fact be that economic progress never march forward in a straight line go in wave part go ahead while another halt and another recede everybody wish agriculture to prosper any sound and workable proposal to help the farmer will have the earnest support of the government interest be not all identical legislation should assist as many producer in as many region as possible should be the aim to assist the farmer to work out own salvation socially and economically no plan will be of any permanent value to which do not leave stand on own foundation in the past the government have spend vast sum to bring land under cultivation lt be apparent that this have reach temporarily the saturation point have have a surplus of production and a poor market for land which have only lately show sign of improvement the main problem which be present for solution be of deal with a surplus of production be useless to propose a temporary expedient what be need be permanency and stability government price fixing be know to be unsound and bind to result in disaster a government subsidy would work out in the same way can not be sound for all of the people to hire some of the people to produce a crop which neither the producer nor the rest of the people want price fixing and subsidy will both increase the surplus instead of diminish put the government directly into business be merely a combination of subsidy and price fixing aggravate by political pressure these expedient would lead logically to tell the farmer by law what and how much should plant and where should plant and what and how much should sell and where should sell the most effective mean of deal with surplus crop be to reduce the surplus acreage while this can not be do by the individual farmer can be do through the organization already in existence through the information publish by the|department|of|agriculture and especially through bank and other who supply credit refuse to finance an acreage manifestly too large be impossible to provide by law for an assured success and prosperity for all those who engage in farming if acreage become overextend the government can not assume responsibility for the government can however assist cooperative association and other organization in orderly marketing and handle a surplus clearly due to weather and seasonal condition in order to save the producer from preventable loss while be probably impossible to secure this result at a single step and much will have to be work out by trial and rejection a beginning could be make by set up a federal board or commission of able and experienced man in marketing grant equal advantage under this board to the various agricultural commodity and section of the country give encouragement to the cooperative movement in agriculture and provide a revolving loan fund at a moderate rate of interest for the necessary financing such legislation would lay the foundation for a permanent solution of the surplus problem this be not a proposal to lend more money to the farmer who be already fairly well finance but to lend money temporarily to experimental marketing association which will no doubt ultimately be finance by the regularly establish bank as be the temporary operation of the|war|finance|corporation cooperative marketing especially would be provide with mean of buying or build physical property the|national|government have almost entirely relieve the farmer from income taxis by successive tax reduction but state and local taxis have increase put on a grievous burden a policy of rigid economy should be apply to state and local expenditure this be clearly within the legislative domain of the states the|federal|government have also improve banking structure and system of agricultural credit the farmer will be greatly benefit by similar action in many states the|department|of|agriculture be undergo change in organization in order more completely to separate the research and regulatory division that each may be better administer more emphasis be be place on the research program not only by enlarge the appropriation for state experiment station but by provide fund for expand the research work of the department be in this direction that much future progress can be expect the protective tariff the present tariff rate supply the|national|treasury with well over of annual revenue yet about|65|per|cent of import come in duty free of the remain of import on which duty be lay about|23 per cent consist of luxury and agricultural product and the balance of about|12|per|cent amount to around|$560,000,000 be make up of manufacture and merchandise as no one be advocate any material reduction in the rate on agriculture or luxury be only the comparatively small amount of of other import that be really consider in any discussion of reduce tariff rate while this amount duty free would be large enough seriously to depress many line of business in own country be of small importance when spread over the rest of the world be often state that a reduction of tariff rate on industry would benefit agriculture would be interesting to know to what commodity be think this could be apply everything the farmer use in farming be already on the free list nearly everything sell be protect would seem to be obvious that be well for tile country to have the farmer raise food to supply the domestic manufacturer than the foreign manufacturer in case country would have only the farmer in the other would have the farmer and the manufacturer assume that europe would have more money if sell large amount of merchandise be not certain would consume more food or if do that purchase would be make in this country undoubtedly would resort to the cheap market which be by no means ours the large and good and most profitable market for the farmer in the world be own domestic market any great increase in manufacture import mean the closing of own plant nothing would be bad for agriculture probably no one expect a material reduction in the rate on manufacture while maintain the rate on agriculture a material reduction in either would be disastrous to tile farmer would mean a general shrinkage of value a deflation of price a reduction of wage a general depression carry people down to the low standard of live in compete country be obvious that this would not improve but destroy market for import which be best serve by maintain present high purchasing power under which in the|past|five|years import have increase farm loan system be exceedingly important that the federal land and joint stock land bank should furnish the good possible service for agriculture certain joint stock bank have fall into improper and unsound practice result in the indictment of the official of of more money have be provide for examination and at the instance of the treasury rule and regulation of the|federal|farm|board have be revise of member resign place be fill with man connect with the|war|finance|corporation being designate as farm|loan commissioner the new member have demonstrate ability in the field of agricultural finance in the extensive operation of joint stock bank have go into receivership be necessary to preserve the public confidence in this system in order to find a market for bond a recent flotation be make at a record low rate of careful supervision be absolutely necessary to protect the investor and enable these bank to exercise chief function in serve agriculture muscle shoal the|last|year have see considerable change in the problem of muscle|shoals development of other method show that nitrate can probably be produce at less cost than by the use of hydroelectric power extensive investigation make by indicate that the nitrate plant on this project be of little value for national defense and can probably be dispose of within two|year the oxidation part of the plant however should be retain indefinitely this leave this project mostly concerned with power should nevertheless continue to be dedicate to agriculture be probable that this desire can be best serve by dispose of the plant and apply the revenue receive from to research for method of more economical production of concentrated fertilizer and to demonstration and other method of stimulate use on the farm but in dispose of the property preference should be give to proposal to use all or part of for nitrate production and fertilizer manufacturing flood control for many|years the|federal|government have be build a system of dike along the|mississippi|river for protection against high water during the|past|season the low states be overcome by a most disastrous flood many|thousands|of|square|mile be inundate a great many life be lose much livestock be drown and a very heavy destruction of property be inflict upon the inhabitant at once go to the relief of the stricken community appeal for contribution have bring in over|$17,000,000 the|federal|government have provide service equipment and supply probably amount to about|$7,000,000 more between|$5,000,000|and|$10,000,000 in addition have be provide by local railroad the states and political unit credit have be arrange by the|farm|loan|board and emergency finance corporation with a total capital of have insure additional resource to the extent of through these mean the people in the flood area have be adequately support provision have be make to care for those in need until after the|1st|of|january the|engineering|corps|of|the|army have contract to close all break in the dike system before the|next|season of high water a most thorough and elaborate survey of the whole situation have be make and embody in a report with recommendation for future flood control which will be present to the congress the carrying out of plan will necessarily extend over a|series|of|year will call for a raise and strengthening of the dike system with provision for emergency spillway 's and improvement for the benefit of navigation under the present law the land adjacent to the dike have pay third of the cost of construction this have be a most extraordinary concession from the plan adopt in relation to irrigation where the general rule have be that the land benefit should bear the entire expense be true of course that the troublesome water do not originate on the land to be reclaim but be also true that such water have a right of way through that section of the country and the land there be charge with that easement be the land of this region that be to be benefit to say that be unable to bear any expense of reclamation be the same thing as say that be not worth reclaim because of expense incur and charge already hold against this land seem probable that some revision will have to be make concern the proportion of cost which should bear but be extremely important that should pay enough so that those request improvement will be charge with some responsibility for cost and the neighborhood where work be construct have a pecuniary interest in prevent waste and extravagance and secure a wise and economical expenditure of public fund be necessary to look upon this emergency as a national disaster have be so treat from inception whole people have provide with great generosity for relief most of the department of the|federal|government have be engage in the same effort the government of the afflict area both state and municipal can not be give too high praise for the courageous and helpful way in which have come to the rescue of the people if the source directly chargeable can not meet the demand the|national|government should not fail to provide generous relief this however do not mean restoration the government be not an insurer of citizen against the hazard of the element shall always have flood and drought heat and cold earthquake and wind lightning and tidal wave which be all too constant in affliction the government do not undertake to reimburse citizen for loss and damage incur under such circumstance be chargeable however with the rebuilding of public work and the humanitarian duty of relieve citizen from distress the people in the flooded area and representative have approach this problem in the most generous and broad minded way should be meet with a like spirit on the part of the national government this be all country the public need of each part must be provide for by the public at large no required relief should be refuse an adequate plan should be adopt to prevent a recurrence of this disaster in order that the people may restore to productivity and comfort field and town legislation by this congress should be confine to principal and most pressing problem the low mississippi consider tributary only so far as materially affect the main flood problem a definite federal program relate to waterway be propose when the last congress authorize a comprehensive survey of all the important stream of the country in order to provide for improvement include flood control navigation power and irrigation other legislation should wait pende a report on this survey the recognize need of the mississippi should not be make a vehicle for carry other project all proposal for development should stand on own merit any other method would result in ill advise conclusion great waste of money and instead of promote would delay the orderly and certain utilization of water resource very recently several of the|new|england|state have suffer somewhat similarly from heavy rainfall and high water no reliable estimate of damage have yet be compute but be very large to private and public property the|red|cross be generously undertake what be need for immediate relief repair and reconstruction of house restock of domestic animal and food clothing and shelter a considerable sum of money will be available through the regular channel in the|department|of|agriculture for reconstruction of highway may be necessary to grant special aid for this purpose complete report of what be require will undoubtedly be available early in the session inland navigation the congress in last session authorize the general improvement necessary to provide the mississippi waterway system with well transportation stabilization of the level of the|great|lake and opening to the sea by an effective shipway remain to be consider since the last session the|board|of|engineers|of|the|war|department have make a report on the proposal for a canal through the|state|of|new|york and the|joint|board|of|engineer represent canada and the|united|state have finish a report on both of these board conclude that the st.|lawrence project be cheap afford a more expeditious method of place western product in european market and will cost less to operate the|state|department have request the|canadian|government to negotiate treaty necessary to provide for this improvement will also be necessary to secure an agreement with canada to put in work necessary to prevent fluctuation in the level of the|great|lake legislation be desirable for the construction of a dam at boulder|canyon on the|colorado|river primarily as a method of flood control and irrigation a secondary result would be a considerable power development and a source of domestic water supply for southern california flood control be clearly a national problem and water supply be a government problem but every other possibility should be exhaust before the|federal|government become engage in the power business the states which be interested ought to reach mutual agreement this project be in reality work if wish the|federal|government to undertake should not hesitate to make the necessary concession to each other this subject be fully discuss in the annual report of the secretary of the interior the columbia|river|basin project be be study and will be to be consider at some future time the|inland|waterways|corporation be prove successful and especially beneficial to agriculture a survey be be make to determine future need have never be contemplate that if inland river be open to navigation would then be necessary for the|federal|government to provide the navigation such a request be very nearly the equivalent of a declaration that navigation be not profitable that the commodity which be to carry can be take at a cheap rate by some other method in which case the|hundreds|of|millions|of|dollar propose to be expend for open river to navigation would be not only waste but would entail further constant expenditure to carry the commodity of private person for less than cost the policy be well establish that the government should open public highway on land and on water but for use of the public in private capacity have put on some demonstration barge line but always with the expectation that if prove profitable would pass into private hand and if do not prove profitable will be withdraw the problem of transportation over inland waterway should be take up by private enterprise so that the public will have the advantage of competition in service be expect that some of line can be sell some more demonstration work do and that with the completion of the ohio project a policy of private operation can be fully develop prohibition after generation of constant debate country adopt a system of national prohibition under all the solemnity involve in an amendment to the|federal|constitution in obedience to this mandate the congress and the states with or notable exception have pass require law for administration and enforcement this impose upon the citizenship of the country and especially on all public officer not only the duty to enforce but the obligation to observe the sanction of this constitutional provision and result law if this condition could be secure all question concern prohibition would cease the|federal|government be make every effort to accomplish these result through careful organization large appropriation and administrative effort smuggling have be greatly cut down the large source of supply for illegal sale have be check and by mean of injunction and criminal prosecution the process of enforcement be be apply the same vigilance on the part of local government would render these effort much more successful the federal authority propose to discharge obligation for enforcement to the full extent of ability the negro history do not anywhere record so much progress make in the same length of time as that which have be accomplish by the negro race in the|united|state since have come up from slavery to be prominent in education the profession art science agriculture banking and commerce be estimate that of be on the government pay roll draw about|$50,000,000 each year have be the recipient of presidential appointment and professional ability have arise to a sufficiently high plane so that have be intrust with the entire management and control of the great veteran hospital at tuskegee where conduct have take high rank have show that have be worthy of all the encouragement which have receive nevertheless be too often subject to thoughtless and inconsiderate treatment unworthy alike of the white or colored race have especially be make the target of the foul crime of lynching for several|year these act of unlawful violence have be diminish in the|last|year have show an increase every principle of order and law and liberty be oppose to this crime the congress should enact any legislation can under the constitution to provide for elimination american|indian the condition of the american indian have much improve in recent|years full citizenship be bestow upon on june|2,|1924 and appropriation for care and advancement have be increase still there remain much to be do notable increase in appropriation for the several major function perform by the|department|of|the|interior on behalf of the indians have mark the|last|five|year in that time successive annual increase in appropriation for education total for medical care and for industrial advancement or more than would have be spend in the same period on the basis of appropriation for and the|preceding|years the need along health educational industrial and social line however be great and the budget estimate for include still further increase for indian administration to advance the time when the indians may become self sustain be belief that the|federal|government should continue to improve the facility for care and as rapidly as possible turn responsibility over to the states coal legislation authorize a system of fuel administration and the appointment by the president of a|board|of|mediation|and|conciliation in case of actual or threaten interruption of production be need the miner be now seek information and action from the government which could readily be secure through such a board be believe that a thorough investigation and reconsideration of this propose policy by the congress will demonstrate that this recommendation be sound and should be adopt petroleum conservation the|national|government be undertake to join in the formation of a cooperative committee of lawyer engineer and public officer to consider what legislation by the states or by the congress can be adopt for the preservation and conservation of supply of petroleum this have come to be of the main dependency for transportation and power so necessary to agricultural and industrial life be expect the report of this committee will be available for later congressional action meantime the requirement that the secretary of the interior should make certain lease of land belong to the|osage|indian in accordance with the|act|of|march|3,|1921 should be repeal the authority to lease should be discretionary in order that the property of the indians way not be waste and the public suffer a future lack of supply alien property under treaty the property hold by the|alien|property|custodian be to be retain until suitable provision have be make for the satisfaction of american claim while still protect the american claimant in order to afford every possible accommodation to the national of the country whose property be hold the congress have make liberal provision for the return of a large part of the property all trust under be return in full and partial return be make on the other the total return be approximately|$350,000,000 there be still retain however about|$250,000,000 the|mixed|claims|commission have make such progress in the adjudication of claim that legislation can now be enact provide for the return of the property which should be do under condition which will protect government and claimant such a measure will be propose and recommend enactment railroad consolidation in order to increase the efficiency of transportation and decrease cost to the shipper railroad consolidation must be secure legislation be need to simplify the necessary procedure to secure such agreement and arrangement for consolidation always under the control and with the approval of the|interstate|commerce|commission pende this no adequate or permanent reorganization can be make of the freight rate structure meantime both agriculture and industry be compel to wait for need relief this be purely a business question which should be strip of all local and partisan bias and decide on broad principle and merit in order to promote the public welfare a large amount of new construction and equipment which will furnish employment for labor and market for commodity of both factory and farm wait on the decision of this important question delay be hold back the progress of country many of the same argument be applicable to the consolidation of the washington traction company veterans the care which this country have lavish on veteran be know of all man the yearly outlay for this purpose be about|$750,000,000 or about the cost of run the|federal|government outside of the|post|office|department before the|world|war the congress will have before recommendation of the|american|legion the veterans of foreign wars and other like organization which should receive candid consideration should continue to foster system of compensation and rehabilitation and provide hospital and insurance the magnitude of the undertaking be already so large that all request call for further expenditure should have the most searching scrutiny present system of pension be already sufficiently liberal be increase by the last congress|for|civil and spanish|war veteran and widow and for some dependent have be suggest that the various governmental agency now deal with veteran ' relief be consolidate this would bring many advantage be recommend that the proper committee of the congress make a thorough survey of this subject in order to determine if legislation to secure such consolidation be desirable education for many|years have be the policy of the|federal|government to encourage and foster the cause of education large sum of money be annually appropriate to carry on vocational training many million go into agricultural school the general subject be under the immediate direction of a commissioner of education while this subject be strictly a state and local function should continue to have the encouragement of be still of the opinion that much good could be accomplish through the establishment of a department|of|education and relief into which would be gather all of these function under direct member of the cabinet department of labor industrial relation have never be more peaceful in recent|month have suffer from only|one serious controversy in all other difficulty have be adjust both management and labor wish to settle controversy by friendly agreement rather than by compulsion the welfare of woman and child be be especially guard by department|of|labor children's|bureau be in cooperation with state board and juvenile court through bureau|of|immigration ba be find that medical examination abroad have save prospective immigrant from much hardship some further legislation to provide for reunite family when either the husband or the wife be in this country and grant more freedom for the migration of the north|american indian tribe be desirable the|united|states|employment|service have enable man and woman to gain pay position in the|last|fiscal|year particular attention have be give to assist man past middle life and in provide field labor for harvest agricultural crop this have be make possible in part through the service of the|federal|board|for|vocational|education which be cooperate with the states in a program to increase the technical knowledge and skill of the wage earner public building construction be under way in the country and ground have be break for carry out a public building program for washington have reach a time when not only the convenience but the architectural beauty of the public building of the|capital|city should be give much attention will be necessary to purchase further land and provide the require continue appropriation historical celebration provision be be make to commemorate the hundredth anniversary of the birth of george|washington suggestion have be make for the construction of a memorial road lead from the capital to mount|vernon which may well have the consideration of the congress and the commission intrust with preparation for the celebration will undoubtedly recommend publication of the complete writing of washington and a series of writing by different author relate to february|25,|1929 be the one|hundred|and|fiftieth anniversary of the capture of fort|sackville at vincennes in the|state of indiana this eventually bring into the union what be know as the|northwest|territory embrace the region north of the|ohio|river between the alleghenies and this expedition be lead by george|rogers|clark heroic character and the importance of victory be too little know and understand give not only this northwest territory but by mean of that the prospect of reach the pacific the|state of indiana be propose to dedicate the site of fort|sackville as a national shrine the|federal|government may well make some provision for the erection under own management of a fitting memorial at that point foreign relation be the policy of the|united|state to promote peace be a peaceful people and commit to the settling of dispute by amicable adjustment rather than by force have believe that peace can best be secure by a faithful observance on part of the principle of international law accompany by patience and conciliation and require of other a like treatment for have lately have some difference with mexico relative to the injury inflict upon national and property within that country a firm adherence to right and a scrupulous respect for the sovereignty of mexico both in accordance with the law of nation couple with patience and forbearance be hope will resolve all difference without interfere with the friendly relationship between the government have be compel to send naval and marine force to china to protect the life and property of citizen fortunately simple presence there have be sufficient to prevent any material loss of life but there have be considerable loss of property that unhappy country be tear by faction and revolution which bid fair to last for an indefinite period meanwhile be protect citizen and stand ready to cooperate with any government which may emerge in promote the welfare of the people of china have always have friendship and should especially merit consideration in these|day of distraction and distress be confront by similar condition on a small scale in nicaragua marine and naval force protect citizen and property and prevent a heavy sacrifice of life and the destruction of that country by a reversion to a state of revolution henry|l.|stimson former secretary of war be

would be protect by give assistance in the conduct of the next presidential election which occur in a|few|month with this assurance the population return to peacetime pursuit with the exception of

be not so much new policy as a steady continuation of those which be already be crown with such abundant success can not be too often repeat that in common with all the world be engage in liquidate the war in the present short session no great amount of new legislation be possible but in order to comprehend what be most desirable some survey of general situation be necessary a large amount of

the|end|of|this|fiscal|year will leave a surplus in the treasury estimate at unless otherwise order such surplus be use for the retirement of the war debt a bond which can be retire today for will cost the people to retire a|year|from|now while favor a speedy reduction of the debt as already require by law and in accordance with the promise make to the holder of liberty bond when be issue there be no reason why a balanced portion of surplus revenue should not be apply to a reduction of taxation can not be repeat too often that the enormous revenue of this nation could not be collect without become a charge on all the people whether or not directly pay taxis everyone who be pay or the bare necessity of fool and shelter and clothing without consider the well thing of life be indirectly pay

permit believe in a reduction of taxation think the taxpayer be entitle to but be not advocate tax reduction merely for the benefit of the taxpayer be advocate for the benefit of the country if appear feasible should welcome permanent tax reduction at this time the estimated surplus however for june|30,|1928 be not much large than be require in a go business of nearly|$4,000,000,000 have have but a|few|month ' experience under the present revenue act and shall need to know what be develop by the return of income produce under which be not require t o be make until about the time this session terminate and what the economic probability of the country be in the latter part of before can reach any justifiable conclusion as to permanent tax reduction moreover the present surplus result from many nonrecurrent item meantime be possible to grant some real relief by a simple measure make reduction in the payment which accrue on the|15th|of|march and june be very strongly of the conviction that this be so much a purely business matter that ought not to be deal with in a partisan spirit the congress have already set the notable example of treat tax problem without much reference to party which may well be continue what desire to advocate most earnestly be relief for the country from unnecessary tax burden can not secure that if stop to engage in a partisan controversy as do not think any change in the special taxis or tiny permanent reduction be practical therefore urge both party of the|house|ways|and|means|committee to agree on a bill grant the temporary relief which have indicate such a reduction would directly affect million of taxpayer release large sum for investment in new enterprise stimulate industrial production and agricultural consumption and indirectly benefit every family in the whole country these be conviction state with full knowledge that be for the congress to decide whether judge best to make such a reduction or leave the surplus for the|present|year to be apply to retirement of the war debt that also be eventually tax reduction protective tariff be estimate that custom receipt for the|present|fiscal|year will exceed the large which be ever secure from that source the value of import for the|last|fiscal|year be an increase of more than per cent since the present tariff law go into effect of these import about|65 per cent or roughly come in free of duty which mean that the|united|states afford a duty free market to other country almost equal in value to the total import of germany and greatly exceed the total import of france have admit a great volume of free import than any other country except england be therefore levy duty on about|$1,550,000,000 of import of this or be subject to duty for the protection of agriculture and have origin in country other than europe substantially increase the price receive by farmer for produce about|$300,000.000 more be represent by luxury such as costly rug fur precious stone this leave of import under a schedule of duty which be in general under consideration when there be discussion of lower the tariff while the duty on this small portion represent only|about|12 per cent of import undoubtedly represent the difference between a fair degree of prosperity or mark depression to many of industry and the difference between good pay and steady work or wide unemployment to many of wage earner be impossible to conceive how other country or own importer could be greatly benefit if these duty be reduce those who be start an agitation for a reduction of tariff duty partly at least for the benefit of those to whom money have be lend abroad ought to know that there do not seem to be a very large field within the area of import in which probable reduction would be advantageous to foreign good those who wish to benefit foreign producer be much more likely to secure that result by continue the present enormous purchasing power which come from prosperity that hall increase import over per cent in four|year than from any advantage that be likely to accrue from a general tariff reduction agriculture the important place which agriculture hold in the economic and social life of the nation can not be overestimate the|national|government be justify in put forth every effort to make the open country a desirable place to live no condition meet this requirement which fail to supply a fair return on labor expended and capital invest while some locality and some particular crop furnish exception in general agriculture be continue to make progress in recover from the depression of and animal product and food product be in a more encouraging position while cotton due to the high price of past|years supplement by ideal weather condition have be stimulate to a point of temporary over production act on the request of the cotton grow interest appoint a committee to assist in carry out plan as result of this cooperation sufficient fund have be pledge to finance the storage and carrying of 4,000,000|bale of cotton whether those who own the cotton be willing to put a part of stock into this plan depend on the|federal|government have cooperate in provide ample facility no method of meet the situation would be adequate which do not contemplate a reduction of about|one third in the acreage for the|coming|year the responsibility for make the plan effective lie with those who own and finance cotton and cotton land the|department|of|agriculture estimate the net income of agriculture for the|year|1920 at for for this increase have be bring about in part by the method already refer to of federal tax reduction the elimination of waste and increase efficiency in industry the wide gap that exist a|few|years|ago between the index price of agricultural product and the index price of other product have be gradually close up though the recent depression in cotton have somewhat enlarge agriculture have on the whole be go high while industry have be grow low industrial and commercial activity be carry on for the most part by corporation be tax at a much high rate than farming which be carry on by individual this will inevitably make industrial commodity cost high while war taxation last be because of this circumstance that national tax reduction have a very large indirect benefit upon the farmer though can not relieve from the very great burden of the local taxis which pay directly have practically relieve the farmer of any federal income tax there be agreement on all side that some portion of agricultural industry have lag behind other industry in recovery from the war and that further improvement in method of marketing of agricultural product be most desirable there be belief also that the|federal|government can further contribute to these end beyond the many helpful measure take during the|last|five|year through the different act of congress for advance the interest of the farmer the packer and stockyard act establish of the intermediate credit bank for agricultural purpose the|purnell|act for agricultural research the|capper volstead|cooperative|marketing|act the cooperative marketing act of amendment to the warehousing act the enlargement of the activity of the|department|of|agriculture enlargement of the scope of loan by the|farm|loan|board the tariff on agricultural product the large federal expenditure in improvement of waterway and highway the reduction of federal taxis in all comprise a great series of governmental action in the advancement of the special interest of agriculture in determination of what further measure may be undertake seem to there be certain pitfall which must be avoid and test in avoid should be to avoid disaster to the farmer act upon recommendation the congress have order the interstate commerce|commission to investigate the freight rate structure direct that such change shall be make in freight rate as will promote freedom of movement of agricultural product railroad consolidation which be advocate would also result in a situation where rate could be make more advantageous for farm produce as have recently be do in the revision of rate on fertilizer in the south additional benefit will accrue from the development of inland waterway the mississippi|river system carry a commerce of over|50,000,000|tons at a saving of nearly|$18,000,000 annually the|inland|waterways|corporation operate boat on of navigable stream and through relation with railroad carry freight into and out of 45|states of the union during the|past|six|month have handle of grain monthly and by low freight rate have raise the price of such grain to the farmer probably 3|cent a bushel the highway system on which the|federal|government expend about|$85,000,000 a year be of vital importance to the rural region the advantage to be derive from a more comprehensive and less expensive system of transportation for agriculture ought to be supplement by provision for an adequate supply of fertilizer at a low cost than be at present obtainable this advantage be attempt to secure by the propose development at muscle|shoal and there be promising experiment be make in synthetic chemistry for the production of nitrate a survey should be make of the relation of government grazing land to the livestock industry additional legislation be desirable more definitely to establish the place of grazing in the administration of the national forest properly subordinate to function of produce timber and conserve the water supply over|180,000,000|acre of grazing land be still pasture as common in the public domain with little or no regulation this have make use so uncertain that have contribute greatly to the instability of the livestock industry very little of this land be suit to settlement or private ownership some plan ought to be adopt for use in grazing correspond broadly to that already successfully apply to the national forest the development of sound and strong cooperative association be of fundamental importance to agriculture be encouraging to note therefore that a vigorous and healthy growth in the cooperative movement be continue cooperative association report to the|department|of|agriculture at the|end|of|1925 have on membership roll a total of producer total business in amount to approximately|$2,400,000,000 compare with in legislative action to assist cooperative association and supplement effort be pass at the last session of congress important credit measure be also provide by congress in which have be of inestimable value to the cooperative association although the federal credit agency have serve agriculture well think may be possible to broaden and strengthen the service of these institution attention be again direct to the surplus problem of agriculture by the present cotton situation surplus often affect price of various farm commodity in a disastrous manner and the problem urgently demand a solution discussion both in and out of congress during the|past|few|year have give a well understanding of the subject and be hope that out of the various proposal make the basis will be find for a sound and effective solution upon which agreement can be reach in opinion cooperative marketing association will be important aid to the ultimate solution of the problem may well be however that additional measure will be need to supplement effort believe all will agree that such measure should not conflict with the good interest of the cooperative but rather assist and strengthen in work out this problem to any sound conclusion be necessary to avoid put the government into the business of production or marketing or attempt to enact legislation for the purpose of price fixing the farmer do not favor any attempt remedy that partake of these element have a sincere and candid desire for assistance if match by an equally sincere and candid consideration of the different remedy propose a sound measure of relief ought to result be unfortunate that no general agreement have be reach by the various agricultural interest upon any of the propose remedy out of the discussion of various proposal which can be have before the committees of agriculture some measure ought to be perfect which would be generally satisfactory due to the emergency arise from a heavy tropical storm in southern florida authorize the secretary of agriculture to use certain fund in anticipation of legislation to enable the farmer in that region to plant crop the department will present a bill ratify the loan which be make for this purpose federal legislation have be adopt authorize the cooperation of and private owner in the protection of forest land from fire this preventive measure be of such great importance that have recommend for an increase appropriation another preventive measure of great economic and sanitary importance be the eradication of tuberculosis in cattle active work be now in progress in fourth of the county of the|united|state to secure this result over cattle have be under treatment and the average degree of infection have fall from to federal|government be make substantial expenditure for this purpose serious damage be threaten to the corn crop by the european corn borer since have spread from eastern new|england westward into indiana and now cover about|100,000|square|mile be of the most formidable pest because spread rapidly and be exceedingly difficult of control have assume a menace that be of national magnitude and warrant the|federal|government in extend cooperation to the state and local agency which be attempt to prevent further spread and secure eradication the whole question of agriculture need most careful consideration in the|past|few|year the government have give this subject more attention than any other and have hold more consultation in relation to than on any other subject while the government be not to be blame for failure to perform the impossible the agricultural region be entitle to know that have constant solicitude and sympathy many of the farmer be burden with debt and taxis which be unable to carry be expend in this country many millions|of|dollar each|year to increase farm production ought now to put more emphasis on the question of farm marketing if a sound solution of a permanent nature can be find for this problem the congress ought not to hesitate to adopt development of water resource in previous message have refer to the national importance of the proper development of water resource the great project of extension of the mississippi system the protection an development of the low colorado|river be before congress and have previously comment upon favor the necessary legislation to expedite these project engineering study be be make for connect the|great|lake with the north|atlantic either through an all american canal or by way of these report will undoubtedly be before the congress during present session be unnecessary to dwell upon the great importance of such a waterway not only to mid - continental basin but to the commerce and development of practically the whole nation river and harbor improvement should be continue in accordance with the present policy expenditure of this character be compatible with economy be in the nature of capital investment work should proceed on the basic trunk line if this work be to be a success if the country will be content to be moderate and patient and permit improvement to be make where will do the great general good rather than insist on expenditure at this time on secondary project internal waterways can be make a success if propose legislation result in a gross manifestation of local jealousy and selfishness this program can not be carry out ultimately can take care of extension but first effort should be confine to the main artery inland commerce have be put to great inconvenience and expense by reason of the lowering of the water level of the|great|lake this be an international problem on which competent engineer be make report out of study be expect that a feasible method will be develop for raise the level to provide relief for commerce and supply water for drainage whenever a practical plan be present ought to be speedily adopt reclamation be increasingly evident that the|federal|government must in the future take a leading part in the impounding of water for conservation with incidental power for the development of the irrigable land of the and region the unused water of the west be find mainly in large river work to store and distribute these have such magnitude and cost that be not attractive to private enterprise water be the irreplaceable natural resource precipitation can not be increase storage on the high reach of stream to meet grow need to be use repeatedly as flow toward the sea be a practical and prudent business policy the|united|state promise to follow the course of old irrigation country where recent important irrigation development have be carry out as national undertaking be gratify therefore that condition on federal reclamation project have become satisfactory the gross value of crop grow with water from project work increase from in to in the adjustment make last|year by congress relieve irrigator from pay construction cost on unprofitable land and by so do inspire new hope and confidence in ability to meet the payment require construction payment by water user last|year be the large in the history of the bureau the anticipate reclamation fund will be fully absorb for a|number|of|year in the completion of old project and the construction of project inaugurate in should however continue to investigate and study the possibility of a carefully plan development of promising project logically of governmental concern because of physical magnitude immense cost and the interstate and international problem involve only in this way may be fully prepared to meet intelligently the need of fast grow population in the|year to come transportation would be difficult to conceive of any modern activity which contribute more to the necessity and convenience of life than transportation without present agricultural production and practically all of commerce would be completely prostrate of the large contributing cause to the present highly satisfactory state of economic condition be the prompt and dependable service surpass all previous record render by the railroad this power have be foster by the spirit of cooperation between federal|and|state regulatory commission to render this service more efficient and effective and to promote a more scientific regulation the process of value railroad property should be simplify and the primary valuation should be complete as rapidly as possible the problem of rate reduction would be much simplify by a process of railroad consolidation this principle have already be adopt as federal law experience have show that a more effective method must be provide study have already be make and legislation introduce seek to promote this end would be of great advantage if could be take up at once and speedily enact the railroad system of the country and the convenience of all the people be wait on this important decision merchant marine be axiomatic that no agricultural and industrial country can get the full benefit of own advantage without a merchant marine have be proceed under the act of congress that contemplate the establishment of trade route to be ultimately transfer to private ownership and operation due to temporary condition abroad and at home have a large demand just now for certain type of freight vessel some suggestion have be make for new construction do not feel that be yet warrant in enter that field such ship as may build could not be sell after be launch for anywhere near what would cost have expend over|$250,000,000 out of the public treasury in recent|years to make up the loss of operation not count the depreciation or any cost whatever of capital investment the great need of merchant marine be not for more ship but for more freight merchant be altogether too indifferent about use american ship for the transportation of good which send abroad or bring home some of vessel necessarily need repair which should be make do not believe that the operation of fleet be as economical and efficient as could be make if place under a single responsible head leave the|shipping|board free to deal with general matter of policy and regulation radio legislation the|department|of|commerce have for some|years urgently present the necessity for further legislation in order to protect radio listener from interference between broadcasting station and to carry out other regulatory function both branch of congress at the last session pass enactment intend to effect such regulation but the bill yet remain to be bring into agreement and final passage due to decision of the court the authority of the department under the law of have break down many more station have be operate than can be accommodate within the limited number of wave length available further station be in course of construction many station have depart from the scheme of allocation set down by the department and the whole service of this most important public function have drift into such chaos as seem likely if not remedie to destroy great value most urgently recommend that this legislation should be speedily enact do not believe be desirable to set tip further independent agency in the government rather believe advisable to entrust the important function of decide who shall exercise the privilege of radio transmission and under what condition the assigning of wave length and determination of power to a board to be assemble whenever action on such question become necessary there should be right of appeal to the court from the decision of such board the administration of the decision of the board and the other feature of regulation and promotion of radio in the public interest together with scientific research should remain in the|department|of|commerce such an arrangement make for more expert more efficient and more economical administration that an independent agency or board whose duty after initial stage require but little attention in which administrative function be confuse with semijudicial function and from which of necessity there must be greatly increase personnel and expenditure the wage earner the great body of people be make up of wage earner several|hundred|thousand of be on the pay roll of the|united|states|government condition very largely be fix by legislation have recently provide increase in compensation under a method of reclassification and give the advantage of a liberal retirement system as a support for decline year most of be under the merit system which be a guaranty of intelligence and the efficiency of service be a demonstration of loyalty the|federal|government should continue to set a good example for all other employer in the industry the condition of the wage earner have steadily improve the 12-hour day be almost entirely unknown skilled labor be well compensate but there be unfortunately a multitude of worker who have not yet come to share in the general prosperity of the nation both the public authority and private enterprise should be solicitous to advance the welfare of this class the|federal|government have be seek to secure this end through a protective tariff through restrictive immigration through require safety device for the prevention of accident through the granting of workman 's compensation through civilian vocational rehabilitation and education through employment information bureaus and through such humanitarian relief as be provide in the maternity and infancy legislation be a satisfaction to report that a more general condition of contentment exist among wage earner and the country be more free from labor dispute than have be for year while restrictive immigration have be adopt in part for the benefit of the wage earner and in entirety for the benefit of the country ought not to cause a needless separation of family and dependent from natural source of support contrary to the dictate of humanity bituminous coal no progress appear to have be make within large area of the bituminous coal industry toward creation of voluntary machinery by which great assurance can be give to the public of peaceful adjustment of wage difficulty such as have be accomplish in the anthracite industry this bituminous industry be of primary necessity and bear a great responsibility to the nation for continuity of supply as the wage agreement in the unionized section of the industry expire on and as conflict may result which may imperil public interest and have for many|years often call for action of the executive in protection of the public again recommend the passage of such legislation as will assist the executive in deal with such emergency through a special temporary board of conciliation and mediation and through administrative agency for the purpose of distribution of coal and protection of the consumer of coal from profiteer at present the executive be not only without authority to act but be actually prohibit by law from make any expenditure to meet the emergency of a coal famine judiciary the federal court hold a high position in the administration of justice in the world while individual judicial officer have sometimes be subject to just criticism the court as a whole have maintain an exceedingly high standard the congress may well consider the question of supply fair salary and confer upon the|supreme|court the same rule make power on the law side of the district court that have always possess on the equity side a bill be also pende provide for retirement after a certain number of year of service although have not be consecutive which should have favorable consideration these faithful servant of the government be about the last that remain to be provide for in the postwar readjustment banking there have be pende in congress for nearly|three|years banking legislation to clarify the national bank act and reasonably to increase the power of the national bank believe that within the limitation of sound banking principle congress should now and for the future place the national bank upon a fair equality with competitor the state bank and trust that mean may be find so that the difference on branch banking legislation between the senate and the|house|of|representatives may be settle along sound line and the legislation promptly enact would be difficult to overestimate the service which the federal reserve system have already render to the country be necessary only to recall the chaotic condition of banking organization at the time the federal reserve system be put into operation the old system consist of a vast number of independent banking unit with scatter bank reserve which never could be mobilize in time of great need in spite of vast banking resource there be no coordination of reserve or any credit elasticity as a consequence a strain be feel even during crop move period and when be necessary to meet other seasonal and regularly recur need the federal reserve system be not a panacea for all economic or financial ill can not prevent depression in certain industry which be experience overexpansion of production or contraction of market business be to furnish adequate credit and currency facility this have succeed in do both during the war and in the more difficult period of deflation and readjustment which follow enable to look to the future with confidence and to make plan far ahead base on the belief that the federal reserve system will exercise a steadying influence on credit condition and thereby prevent tiny sudden or severe reaction from the period of prosperity which be now enjoy in order that these plan may go forward action should be take at the present session on the question of renew the bank ' charter and thereby insure a continuation of the policy and present usefulness of the federal reserve system federal regulation be in favor of reduce rather than expand government bureau which seek to regulate and control the business activity of the people everyone be aware that abuse exist and will exist so long as be limit by human imperfection unfortunately human nature can not be change by an act of the legislature when practically the sole remedy for many evil lie in the necessity of the people look out for and reform own abuse will find that be rely on a false security if the government assume to hold out the promise that be look out for and provide reform for this principle be preeminently applicable to the|national|government be too much assume that because an abuse exist be the business of to provide a remedy the presumption should be that be the business of local and state government such national action result in encroach upon the salutary independence of the states and by undertake to supersede natural authority fill the land with bureaus and department which be undertake to do what be impossible for to accomplish and bring whole system of government into disrespect and disfavor ought to maintain high standard ought to punish wrongdoing society have not only the privilege but the absolute duty of protect and individual but can not accomplish this end by adopt a wrong method permanent success lie in local rather than national action unless the locality rise to own requirement there be an almost irresistible impulse for the|national|government to intervene the states and the nation should both realize that such action be to be adopt only as a last resort the negro the social well being of country require constant effort for the amelioration of race prejudice and the extension to all element of equal opportunity and equal protection under the law which be guarantee by the constitution the|federal|government especially be charge with this obligation in behalf of the colored people of the nation not only remarkable progress devotion and loyalty but duty to under claim that be an enlightened people require to use all power to protect from the crime of lynching although violence of this kind have very much decrease while any of remain can not justify neglect to make every effort to eradicate by law the education of the colored race under government encouragement be proceed successfully and ought to have continue support an increase need exist for properly educate and train medical skill to be devote to the service of this race insular possession this government hold in sacred trusteeship island which have acquire in the east and west|indy in all of the people be more prosperous than at any previous time a system of good road education and general development be in progress the people be better govern than ever before and generally content in the|philippine|island maj . gen. leonard|wood have be governor general for five|years and have administer office with tact and ability greatly to the success of the filipino people these be a proud and sensitive race who be make such progress with cooperation that can view the result of this experiment with great satisfaction as be attempt to assist this race toward self government should look upon wish with great respect grant request immediately when be right yet maintain a frank firmness in refuse when be wrong shall measure progress in no small part by acceptance of the term of the organic law under which the island be govern and faithful observance of provision need exist for clarify the duty of the auditor and declare to be what everyone have suppose be have place own expenditure under the supervision of the comptroller general be not likely that the expenditure in the|philippine|island need less supervision than own the governor general be hamper in selection of subordinate by the necessity of secure a confirmation which have oftentime drive to the expediency of use army officer in work for which civilian expert would be much better fit means should be provide for this and such other purpose as may require out of the revenue which this government now turn back to the philippine treasury in order that these possession may stiffer no seeming neglect have recently send col . carmi a thompson to the island to make a survey in cooperation with the governor general to suggest what may be do to improve condition later may make a more extended report include recommendation the economic development of the island be very important ought not to be turn back to the people until be both politically fit for self government and economically independent large area be adaptable to the production of rubber no one contemplate any time in the future either under the present or a more independent form of government when should not assume some responsibility for defense for economic advantage for the employment of people and as a contribution to power of defense which could not be carry on without rubber believe this industry should be encourage be especially adapt to the filipino people who may cultivate individually on a small acreage could be carry on extensively by american capital in a way to furnish employment at good wage be oppose to the promotion of any policy that do not provide for absolute freedom on the part of the wage earner and do not think should undertake to give power for large holding of land in the island against the opposition of the people of the locality any development of the island must be solely with the first object of benefit the people of the island at an|early|day these possession should be take out from under all military control and administer entirely on the civil side of government national|defense policy of national defense be not of make war but of insure peace the land and sea force of america both in domestic and foreign implication be distinctly a peace force be an arm of the police power to guarantee order and the execution of the law at home and security to citizen abroad no self respect nation would neglect to provide an army and navy proportionate to population the extent of territory and the dignity of the place which occupy in the world when be consider that no navy in the world with exception approach ours and none surpass that regular|army of about|115,000 man be the equal of any other like number of troop that entire permanent and reserve land and sea force train and training consist of a personnel of about|610,000 and that annual appropriation be about|$680,000,000 a year expend under the direction of an exceedingly competent staff can not be say that country be neglect national defense be true that a cult of disparagement exist but that candid examination make by the congress through various committee have always reassure the country and demonstrate that be maintain the most adequate defensive force in these|present|years that have ever support in time of peace this general policy should be keep in effect here and there temporary change may be make in personnel to meet requirement in other direction attention should be give to submarine cruiser and air force particular point may need strengthen but as a whole military power be sufficient the weak place in the whole line be still stupendous war debt in any modern campaign the dollar be the shock troop with a depleted treasury in the rear no army can maintain in the field a country load with debt be a country devoid of the first line of defense economy be the handmaid of preparedness if wish to be able to defend to the full extent of power in the future shall discharge as soon as possible the financial burden of the last war otherwise would face a crisis with a part of capital resource already expend the amount and kind of military equipment be preeminently a question for the decision of the congress after give due consideration to the advice of military expert and the available public revenue nothing be more laudable than the cooperation of the agricultural and industrial resource of the country for the purpose of supply the need of national defense in time of peril the people employ in these interest volunteer in a most self sacrifice way often at the nominal charge of a|dollar a year but the army and navy be not support for the benefit of supply concern supply concern be support for the benefit of the army and navy the distribution of order on what be need from different concern for the purpose of keep up equipment and organization be perfectly justify but any attempt to prevail upon the government to purchase beyond need ought not to be tolerate be eminently fair that those who deal with the government should do so at a reasonable profit however public money be expend not that some one may profit by but in order to serve a public purpose while policy of national defense will proceed in order that may be independent and self sufficient be oppose to engage in any attempt at competitive armament no matter how much or how little some other country may feel constrain to provide can well afford to set the example not of be dictate to by other but of adopt own standard be strong enough to pursue that method which will be a most wholesome model for the rest of the world be eminently peaceful but be by no mean weak while submit difference with other not to the adjudication of force but of reason be not because be unable to defend right while be do good to eliminate all resort to war for the purpose of settle dispute can not but remember that the peace now enjoy have to be win by the sword and that if the right of country be to be defend can not rely for that purpose upon anyone but can not shirk the responsibility which be the first requisite of all government of preserve own integrity and maintain the right of own citizen be only in accordance with these principle that can establish any lasting foundation for an honorable and permanent peace be for these reason that country like any other country propose to provide with an army and navy support by a merchant marine yet these be not for competition with any other power for year have besought nation to disarm have recently express willingness at geneva to enter into treaty for the limitation of all type of warship accord to the ratio adopt at the|washington|conference this offer be still pende while be and shall continue to be armed be not as a menace but rather a common assurance of tranquility to all the peacelove people of the world for to do any less would be to disregard obligation evade responsibility and jeopardize national honor veterans this country not only because be bind by honor but because of the satisfaction derive from have always lavish bounty upon veteran for year a service pension have be bestow upon the|grand|army on reach a certain age like provision have be make for the survivor of the|spanish|war a liberal future compensation have be grant to all the veteran of the|world|war but be in the case of the disabled and the dependent that the government exhibit great solicitude this work be be well administer by the|veterans'|bureau the main unfinished feature be that of hospitalization this requirement be be rapidly meet various veteran body will present to recommendation which should have careful consideration at the last session increase annual expenditure for pension and relief on account of the veteran of war while approve of proper relief for all suffering do not favor any further extension of pension system at this time alien property still have in the possession of the government the alien property have always be the policy of america to hold that private enemy property should not be confiscate in time of war this principle have scrupulously observe as this property be security for the claim of citizen and government can not relinquish without adequate provision for reimbursement legislation for the return of this property accompany by suitable provision for the liquidation of the claim of citizen and treasury should be adopt if government release to foreigner the security which hold for americans must at the same time provide satisfactory safeguard for meet american claim prohibition the duly authorize public authority of this country have make prohibition the law of the land act under the|constitution|the|congress and the legislature of practically all the states have adopt legislation for enforcement some abuse have arise which require reform under the law the|national|government have entrust to the|treasury|department the especial duty of regulation and enforcement such supplementary legislation as require to meet exist condition should be carefully and speedily enact failure to support the constitution and observe the law ought not to be tolerate by public opinion especially those in public place who have take oath to support the constitution ought to be most scrupulous in observance officer of the|department|of|justice throughout the country should be vigilant in enforce the law but local authority which have always be mainly responsible for the enforcement of law in relation to intoxicate liquor ought not to seek evasion by attempt to shift the burden wholly upon the federal agency under the|constitution|the|states be jointly charge with the nation in provide for the enforcement of the prohibition amendment some people do not like the amendment some do not like other part of the constitution some do not like any of those who entertain such sentiment have a perfect right to seek through legal method for a change but for any of inhabitant to observe such part of the constitution as like while disregard other be a doctrine that would break down all protection of life and property and destroy the american system of order liberty foreign relation the foreign policy of this government be well know be of peace base on that mutual respect that arise from mutual regard for international right arid the discharge of international obligation be purpose to promote understanding and good will between and all other people the american people be altogether lack in an appreciation of the tremendous good fortune that surround international position have no traditional enemy be not embarrassed over any disputed territory have no possession that be covet by other have none that be covet by border be unfortified fear no one no one fear all the world know that the whole extent of influence be against war and in favor of peace against the use of force and in favor of negotiation arbitration and adjudication as a method of adjust international difference look with disfavor upon all aggressive warfare be strong enough so that no one can charge with weakness if be slow to anger place be sufficiently establish so that need not be sensitive over trifle resource be large enough so that can afford to be generous at the same time be a nation among nation and recognize a responsibility not only to but in the interest of a stable and enlightened civilization to protect and defend the international right of government and citizen be because of historical detachment and the generation of comparative indifference toward by other nation that public be incline to consider altogether too seriously the report that be criticize abroad never have a large foreign trade than at the present time good office be never more seek and the necessity for assistance and cooperation be never more universally declare in any time of peace know that the sentiment which entertain toward all other nation be those of the most sincere friendship and good will and of all unbounded desire to help which be perfectly willing to have judge by fruit in effort to adjust international obligation have meet with a response which when everything be consider believe history will record as a most remarkable and gratify demonstration of the sanctity with which civilized nation undertake to discharge mutual obligation debt settlement have be negotiate with practically all of those who owe and all finally adjust but which be in process of ratification when consider the real sacrifice that will be necessary on the part of other nation consider all circumstance to meet agree payment ought to hold in increase admiration and respect be true that have extend to very generous treatment but be also true that have agree to repay all that loan to and some interest a special conference on the chinese custom tariff provide for by the treaty between the power relate to the chinese custom tariff sign

on may|18 and work have be proceed almost continuously since that date would be premature to attempt to form a judgment as to the progress that have be make the commission have have before a comprehensive list of question touch upon all aspect of the question of the limitation of armament in the commission 's discussion many difference of opinion have develop however be hopeful that at least some measure of agreement will be reach as the discussion continue the american representation on the commission have consistently try to be helpful and have keep before the practical objective to which the commission be work namely actual agreement for the limitation of armament representative will continue work in that direction of the most encouraging feature of the commission 's work thus far have be the agreement in principle among the naval expert of a majority of the power party to the washington treaty limit naval armament upon method and standard for the comparison and further limitation of naval armament be needless to say that at the proper time shall be prepare to proceed along practical line to the conclusion of agreement carry further the work begin at the|washington|conference in department report many important subject which be impossible even to mention in the short space of an annual message will find fully discuss in the departmental report a failure to include here be not to be take as indicate any lack of interest but only a disinclination to state inadequately what have be much well do in other document the capital city be embark on an ambitious building program for the city of washington the|memorial|bridge be under way with all that hold for use and beauty new building be soon contemplate this program should represent the good that exist in the art and science of architecture into these structure which must be consider as of a permanent nature ought to go the aspiration of the nation ideal express in form of beauty if country wish to compete with other let not be in the support of armament but in the making of a beautiful capital city let express the soul of america whenever an american be at the seat of government however travel and culture may be ought to find a city of stately proportion symmetrically lay out and adorn with the good that there be in architecture which would arouse imagination and stir patriotic pride in the|coming|years washington should be not only the art center of own country but the art center of the world around should center all that be good in science in learning in letter and in art these be the result that justify the creation of those national resource with which have be favor american ideals america be not and must not be a country without ideal be useless if be only visionary be only valuable if be practical a nation can not dwell constantly on the mountain top have to be replenish and sustain through the ceaseless toil of the less inspiring valley but face ought always to be turn upward vision ought always to be fix on high need ideal that can be follow in daily life that can be translate into term of the home can not expect to be relieve from toil but do expect to divest of degrade condition work be honorable be entitle to an honorable recompense must strive mightily but have strive there be a defect in political and social system if be not in general reward with success to relieve the land of the burden that come from the war to release to the individual more of the fruit of own industry to increase earning capacity and decrease hour of labor to enlarge the circle of vision through good road and well transportation to lace before the opportunity for education both in science and in art to leave free to receive the inspiration of religion all these be ideal which deliver from the servitude of the body and exalt to the service of the soul through this emancipation from the thing that be material broaden dominion over the thing that be spiritual transcript fellow countrymen meet to celebrate the birthday of america that come of a new life always excite interest although know in the case of the individual that have be an infinite repetition reach back beyond vision that only make more wonderful but how interest and wonder increase when behold the miracle of the birth of a new nation be to pay tribute of reverence and respect to those who participate in such a mighty event that annually observe the|4th|day|of|july whatever may have be the impression create by the news which go out from this city on that summer day in there can be no doubt as to the estimate which be now place upon at the|end|of|150|year the corner of the earth unite in come to philadelphia as to a holy shrine in grateful acknowledgment of a service so great which a few inspire man here render to humanity that be still the preeminent support of free government throughout the world although a|century|and|a|half measure in comparison with the length of human experience be but a short time yet measure in the life of government and nation rank as a very respectable period certainly enough time have elapse to demonstrate with a great real of thoroughness the value of institution and dependability as rule for the regulation of human conduct and the advancement of civilization have be in existence long enough to become very well seasoned have meet and meet successfully the test of experience be not so much then for the purpose of undertaking to proclaim new theory and principle that this annual celebration be maintain but rather to reaffirm and reestablish those old theory and principle which time and the unerring logic of event have demonstrate to be sound amid all the clash of conflict interest amid all the welter of partisan politic every american can turn for solace and consolation to the|declaration|of|independence|and|the|constitution|of the|united|state with the assurance and confidence that those great charter of freedom and justice remain firm and unshaken whatever peril appear whatever danger threaten the nation remain secure in the knowledge that the ultimate application of the law of the land will provide an adequate defense and protection be little wonder that people at home and abroad consider independence|hall as hallowed ground and revere the|liberty|bell as a sacred relic that pile of brick and mortar that mass of metal may appear to the uninstructed as only the outgrown meeting place and the shatter bell of a former time useless now because of more modern convenience but to those who know have become consecrate by the use which man have make of have long be identify with a great cause be the framework of a spiritual event the world look upon because of association of as look upon because of what take place there nineteen|hundred|years|ago through use for a righteous purpose have become sanctify be not here necessary to examine in detail the cause which lead to the|american|revolution in immediate occasion be largely economic the colonist object to the navigation law which interfere with trade deny the power of parliament to impose taxis which be oblige to pay and therefore resist the royal governor and the royal force which be send to secure obedience to these law but the conviction be inescapable that a new civilization have come a new spirit have arise on this side of the atlantic more advanced and more developed in regard for the right of the individual than that which characterize the old world life in a new and open country have aspiration which could not be realize in any subordinate position a separate establishment be ultimately inevitable have be decree by the very law of human nature man everywhere have an unconquerable desire to be the master of own destiny be oblige to conclude that the|declaration|of|independence represent the movement of a people be not of course a movement from the top revolution do not come from that direction be not without the support of many of the most respectable people in the colonies who be entitle to all the consideration that be give to breeding education and possession have the support of another element of great significance and importance to which shall later refer but the preponderance of all those who occupy a position which take on the aspect of aristocracy do not approve of the revolution and hold toward an attitude either of neutrality or open hostility be in no sense a rising of the oppress and downtrodden bring no scum to the surface for the reason that colonial society have develop no scum the great body of the people be accustomed to privation but be free from depravity if have poverty be not of the hopeless kind that afflict great city but the inspiring kind that mark the spirit of the pioneer the|american|revolution represent the informed and mature conviction of a great mass of independent liberty loving god fear people who know right and possess the courage to dare to maintain the|continental|congress be not only compose of great man but represent a great people while member do not fail to exercise a remarkable leadership be equally observant of representative capacity be industrious in encourage constituent to instruct to support independence but until such instruction be give be incline to withhold action while north|carolina have the honor of first authorize delegate to concur with other colonies in declare independence be quickly follow by south|carolina and georgia which also give general instruction broad enough to include such action but the first instruction which unconditionally direct delegate to declare for independence come from the great commonwealth|of|virginia these be immediately follow by rhode|island and massachusetts while the other colonies with the exception of new|york soon adopt a like course this obedience of the delegate to the wish of constituent which in some case cause to modify previous position be a matter of great significance reveal an orderly process of government in the first place but more than that demonstrate that the|declaration|of|independence be the result of the seasoned and deliberate thought of the dominant portion of the people of the colonies adopt after long discussion and as the result of the duly authorize expression of the preponderance of public opinion do not partake of dark intrigue or hidden conspiracy be well advise have about nothing of the lawless and disordered nature of a riotous insurrection be maintain on a plane which rise above the ordinary conception of rebellion be in no sense a radical movement but take on the dignity of a resistance to illegal usurpation be conservative and represent the action of the colonist to maintain constitutional right which from time immemorial have be guarantee to under the law of the land when come to examine the action of the|continental|congress in adopt the|declaration|of|independence in the light of what be set out in that great document and in the light of succeed event can not escape the conclusion that have a much broad and deep significance than a mere secession if territory and the establishment of a new nation event of that nature have be take place since the dawn of history empire after another have arise only to crumble away as constituent part separate from each other and set up independent government of own such action long ago become commonplace have occur too often to hold the attention of the world and command the administration and reverence of humanity there be something beyond the establishment of a new nation great as that event would be in the|declaration|of|independence which have ever since cause to be regard as of the great charter that not only be to liberate america but be everywhere to ennoble humanity be not because be propose to establish a new nation but because be propose to establish a nation on new principle that july|4,|1776 have come to be regard as of in history great idea do not burst upon the world unannounce be reach by a gradual development over a length of time usually proportionate to importance this be especially true of the principle lay down in the|declaration|of|independence very definite proposition be set out in preamble regard the nature of mankind and therefore of government these be the doctrine that all man be create equal that be endow with certain inalienable right and that therefore the source of the just power of government must be derive from the consent of the govern if no one be to be account as bear into a superior station if there be to be no rule class and if all possess right which can neither be barter away nor take from by any earthly power follow as a matter of course that the practical authority of the government have to rest on the consent of the govern while these principle be not altogether new in political action and be very far from new in political speculation have never be assemble before and declare in such a combination but remarkable as this may be be not the chief distinction of the importance of political speculation be not to be underestimate as shall presently disclose until the idea be develop and the plan make there can be no action be the fact that declaration of independence contain these immortal truth be the political action of a duly authorize and constitute representative public body in sovereign capacity support by the force of general opinion and by the army of washington already in the field which make the most important civil document in the world be not only the principle declare but the fact that therewith a new nation be bear which be to be found upon those principle and which from that time forth in development have actually maintain those principle that make this pronouncement an incomparable event in the history of government be an assertion that a people have arise determine to make every necessary sacrifice for the support of these truth and by practical application bring the|war|of|independence to a successful conclusion and adopt the constitution of the|united|state with all that have mean to civilization the idea that the people have a right to choose own ruler be not new in political history be the foundation of every popular attempt to depose an undesirable king this right be set out with a good deal of detail by the dutch when as|early|as|july|26,|1581 declare independence of philip|of|spain in long struggle with the stuarts the british people assert the same principle which finally culminate in the|bill|of|rights depose the last of that house and place william and mary on the throne in each of these case sovereignty through divine right be displace by sovereignty through the consent of the people run through the same document though express in different term be the clear inference of inalienable right but should search these charter in vain for an assertion of the doctrine of equality this principle have not before appear as an official political declaration of any nation be profoundly revolutionary be of the corner stone of american institution but if these truth to which the declaration refer have not before be adopt in combine entirely by national authority be a fact that have be long ponder and often express in political speculation be generally assume that french thought have some effect upon public mind during this may have be true but the principle of declaration have be under discussion in the colonies for nearly generation before the advent of the french political philosophy that characterize the middle of the|eighteenth|century in fact come from an early date a very positive echo of what the dutch have do in and what the english be prepare to do appear in the assertion of the rev. thomas|hooker of connecticut as|early|as|1638 when say in a sermon before the|general|court the foundation of authority be lay in the free consent of the people the choice of public magistrate belong to the people by god 's own allowance this doctrine find wide acceptance among the nonconformist clergy who later make up the|congregational|church the great apostle of this movement be the rev. john|wise of massachusetts be of the leader of the revolt against the royal governor andross in for which suffer imprisonment be a liberal in ecclesiastical controversy appear to have be familiar with the writing of the political scientist samuel|pufendorf who be bear in saxony in wise publish a treatise entitle the|church 's quarrel espouse in which be amplify in another publication in in deal with the principle of civil government work be reprint in and have be declare to have be nothing less than a textbook of liberty for revolutionary father while the write word be the foundation be apparent that the spoken word be the vehicle for convince the people this come with great force and wide range from the successor of hooker and wise be carry on with a missionary spirit which do not fail to reach the scotch irish of north|carolina show influence by significantly make that colony the first to give instruction to delegate look to independence this preaching reach the neighborhood of thomas|jefferson who acknowledge that good idea of democracy have be secure at church meeting that these idea be prevalent in virginia be further reveal by which be prepare by george|mason and present to the general assembly on may|27,|1776 this document assert popular sovereignty and inherent natural right but confine the doctrine of equality to the assertion that all man be create equally free and independent can scarcely be imagine that jefferson be unacquainted with what have be do in own commonwealth|of|virginia when take up the task of draft the|declaration|of|independence but these thought can very largely be trace back to what john|wise be write in say every man must be acknowledge equal to very man again the end of all good government be to cultivate humanity and promote the happiness of all and the good of every man in all right life liberty estate honor and so forth and again for as have a power every man in natural state so upon combination can and do bequeath this power to other and settle accord as united discretion shall determine and still again democracy be christ 's government in church and state here be the doctrine of equality popular sovereignty and the substance of the theory of inalienable right clearly assert by wise at the opening of the|eighteenth|century just as have the principle of the consent of the govern state by hooker as early as when take all these circumstance into consideration be but natural that the first paragraph of the|declaration|of|independence should open with a reference to nature 's god and should close in the final paragraph with an appeal to the supreme judge of the world and an assertion of a firm reliance on divine|providence come from these source have as do this background be no wonder that samuel|adams could say the people seem to recognize this resolution as though be a decree promulgate from heaven no one can examine this record and escape the conclusion that in the great outline of principle the declaration be the result of the religious teaching of the precede period the profound philosophy which jonathan|edwards apply to theology the popular preaching of george|whitefield have arouse the thought and stir the people of the colonies in preparation for this great event no doubt the speculation which have be go on in england and especially on the continent lend influence to the general sentiment of the time of course the world be always influence by all the experience and all the thought of the past but when come to a contemplation of the immediate conception of the principle of human relationship which go into the|declaration|of|independence be not require to extend search beyond own shore be find in the text the sermon and the writing of the early colonial clergy who be earnestly undertake to instruct congregation in the great mystery of how to live preach equality because believe in the fatherhood of god and the brotherhood of man justify freedom by the text that be all create in the divine image all partaker of the divine spirit place every man on a plane where acknowledge no superior where no one possess any right to rule over must inevitably choose own ruler through a system of self government this be theory of democracy in those|day such doctrine would scarcely have be permit to flourish and spread in any other country this be the purpose which the father cherish in order that may have freedom to express these thought and opportunity to put into action whole congregation with pastor have migrate to the colonies these great truth be in the air that people breathe whatever else may say of the|declaration|of|independence be profoundly american if this apprehension of the fact be correct and the documentary evidence would appear to verify then certain conclusion be bind to follow a spring will cease to flow if source be dry up a tree will wither if root be destroy in main feature the|declaration|of|independence be a great spiritual document be a declaration not of material but of spiritual conception equality liberty popular sovereignty the right of man these be not element which can see and touch be ideal have source and root in the religious conviction belong to the unseen world unless the faith of the american people in these religious conviction be to endure the principle of declaration will perish can not continue to enjoy the result if neglect and abandon the cause be too prone to overlook another conclusion government do not make ideal but ideal make government this be both historically and logically true of course the government can help to sustain ideal and can create institution through which can be the better observed but source by very nature be in the people the people have to bear own responsibility there be no method by which that burden can be shift to the government be not the enactment but the observance of law that create the character of a nation about the declaration there be a finality that be exceedingly restful be often assert that the world have make a great deal of progress since that have have new thought and new experience which have give a great advance over the people of that|day and that may therefore very well discard conclusion for something more modern but that reasoning can not be apply to this great charter if all man be create equal that be final if be endow with inalienable right that be final if government derive just power from the consent of the govern that be final no advance no progress can be make beyond these proposition if anyone wish to deny truth or soundness the only direction in which can proceed historically be not forward but backward toward the time when there be no equality no right of the individual no rule of the people those who wish to proceed in that direction can not lay claim to progress be reactionary idea be not more modern but more ancient than those of the revolutionary father in the development of institution america can fairly claim that have remain true to the principle which be declare in all the essential have achieve an equality which be never possess by any other people even in the less important matter of material possession have secure a wide and wide distribution of wealth the right of the individual be hold sacred and protect by constitutional guaranty which even the government be bind not to violate if there be any thing among that be establish beyond question be self government the right of the people to rule if there be any failure in respect to any of these principle be because there be a failure on the part of individual to observe hold that the duly authorize expression of the will of the people have a divine sanction but even in that come back to the theory of john|wise that democracy|is|christ 's government the ultimate sanction of law rest on the righteous authority of the almighty on an occasion like this great temptation exist to present evidence of the practical success of form of democratic republic at home and the ever broaden acceptance be secure abroad although these thing be well know frequent consideration be an encouragement and an inspiration but be not result and effect so much as source and cause that believe be even more necessary constantly to contemplate be a government of the people represent will officer may sometimes go astray but that be not a reason for criticize the principle of institution the real heart of the american|government depend upon the heart of the people be from that source that must look for all genuine reform be to that cause that must ascribe all result be in the contemplation of these truth that the father make declaration and adopt constitution be to establish a free government which must not be permit to degenerate into the unrestrained authority of a mere majority or the unbridled weight of a mere influential few undertake to balance these interest against each other and provide the separate independent branch the executive the legislative and the judicial department of the government with check against each other in order that neither one may encroach upon the other these be guarantee of liberty as a result of these method enterprise have be duly protect from confiscation the people have be free from oppression and there have be an ever broaden and deepening of the humanity of life under a system of popular government there will always be those who will seek for political preferment by clamor for reform while there be very little of this which be not sincere there be a large portion that be not well informed in opinion very little of just criticism can attach to the theory and principle of institution there be far more danger of harm than there be hope of good in any radical change do need a well understanding and comprehension of and a well knowledge of the foundation of government in general forefather come to certain conclusion and decide upon certain course of action which have be a great blessing to the world before can understand conclusion must go back and review the course which follow must think the thought which think intellectual life center around the meetinghouse be intent upon religious worship while there be always among man of deep learning and later those who have comparatively large possession the mind of the people be not so much engross in how much know or how much have as in how be go to live while scantily provide with other literature there be a wide acquaintance with the scripture over a period as great as that which measure the existence of independence be subject to this discipline not only in religious life and educational training but also in political thought be a people who come under the influence of a great spiritual development and acquire a great moral power no other theory be adequate to explain or comprehend the|declaration|of|independence be the product of the spiritual insight of the people live in an age of science and of abound accumulation of material thing these do not create declaration declaration create the thing of the spirit come first unless cling to that all material prosperity overwhelm though may appear will turn to a barren scepter in grasp if be to maintain the great heritage which have be bequeath to must be like minded as the father who create must not sink into a pagan materialism must cultivate the reverence which have for the thing that be holy must follow the spiritual and moral leadership which show must keep replenish that may glow with a more compelling flame the altar fire before which worship transcript member of the congress in meet the constitutional requirement of inform the congress upon the state of the union be exceedingly gratify to report that the general condition be of progress and prosperity here and there be comparatively small and apparently temporary difficulty need adjustment and improve administrative method such as be always to be expect but i ii the fundamental of government and business the result demonstrate that be go in the right direction the country do not appear to require radical departure from the policy already adopt so much as need a further extension of these policy and the improvement of detail the age of perfection be still in the somewhat distant future but be more in danger of be retard by mistaken government activity than be from lack of legislation be by far the most likely to accomplish permanent good if proceed with moderation in country the people be sovereign and independent and must accept the result responsibility be duty to support and support the government that be the business of the nation whatever the charity of the nation may require the function which the congress be to discharge be not those of local government but of national|government the great solicitude should be exercise to prevent any encroachment upon the right of the states or various political subdivision local self government be of most precious possession be the great contributing factor to the stability strength liberty and progress of the nation ought not to be in ring by assault or undermine by purchase ought not to abdicate power through weakness or resign authority through favor do not at all follow that because abuse exist be the concern of the|federal|government to attempt the r reform society be in much more danger from encumber the|national|government beyond wisdom to comprehend or ability to administer than from leave the local community to bear own burden and remedy own evil local habit and custom be so strong variety of race and creed be so great the federal authority be so tenuous that the area within which can function successfully be very limited the wise policy be to leave the locality so far as can possess of own source of revenue and charge with own obligation government economy be a fundamental principle of country that the people be sovereign while recognize the undeniable authority of the state have establish as instrument a government of limited power hold inviolate in own hand the jurisdiction over own freedom and the ownership of own property neither of these can be impair except by due process of law the wealth of country be not public wealth but private wealth do not belong to the government belong to the people the government have no justification in take private property except for a public purpose be always necessary to keep these principle in mind in the laying of taxis and in the making of appropriation no right exist to levy on a dollar or to order the expenditure of a dollar of the money of the people except for a necessary public purpose duly authorize by the constitution the power over the purse be the power over liberty that be the legal limitation within which the congress can act how will proceed within this limitation be always a question of policy when the country be prosperous and free from debt when the rate of taxation be low opportunity exist for assume new burden and undertake new enterprise such a condition now prevail only to a limited extent all proposal for assume new obligation ought to be postpone unless be reproductive capital investment or be such as be absolutely necessary at this time still have an enormous debt of over|$20,000,000,000 on which the interest and sinking fund requirement be appropriation for the|pension|office and the|veterans'|bureau be and navy departments call for other requirement exclusive of the|post|office| which be virtually self sustain bring the appropriation for the|current|year up to almost c3,100,060,000 this show an expenditure of close|to|$30 for every inhabitant of country for the average family of mean a tax directly or indirectly pay of about|$150 for national purpose alone the local tax add much more these enormous expenditure ought not to be increase but through every possible effort ought to be reduce only|one of these great item can be ultimately extinguish that be the item of war debt already this have be reduce to about|$6,000,000,000 which mean an annual saving in interest of close|to|$250,000,000 the present interest charge be about|$820,000,000 yearly would seem to be obvious that the sooner this debt can be retire the more the taxpayer will save in interest and the easy will be to secure fund with which to prosecute need running expense construction and improvement this item of for interest be a heavy charge on all the people of the country and seem to that may well consider whether be not greatly worth while to dispense with as early as possible by retire the principal debt which be require to serve have always be policy to retire debt that of the|revolutionary|war|period notwithstanding the addition make in be pay by and the|civil|war debt within of the amount already pay over be a reduction in cash balance that source be exhaust over and third billion of dollar be derive from excess receipt tax reduction eliminate that the sale of surplus war material have be another element of income that be practically finish with these eliminate the reduction of the debt have be each year not an excessive sum on so large a debt proposal have be make to extend the payment over a period of if be pay at the|end|of|20|year the cost to the taxpayer be the principal and the interest be % per cent a total of if the same sum be pay at the|end|of|62|year the cost be or almost double here be another consideration compare with purchasing power in the dollar borrow represent but 52|cent as the value of dollar increase due to the fall price of commodity the burden of debt increase have now rise to the taxpayer will be require to produce nearly twice the amount of commodity to pay debt if the dollar return to the value the more pay while price be high the easy will be deflation of government after a war period be slow than deflation of business where curtailment be either prompt and effective or disaster follow there be room for further economy in the cost of the|federal|government but a co n of current expenditure with pre - war expenditure be not able to the efficiency with which government business be now be do the expenditure of the last pre - war year be and in over or nearly|five time as great if subtract expenditure for debt retirement and interest veteran ' relief increase of pension and other special outlay consist of refund trust investment and like charge find that the general expenditure of the government in be slightly more than twice as large as in as price in be approximately|40|per|cent high than in the cost of the same government must also have increase but the government be not the same be more expensive to collect the much great revenue necessary and to administer great debt have give enlarge and improve service to agriculture and commerce above all america have grow in population and wealth government expenditure must always share in this growth take into account the factor have mention believe that present federal expense be not far out of line with pre - war expense have nearly accomplish the deflation this do not mean that further economy will not come as reduce debt interest charge decline there be many detail yet to correct the real improvement however must come not from additional curtailment of expense but by a more intelligent more order spending economy must be constructive while should avoid as far as possible increase in permanent current expenditure oftentime a capital outlay like internal improvement will result in actual constructive saving that be economy in good sense be an avoidance of waste that there may be the mean for an outlay to day which will bring large return to morrow should constantly engage in scientific study of future requirement and adopt an orderly program for service economy be the method by which prepare to day to afford the improvement of to morrow a mere policy of economy without any instrumentality for put into operation would be very ineffective the congress have wisely set up to investigate and inform the president what recommendation ought to make for current appropriation this give a centralized authority where a general and comprehensive understanding can be reach of the source of income and the most equitable distribution of expenditure how well have work be indicate by the fact that the departmental estimate for before the budget law be while the budget estimate for be this latter figure show the reduction in departmental estimate for the|coming|year make possible by the operation of the budget system that the congress have provide but be evidently not enough to have care in make appropriation without any restraint upon expenditure the congress have provide that check by establish the office of comptroller|general the purpose of maintain the budget director and the comptroller general be to secure economy and efficiency in government expenditure no well method have be devise for the accomplishment of that end these office can not be administer in all the various detail without make some error both of fact and of judgment but the important consideration remain that these be the instrumentality of the congress and that no other plan have ever be adopt which be so successful in promote economy and efficiency the congress have absolute authority over the appropriation and be free to exercise judgment as the evidence may warrant in increase or decrease budget recommendation but ought to resist every effort to weaken or break down this most beneficial system of supervise appropriation and expenditure without all the claim of economy would be a mere pretense taxation the purpose of reduce expenditure be to secure a reduction in taxis that purpose be about to be realize with commendable promptness the|ways|and|means|committee of the house have undertake in advance of the meeting of the congress to frame a revenue act as the bill have proceed through the committee have take on a nonpartisan character and both republicans and democrats have join in a measure which embody many sound principle of tax reform the bill will correct substantially the economic defect inject into the revenue act of as well as many which have remain as war time legacy in present form should provide sufficient revenue for the government the excessive surtax have be reduce estate tax rate arv restore to more reasonable figure with every prospect of withdraw from the field when the states have have the opportunity to correct the abuse in own inheritance tax law the gift tax and publicity section be to be repeal many miscellaneous taxis be lower or abandon and the|board|of|tax|appeals and the administrative feature of the law be improve and strengthen approve of the bill in principle in so far as income tax exemption be concern seem to the committee have go as far as be safe to go and somewhat further than should have go any further extension along these line would in opinion impair tile integrity of income tax system be advise that the bill will be through the house by christmas for this prompt action the country call thank the good sense of the|ways|and|means|committee in frame an economic measure upon economic consideration if this attitude continue to be reflect through the congress the taxpayer will have relief by the time march|15th installment of income taxis be due nonpartisan effort mean certain quick action determination of a revenue law definitely promptly and solely as a revenue law be of the great gift a legislature can bestow upon constituent commend the example of file ways|and|means|committee if follow will place sound legislation upon the book in time to give the taxpayer the full benefit of tax reduction next|year this mean that the bill should reach prior to march|15 all these economic result be be seek not to benefit the rich but to benefit the people be for the purpose of encourage industry in order that employment may be plentiful seek to make business good in order that wage may be good encourage prosperity in order that poverty may be banish from the home seek to lay the foundation which through increase production may give the people a more bountiful supply of the necessary of life afford more leisure for the improvement of the mind the appreciation of the art of music and literature sculpture and painting and the beneficial enjoyment of outdoor sport and recreation enlarge the resource which minister to charity and by au these mean attempt to strengthen the spiritual life of the nation foreign relation the policy of foreign relation cast aside any suggestion of force rest solely on the foundation of peace good will and good work have seek in intercourse with other nation well understanding through conference and exchange of view befit being endow with reason the result have be the gradual elimination of dispute the settlement of controversy and the establishment of a firm friendship between america and the rest of the world that have ever exist tit any previous time the example of this attitude have not be without influence upon other country act upon an adjustment be make of the difficult problem of reparation this be the second step toward peace in europe pave the way for the agreement which be draw tip at the|locarno|conference when ratified these will represent the third step toward peace while do not of provide an economic rehabilitation which be necessary for the progress of europe by strengthen the guarantee of peace diminish the need for great armament if the energy which now go into military effort be transfer to productive endeavor will greatly assist economic progress the locarno agreement be make by the european country directly interested without any formal intervention of america although on july|3|1 publicly advocate such agreement in an address make in massachusetts have consistently refrain from intervene except when help have be seek and have feel could be effectively give as in the settlement of reparation and the|london|conference these recent locarno agreement represent the success of this policy which have be insist ought to be adopt of have european country settle own political problem without involve this country this beginning seem to demonstrate that this policy be sound be exceedingly gratify to observe this progress both in method and in result promise so much that be beneficial to the world when these agreement be finally adopt will provide guarantee of peace that make the present prime reliance upon force in some part of europe very much less necessary the natural corollary to these treaty should be further international contract for the limitation of armament this work be successfully begin at the|washington|conference nothing be do at that time concern land force because of european objection stand army have be reduce to around|118,000 about the necessary police force for people be not propose to increase nor be supposable that any foreign country look with the slight misapprehension upon land force do not menace anybody be rather a protection to everybody the question of disarm upon land be so peculiarly european in practical aspect that country would look with particular gratitude upon any action which those country may take to reduce own military force this be in accordance with policy of not intervene unless the european power be unable to agree and make request for assistance whenever be able to agree of own accord be especially gratify to and such agreement may be sure of sympathetic support seem clear that be the reduction of army rather than of navy that be of the first importance to the world at the present time shall look with great satisfaction upon that effort and give approbation and encouragement if that can be settle may more easily consider further reduction and limitation of naval armament for that purpose country have constantly through executive and through repeat act of congress indicate willingness to call such a conference under congressional sanction would seem to be wise to participate in any conference of the great power for naval limitation of armament propose upon such condition that would hold a fair promise of be effective the general policy of country be for disarmament and ought not to hesitate to adopt any practical plan that may reasonably be expect to succeed but would not care to attend a conference which from location or constituency would in all probability prove futile in the further pursuit of strengthen the bond of peace and good will have join with other nation in an international conference hold at geneva and sign an agreement which will be lay before the senate for ratification provide suitable measure for control and for publicity in international trade in arm ammunition and implement of war and also execute a protocol provide for a prohibition of the use of poison gas in war in accordance with the principle of article|5|of|the treaty relate thereto sign at tile washington|conference be support the pan|american effort that be be make toward the codification of international law and look with sympathy oil the investigation conduct under philanthropic auspex of the proposal to agreement outlaw war in accordance with promise make at the|washington|conference have urge the calling of and be now represent at the|chinese|customs|conference and on where will be policy so far as possible to meet the aspiration of china in all way consistent with the interest of the country involve court of international justice pende before the senate for nearly|three|years be the proposal to adhere to the protocol establish the|permanent|court|of|international|justice a well establish line of precedent mark america 's effort to effect the establishment of court of this nature take a leading part in lay the foundation on which rest in the establishment of the|hague|court|of|arbitration be that tribunal which nominate the judge who be elect by tile council|and|assembly|of|the|league|of|nation the proposal submit to the senate be make dependent upon condition the first of which be that by support the court do not assume any obligation under the league that may participate upon an equality with other states in the election of judge third that the congress shall determine what part of the expense shall bear fourth that the statute create tile court shall not be amend without out consent and to these have propose an additional condition to the effect that be not to be bind by advisory opinion render without consent the court appear to be independent of the league be true tile judge be elect by tile assembly|and|council but be nominate by the|court|of|arbitration which assist to create and of which be a part the court be create by statute so call which be really a treaty make among some different country that may properly be call a constitution of the court this statute provide a method by which the judge be choose so that when the|court|of|arbitration nominate and elect be not act as instrument of the|court|of|arbitration or instrument of the league but as instrument of the statute this will be even more apparent if representative sit with the member of the council and assembly in elect the judge be true be pay through the league though not by the league but by the country which be member of the league and by country if accept the protocol the judge be pay by the league only in the same sense that could be say united|stat judge be pay by the congress the court derive all authority from the statute and be so completely independent of the league that could go on function if the league be disband at least until the term of the judge expire the most careful provision be make in the statute as to the qualification of judge those who make the nomination be recommend to consult with high court of justice law school and academy the judge must be person of high moral character qualified to hold the high judicial office in that country or be jurisconsult of recognize competence in international law must be assume that these requirement will continue to be carefully meet and with america join the country already concern be difficult to comprehend how human ingenuity could better provide for the establishment of a court which would maintain independence have to be recognize that independence be to a considerable extent a matter of ability character and personality some effort be make in the early beginning to interfere with the independence of supreme|court do not succeed because of the quality of the man who make up that tribunal do not seem that the authority to give advisory opinion interfere with the independence of the court advisory opinion in and of be not harmful but may be use in such a way as to be very beneficial because undertake to prevent injury rather than merely afford a remedy after the injury have be do as a principle that only imply that the court shall function when proper application be make to decide the question involve upon issue submit for an advisory opinion do not differ materially from decide the question involve upon issue submit by contend party up to the present time the court have give an advisory opinion when judge have jurisdiction and refuse to give when judge do not have jurisdiction nothing in the work of the court have yet be an indication that this be an impairment of independence or that practice differ materially from the giving of like opinion under the authority of the constitution of several of states no provision of the statute seem to to give this court any authority to be a political rather than a judicial court have bring case in this country before court which when have be adjudge to be political have be thereby dismiss be not improbable that political question will be submit to this court but again up to the present time the court have refuse to pass on political question and support would undoubtedly have a tendency to strengthen in that refusal be not propose to subject to any compulsory jurisdiction if support the court can never be oblige to submit any case which involve interest for decision appearance before would always be voluntary for the purpose of present a case which have agree may be present there be no more danger that other may bring case before the court involve interest which do not wish to have bring after have adhere and probably not so much than there would be of bring such case if do not adhere think that would have the same legal or moral right to disregard such a finding in the case that would in the other if be go to support any court will not be that have set tip alone or which reflect only ideal other nation have custom and institution thought and method of life if a court be go to be international composition will have to yield to what be good in all these various element neither will be possible to support a court which be exactly perfect or under which assume absolutely no obligation if be seek that opportunity may as well declare that be oppose to support any court if any agreement be make will be because undertake to set up a tribunal which can do some of the thing that other nation wish to have do shall not find bear a disproportionate share of the world 's burden by adherence and may as well remember that there be absolutely no escape for country from bear share of the world 's burden in any case shall do far well service to and to other if admit this and discharge duty voluntarily than if deny and be force to meet the same obligation unwillingly be difficult to imagine anything that would be more helpful to the world than stability tranquility and international justice may say that be contribute to these factor independently but other less fortunately locate do not and can not make a like contribution except through mutual cooperation the old balance of power mutual alliance and great military force be not bring bout by any mutual dislike for independence but result from the domination of circumstance ultimately be force on like all other engage in the war whatever say as a matter of fact join an alliance become a military power impair independence have more at stake than any else in avoid a repetition of that calamity war do not spring into existence arise from small incident and trifling irritation which can be adjust by an international court can contribute greatly to the advancement of ideal by join with other nation in maintain such a tribunal foreign debt gradually settlement have be make which provide for the liquidation of debt due to government from foreign government those make with great|britain finland hungary lithuania and poland have already be approve by the congress since the adjournment further agreement have be enter into with belgium czechoslovakia latvia estonia italy and rumania these nation which have already make settlement represent of the original principal of the loan the principal sum without interest still pende be the debt of france of greece yugoslavia liberia russia which those at present in control have undertake openly to repudiate nicaragua which be be pay currently and austria on which by act of congress a moratorium of have be grant the only remain sum be due from armenia which have now cease to exist as an independent nation in accordance with the settlement make the amount of principal and interest which be to be pay to the|united|state under these agreement aggregate be obvious that the remain settlement which will undoubtedly be make will bring this sum up to an amount which will more than equal the principal due on present national debt while these settlement be very large in the aggregate have be feel that the term grant be in all case very generous impose no undue burden and be mutually beneficial in the observance of international faith and the improvement of international credit every reasonable effort will be make to secure agreement for liquidation with the remain country whenever be in such condition that can be make those which have already be negotiate under the bipartisan commission establish by the congress have be make only after the most thoroughgoing and painstaking investigation continue for a long time before meeting with the representative of the country concern be believe that represent in each instance the good that can be do and the wise settlement that can be secure very important result be the stabilization of foreign currency make exchange assist rather than embarrass trade wherever sacrifice have be make of money will be more than amply return in well understanding and friendship while in so far as these adjustment will contribute to the financial stability of the debtor country to good order prosperity and progress represent hope of improved trade relation and mutual contribution to the civilization of the world alien problem negotiation be progress among the interested party in relation to the final distribution of the asset in the hand of the|alien|property|custodian government and people be interested as creditor the|german|government and people be interested as debtor and owner of the seize property pende the outcome of these negotiation do not recommend any affirmative legislation for the present should continue in possession of this property which hold as security for the settlement of claim due to people and government immigration while not enough time have elapse to afford a conclusive demonstration such result as have be secure indicate that immigration law be on the whole beneficial be undoubtedly a protection to the wage earner of this country the situation should however be carefully survey in order to ascertain whether be work a needless hardship upon own inhabitant if deprive of the comfort and society of those bind to by close family tie such modification should be adopt as will afford relief always in accordance with the principle that government owe first duty to own people and that no alien inhabitant of another country have any legal right whatever under constitution and law be only through treaty or through residence here that such right accrue but should not however be forgetful of the obligation of a common humanity while country number among good citizen many of those of foreign birth yet those who now enter in violation of law bi that very act thereby place in a class of undesirable t investigation reveal that any considerable number be come here in defiance of immigration restriction will undoubtedly create the necessity for the registration of all alien ought to have no prejudice against an alien because lie be an alien the standard which apply to inhabitant be that of manhood not place of birth restrictive immigration be to a large degree for economic purpose be apply in order that may not have a large annual increment of good people within border than can weave into economic fabric in such a way as to supply need without undue injury to national|defense never before in time of peace have country maintain so large and effective a military force as now have the army navy marine|corps national|guard and organized|reserves represent a strength of about|558,400 man these force be well train well equipped and high in morale a sound selective service act give broad authority for the mobilization in time of peril of all the resource of the country both person and material be need to perfect defense policy in accordance with ideal of equality the provision for more suitable housing to be pay for out of fund derive from the sale of excess land pende before the last congress ought to be bring forward and pass reasonable replacement ought to be make to maintain a sufficient ammunition reserve the navy have the full treaty tonnage of capital ship work be go forward in modernize the old one build aircraft carrier additional fleet submarine and fast scout cruiser but be carefully avoid anything that may be construe as a competition in armament with other nation the joint army and navy maneuver at hawaii follow by the cruise of a full battle|fleet to australia and new|zealand be successfully carry out these demonstration reveal a most satisfactory condition of the ship and the man engage last|year at suggestion the|general|board|of|the|navy make an investigation and report on the relation of aircraft to warship as a result authorization and appropriation be make for more scout cruiser and fleet submarine and for complete aircraft carrier and equip with necessary plane additional training in aviation be begin at the military and naval academies a method of coordination and cooperation of the army and navy and the principal aircraft builder be be perfect at the suggestion of the|secretaries|of|war|and|navy appoint a special board to make a further study of the problem of aircraft the report of the|air|board ought to be reassure to the country gratify to the service and satisfactory to the congress be thoroughly complete and represent the mature thought of the good talent in the country no radical change in organization of the service seem necessary the departments of war navy and commerce should each be provide with an additional assistant secretary not necessarily with statutory duty but who would be available under the direction of the secretary to give especial attention to air navigation must have an air strength worthy of america provision should be make for additional brigadier general for the|army|air|service temporary rank correspond to duty should be award to active fly officer in both army and navy aviation be of great importance both for national defense and commercial development ought to proceed in improvement by the necessary experiment and investigation country be not behind in this art have make record for speed and for the excellence of plane ought to go on maintain manufacturing plant capable of rapid production give national assistance to tile la in out of airway equip with a moderate number of plane and keep an air force train to the high efficiency while be a thorough believer in national defense and entirely commit to the policy of adequate preparation be just as thoroughly oppose to instigate or participate in a policy of competitive armament nor do preparation mean a policy of militarizing people and industry be solicitous for the cause of country and have great respect for the army and navy and foil the uniform wear by the man who stand ready at all time for protection to encounter the danger and peril necessary to military service but all of these activity be to be take not in behalf of aggression but in behalf of peace be the instrument by which undertake to do part to promote good will and support stability among all people veterans if any desire to estimate the esteem in which the veteran of america be hold by fellow citizen be but necessary to remember that the current budget call for an expenditure of about|$650,000.000 in behalf this be nearly the amount of the total cost of the|national|government exclusive of the post office before enter the last war at the previous session of congress legislation affect veteran ' relief be enact and the law liberalize this legislation bring into be a number of new provision tend more nearly to meet the need of veteran as well as afford the necessary authority to perfect the administration of these law experience with the new legislation so far have clearly demonstrate constructive nature have increase the benefit receive by many and bas make eligible for benefit many other direct disbursement to the veteran or dependent exceed have result which otherwise would not have be make the degree of utilization of hospital have increase through make facility available to the incapacitate veteran regardless of service origin of the disability this new legislation also have bring about a marked improvement of service to the veteran the organization of ex - service man have propose additional legislative change which will consider but until the new law and the modification make at the last session of congress be give a more thorough test further change in the basic law should be few and make only after careful though sympathetic consideration the principal work now before the|veterans'|bureau be the perfection of organization and further improvement in service some minor legislative change be deem necessary to enable the bureau to retain that high grade of professional talent essential in handle the problem of the bureau such change as tend toward the improvement of service and the carrying forward to completion of the hospital construction program be recommend for the consideration of the proper committee of congress with the enormous outlay that be now be make in behalf of the veteran and dependent with a tremendous war debt still require great annual expenditure with the still high rate of taxation while every provision should be make for the relief of the disabled and the necessary care of dependent the congress may well consider whether the financial condition of the government be not such that further bounty through the enlargement of general pension and other emolument ought not to be postpone agriculture no doubt the position of agriculture as a whole have very much improve since the depression of three|and|four|years|ago but there be many locality and many group of individual apparently through no fault of own sometimes due to climatic condition and sometimes to the prevailing price of a certain crop still in a distress condition this be probably temporary but be none the less acute national|government agency the|departments|of|agriculture|and|commerce the|farm|loan|board the intermediate credit bank and the|federal|reserve|board be all cooperate to be of assistance and relief on the other hand there be locality and individual who have have of their|most|prosperous|year the general price level be fair but here again there be exception both way some item be poor while other be excellent in spite of a lessened production the farm income for this|year will be about the same as last|year and much above the three|preceding|years agriculture be a very complex industry do not consist of problem but of several can not be solve at stroke have to be meet in different way and small gain be not to be despise have appear from all the investigation that have be able to make that the farmer as a whole be determined to maintain the independence of business do not wish to have meddle on the part of the government or to be place under the inevitable restriction involve in any system of direct or indirect price fixing which would result from permit the government to operate in the agricultural market be show a very commendable skill in organize to transact own business through cooperative marketing which will this|year turn over about|$2,500,000,000 or nearly|one fifth of the total agricultural business in this be receive help from the government the|department|of|agriculture should be strengthen in this facility in order to be able to respond when these marketing association ' want help while ought not to undertake undue regulation should be equip to give prompt information on crop prospect supply demand current receipt import export and price a bill embody these principle which have be draft under the advice and with the approval of substantially all the leader and manager in the cooperative movement will be present to the congress for enactment legislation should also be consider to provide for lease the unappropriated public domain for graze purpose and adopt a uniform policy relative to graze on the public land and in the national forest a more intimate relation should be establish between agriculture and the other business activity of the nation be mutually dependent and can each advance own prosperity most by advance the prosperity of the other meantime the government will continue those activity which have result in an unprecedented amount of legislation and the pour out of great sum of money during the work for good road well land and water transportation increase support for agricultural education extension of credit facility through the|farm|loan|board and the intermediate credit bank the encouragement of orderly marketing and a repression of wasteful speculation will all be continue follow every other depression after a short period the price of farm produce have take and maintain the lead in the advance this advance have reach a climax before the war everyone will recall the discussion that go on for four|or|five|years|prior|to|1914 concern the high cost of living this history be apparently begin to repeat while wholesale price of other commodity have be decline farm price have be increase there be every reason to suppose that a new era in agricultural prosperity lie just before which will probably be unprecedented muscle shoal the problem of muscle|shoals seem to to have assume a place all out of proportion with real importance probably do not represent in market value much more than a first class battleship yet have be discuss in the congress over a|period|of|years and for month at a time ought to be develop for the production of nitrate primarily and incidentally for power purpose this would serve defensive agricultural and industrial purpose be in favor of dispose of this property to meet these purpose the finding of the special commission will be transmit to the congress for information be convince that the good possible disposition can be make by direct authorization of the congress as a means of negotiation recommend the immediate appointment of a small joint special committee choose from the appropriate general stand committee of the house and senate to receive bid which when make should be report with recommendation as to acceptance upon which a law should be enact effect a sale to the high bidder who will agree to carry out these purpose if anything be need to demonstrate the almost utter incapacity of to deal directly with an industrial and commercial problem have be provide by experience with this property have expend vast fortune have tax everybody but be unable to secure result which benefit anybody this property ought to be transfer to private management under condition which will dedicate to the public purpose for which be conceive reclamation the|national|government be commit to a policy of reclamation and irrigation which desire to establish on a sound basis and continue in the interest of the locality concern exhaustive study have recently be make of federal reclamation which have result in improve the project and adjust many difficulty about|one|third of the project be in good financial condition another third can probably be make profitable while the other third be under unfavorable condition the congress have already provide for a survey which will soon be embody in a report that ought to suggest a method of relief which will make unnecessary further appeal to the congress unless this can be do federal reclamation will be considerably retard with the greatly increase cost of construction and operation have become necessary to plan in advance by community organization and selective agriculture method sufficient to repay these increase outlay the human and economic interest of the farmer citizen suggest that the states should be require to exert some effort and assume some responsibility especially in the intimate detailed and difficult work of secure settler and develop farm which directly profit but only indirectly and remotely can reimburse the nation be believe that the|federal|government should continue to be the agency for plan and construct the great undertaking need to regulate and bring into use the river the west many of which be interstate in character but the detailed work of create agricultural community and a rural civilization on the land make ready for reclamation ought to be either transfer to the state in entirety or make a cooperative effort of the|state|and|federal|government shipping the maintenance of a merchant marine be of the utmost importance for national defense and the service of commerce have a large number of ship engage in that service also have a surplus supply costly to care for which ought to be sell all the investigation that have be make under direction and those which have be prosecute independently have reach the conclusion that the fleet should be under the direct control of a single executive head while should exercise judicial and regulatory function in accordance with original conception the report of henry|g.|dalton a business man of broad experience with a knowledge of shipping make to after careful investigation will be transmit for the information of the congress the study pursue under the direction of the|united|states|chamber|of|commerce will also be accessible and add to these will be the report of the special committee of the house do not advocate the elimination of regional consideration but have become apparent that without centralized executive action the management of this great business like the management of any other great business will flounder in incapacity and languish under a division of council a plain and unmistakable reassertion of this principle of unified control which have always be advise be the intention of the congress to apply be necessary to increase the efficiency of merchant fleet coal the perennial conflict in the coal industry be still go on to the great detriment of the wage earner the owner and especially to the public with deposit of coal in this country capable of supply need for hundreds|of|years inability to manage and control this great resource for the benefit of all concerned be very close to a national economic failure have be the subject of repeat investigation and reiterate recommendation yet the industry seem never to have accept modern method of adjust difference between employer and employee the industry could serve the public much better and become subject to a much more effective method of control if regional consolidation and more freedom in the formation of marketing association under the supervision of the|department|of|commerce be permit at the present time the|national|government have little or no authority to deal with this vital necessity of the life of the country have permit to remain so powerless that only attitude must be humble supplication authority should be lodge with the president and the|departments|of|commerce and labor give power to deal with an emergency should be able to appoint temporary board with authority to call for witness and document conciliate difference encourage arbitration and in case of threatened scarcity exercise control over distribution make the fact public under these circumstance through a statement from an authoritative source would be of great public benefit the report of the last coal commission should be bring forward reconsider and act upon prohibition under the orderly process of fundamental institution the constitution be lately amend provide for national prohibition the congress pass an act for enforcement and similar act have be provide by most of the states be the law of the land be the duty of all who come under jurisdiction to observe the spirit of that law and be the duty of the|department|of|justice and the|treasury|department to enforce action to prevent smuggling illegal transportation in interstate commerce abuse in the use of permit and existence of source of supply for illegal traffic be almost entirely impose upon through treaty with foreign government and increase activity of the|coast|guard revenue agent district attorney and enforcement agent effort be be make to prevent these violation but the constitution also put a concurrent duty on the|state need active and energetic cooperation the vigilant action of police and the jurisdiction of court to assist in enforcement request of the people observance of the public officer continue effort for enforcement and of the congress favorable action on the budget recommendation for the prosecution of this work waterway development for many|year country have be employ in plan and m for the development of intracoastal and inland waterway this work along coast be an important adjunct to commerce will be carry on together with the further opening up of harbor as resource permit the government make an agreement during the war to take over the|cape|cod|canal under which the owner make valuable concession this pledge faith of the government ought to be redeem other main field be under consideration be the|great|lake and st.|lawrence include the|erie|canal this include stabilize the lake level and be both a waterway and power project a joint commission of the|united|state and canada be work on plan and survey which will not be complete until next|april no final determination can be make apparently except under treaty as to the participation of both country the other be the mississippi|river stem this be almost entirely devote to navigation work on the|ohio|river will be complete in about|three|years a modern channel connect chicago new|orleans kansas|city and pittsburgh should be lay out and work on the tributary prosecute some work be be do of a preparatory nature along the missouri and large expenditure be be make yearly in the low reach of the mississippi and tributary which contribute both to flood control and navigation preliminary measure be be take on tile colorado|river project which be exceedingly important for flood control irrigation power development and water supply to the area concern would seem to be very doubtful however whether be practical to secure affirmative action of the congress except under a joint agreement of the several states the government have already expend large sum upon scientific research and engineering investigation in promotion of this project the actual progress have be retard for many|year by difference among the states in the basin over relative water right and among different group as to method in an attempt to settle the primary difficulty of the water right congress authorize the|colorado|river|commission which agree on november|24,|1922 upon an interstate compact to settle these right subject to the ratification of the state legislature and congress all states except arizona at time ratified the|arizona|legislature make certain reservation which fail to meet the approval of the governor subsequently an attempt be make to establish the compact upon a state basis but in this case california impose reservation there appear to be no division of opinion upon the major principle of the compact but difficulty in separate contention to method of development from the discussion of be imperative that flood control be undertake for california and arizona preparation make for irrigation for power and for domestic water some or all of these question be combine in every propose development the|federal|government be interested in some of these phase state government and municipality and irrigation district in other and private corporation in still other because of all this difference of view be most desirable that congress should consider the creation of some agency that will be able to determine method of improvement solely upon economic and engineering fact that would be authorize to negotiate and settle subject to the approval of congress the participation right and obligation of each group in any particular work only by some such method can early construction be secure water power along with the development of navigation should go every possible encouragement for the development of water power while steam still play a dominant part this be more and more become an era of electricity once instal the cost be moderate have not tend greatly to increase and be entirely free from the unavoidable dirt and disagreeable feature attendant upon the burning of coal every facility should be extend for the connection of the various unit into a superpower plant capable at all time of a current increase uniformity over the entire system railroads the railroad throughout the country be in a fair state of prosperity service be good and supply of car be abundant condition would be improve and the public better serve by a system of consolidation recommend that the congress authorize such consolidation tinder the supervision of the|interstate|commerce|commission with power to approve or disapprove when propose part be exclude or new part add be inform that the railroad manager and employee have reach a substantial agreement as to what legislation be necessary to regulate and improve relationship whenever bring forward such proposal which seem sufficient also to protect the interest of the public should be enact into law be gratify to report that both the railroad manager and railroad employee be provide board for the mutual adjustment of difference in harmony with the principle of conference conciliation and arbitration the solution of problem ought to be an example to all other industry those who ask the protection of civilization should be ready to use the method of civilization a strike in modern industry have many of the aspect of war in the modern world injure labor and injure capital if the industry involve be a basic one reduce the necessary economic surplus and increase the cost of living injure the economic welfare and general comfort of the whole people also involve a deep cost tend to embitter and divide the community into warring class and thus weaken the unity and power of national life labor can make no permanent gain at the cost of the general welfare all the victory win by organize labor in the past generation have be win through the support of public opinion the manifest inclination of the manager and employee of the railroad to adopt a policy of action in harmony with these principle mark a new epoch in industrial life outlying possession the time have come for careful investigation of the expenditure and success of the law by which have undertake to administer outlying possession a very large amount of money be be expend for administration in alaska appear so far out of proportion to the number of inhabitant and the amount of production as to indicate cause for thorough investigation likewise consideration should be give to the experience under the law which govern the philippines from such report as reach there be indication that more authority should be give to the governor general so that will not be so dependent upon the local legislative body to render effective effort to set an example of the sound administration and good government which be so necessary for the preparation of the philippine people for self government under ultimate independence if be to be train in these art be duty to provide for the good that there be retirement of judges the|act|of|march|3,|1911 ought to be amend so that the term of year of service of judge of any court of the united|states requisite for retirement with pay shall 6e compute to include not only continuous but aggregate service mother aid the government ought always to be alert on the side of the humanity ought to encourage provision for economic justice for the defenseless ought to extend relief through national and local agency as may be appropriate in each case to the suffering and the needy ought to be charitable although more|than|40 of state have enact measure in aid of motherhood the|district|of|columbia be still without such a law a carefully consider bill will be present which ought to have most thoughtful consideration in order that the congress may adopt a measure which will be hereafter a model for all part of the union civil service in the congress pass the civil service act which from a modest beginning of employee have grow until there be now in the classified service this have remove the clerical force of the nation from the wasteful effect of the spoil system and make more stable and efficient the time have come to consider classify all postmaster collector of custom collector of internal revenue and prohibition agent by an act cover in those at present in office except when otherwise provide by executive order the necessary statistic be now be gather to form the basis of a valuation of the civil service retirement fund base on current condition of the service be confidently expect that this valuation will be complete in time to be make available to the congress during the present session will afford definite knowledge of exist and future liability under the present law and determination of liability under any propose change in the present law should have this information before create further obligation for retirement annuity which will become liability to be meet in the future from the money of the taxpayer the classification act of with the subsequent legislative action provide for adjustment of the compensation of field service position have operate materially to improve employment condition in the federal service the administration of the act be in the hand of an impartial board function without the necessity of a direct appropriation would be inadvisable at this time to place in other hand the administration of this act federal trade commission the proper function of the|federal|trade|commission be to supervise and correct those practice in commerce which be detrimental to fair competition in this perform a useful function and should be continue and support be design also to be a help to honest business in message to the sixty eighth congress recommend that change in the procedure then exist be make since then the commission by own action have reform rule give great speed and economy in the disposal of case and full opportunity for those accuse to be hear these change be improvement and if necessary provision should be make for permanency reorganization no final action have yet be take on the measure provide for the reorganization of the various department therefore suggest that this measure which will be of great benefit to the efficient and economical administration of the business of the government be bring forward and pass the negro nearly|one tenth of population consist of the negro race the progress which have make in all the art of civilization in the|last|60|years be almost beyond belief country have no more loyal citizen but do still need sympathy kindness and helpfulness need reassurance that the requirement of the government and society to deal out to even handed justice will be meet should be protect from all violence and support in the peaceable enjoyment of the fruit of labor those who do violence to should be punish for crime no other course of action be worthy of the american people country have many element in population many different mode of thinking and living all of which be strive in own way to be loyal to the high ideal worthy of the crown of american citizenship be fundamental of institution that seek to guarantee to all inhabitant the right to live own life under the protection of the public law this do not include any license to injure other materially physically morally to incite revolution or to violate the establish custom which have long bad the sanction of enlighten society but do mean the full right to liberty and equality before the law without distinction of race or creed this condition can not be grant to other or enjoy by except by the application of the principle of broad tolerance bigotry be only another name for slavery reduce to serfdom not only those against whom be direct but also those who seek to apply an enlarged freedom can only be secure by the application of the golden rule no other utterance ever present such a practical rule of life conclusion be apparent that be reach into an era of great general prosperity will continue only so long as shall use properly after all there be but a fix quantity of wealth in this country at any fix time the only way that can all secure more of be to create more the element of time enter into production if the people have sufficient moderation and contentment to be willing to improve condition by the process of enlarge production eliminate waste and distribute equitably a prosperity almost without limit lie before if the people be to be dominate by selfishness seek immediate rich by nonproductive speculation and by wasteful quarreling over the return from industry will be confront by the inevitable result of depression and privation if will continue industrious and thrifty content with fair wage and moderate profit and the return which accrue from tile development of oar natural resource prosperity will extend indefinitely in all deliberation should remember that the purpose of legislation be to translate principle into action be an effort to have country be well by do better because the thought and way of people be firmly fix and not easily change the field within which immediate improvement can be secure be very narrow legislation can provide opportunity whether be take advantage of or not depend upon the people the|government|of the|united|state have be create by the people be solely responsible to will be most successful if be conduct solely for benefit all effort would be of little avail unless bring more justice more enlightenment more happiness and prosperity into the home this mean an opportunity to observe religion secure education and earn a living under a reign of law and order be the growth and improvement of the material and spiritual life of the nation shall not be able to gain these end merely by own action if come at all will be because have be willing to work in harmony with the abide purpose of a divine providence transcript mr. moderator members of be understanding that the purpose of this council be to enlarge and improve the moral and spiritual life of the nation while appreciate that purpose be religious rather than political have feel a propriety in come here because of belief in the necessity for a grow reliance of the political success of government upon the religious conviction of people everyone recognize that modern life have become more and more complex have become more and more interdependent this be true in economic life be true in political life with the extension of knowledge and science with the new power that these have confer there be a multitude of way and opportunity for commit crime for do wrong which result in personal and property injury to other and for pervert that which ought to minister to well being to the service of evil end which in former|day do not exist new occasion have be open for the turning of the instrumentality of government which ought to be use for the public welfare into the service of selfish and misguided interest temptation have be both multiply and intensify the peril both to the individual and to society have in numerous way be increase manyfold be notorious that crime and violence always follow in the wake of war appear to be the rule that there be a dissolution of the old restraint bring about by the reaction which follow from the severe discipline and nervous tension of an era of conflict these may be and probably be a temporary state which will tend to disappear with the mere passage of time but too many of people have find oftentime to sorrow that the privilege of liberty instead of be easy to enjoy be in reality highly difficult responsibility require the utmost of effort for success nor can be deny that on the part of some there be a tendency to disregard too many of the former standard of society and too much of the former influence of authority another characteristic of present state of civilization which have already be note and comment upon be the disposition of those who be less well equipped to receive the benefit of the modern state of society through bear burden to attempt to resist all effort to subject to the necessary restraint and discipline and to try to tear down and destroy the result which other have secure by generation of constant effort what other have accumulate through industry and self denial propose to seize and to dissipate and destroy through indolence and self indulgence without compensation to rightful owner lawlessness be altogether too prevalent and a lack of respect for government and the convention of enlighten society be altogether too apparent be because do not know of any political method of adequately deal with these difficulty that have venture to bring to the attention of this council be natural to attempt to shift the blame from to other when evil condition arise be always easy to criticize the government for failure to reform all moral to prevent all crime and generally to abolish all evil have great faith in the local and national government of the|united|state but much of this field be beyond reach be not establish to discharge this duty be utterly unable to accomplish the chief function of organize government be to maintain order provide security for person and property and set up the instrumentality for the administration of justice this mean the making interpretation and the execution of the law through the legislature the judiciary the executive and all the various machinery of administration which these imply but ought always to be remember that institution have undertake to recognize that the human mind be and must be free this be of the reason why be neither practical nor justifiable to impose upon the government the responsibility for the ultimate provision of the instrumentality which minister to the spiritual life be true that the government can aid and be aid in the solution of some of the problem to which have already refer without doubt the law act as a deterrent to wrong do and will usually go a long way in the repression of crime but this reach high application only when there be a very healthy and determine public sentiment in favor of the observance of the law the utmost ingenuity on the part of the police power will be substantially all waste in an effort to enforce the law if there do not exist a strong and vigorous determination on the part of the people to observe the law such a determination can not be produce by the government own opinion be that be furnish by religion another contribution of great benefit which be carry on so successfully by the local public authority be that of education be well know that ignorance and vice and crime all flourish together local school which be sanction by the states and cherish by be institution of enormous value not only in provide earning for youth but in remove the prejudice which naturally would exist among various racial group and bring the rise generation of people to a common understanding a more thorough comprehension of political and social institution have rarely fail to produce a more loyal citizen with few exception those who come to as enemy of society be so because have always find society enemy to education in the element and fundamental of the american principle of human relationship have seldom fail to secure allegiance but the mere sharpening of the wit the bare training of the intellect the naked acquisition of science while would greatly increase the power for good likewise increase the power for evil an intellectual growth will only add to confusion unless be accompany by a moral growth do not know of any source of more power other than that which come from religion but there be another and more basic reason why the government can not supply the source and motive for the complete reformation of society in the progress of the human race religious belief be develop before the formation of government be understanding that government rest on religion while in own country have wisely separate the church and the state in order to emancipate faith from all political interference nevertheless the form and theory of government be lay in accordance with the prevail religious conviction of the people the great revival of the|middle|of|the|eighteenth|century have a mark influence upon revolutionary period the claim to the right to freedom the claim to the right to equality with the resultant right to self government the rule of the people have no foundation other than the common brotherhood of man derive from the common fatherhood of god the righteous authority of the law depend for sanction upon harmony with the righteous authority of the almighty if this faith be set aside the foundation of institution fail the citizen be depose from the high estate which hold as amenable to a universal conscience society revert to a system of class and caste and the government instead of be impose by reason from within be impose by force from without freedom and democracy would give way to despotism and slavery do not know of any adequate support for form of government except that which come from religion history have be mark by the contribution which have be make by clergyman to the cause of education and government need only to remind that the rev. thomas|shepherd be the leading influence in the establishment of the first college in the|united|state charter in massachusetts in two|years|later at hartford the rev. thomas|hooker be declare the fundamental principle upon which the|american|republic be to rest which be supplement early in the|next|century at ipswich by the writing and sermon of the rev. john|wise be understanding that these eminent divine be preach good congregational doctrine though of course many other denomination have just as vigorously support the same principle these contribution be not make in any narrow or lie sense but result from the broad general teaching of the necessity for an enlightened and consecrate people and from the conclusion draw from theology as to the relation of man to each other and to god the teaching of religion necessarily teach education and government be on this theory that institution of government rest do not look upon the authority of the state as something impose by a select few upon the masse of the people through the special dispensation of divine right or by the force of military power but rather recognize the universal divine right include all the people to govern in accordance with the dictate of a common conscience if the people be the government can not rise above can not furnish with something do not have will be what be this be true representation the government will be able to get out of the people only such virtue as religion have place there if society resist wrongdoe by punishment as must do unless be willing to approve through failure to resist for there be no middle ground may protect as be justify in do by restrain a criminal but that in and of do not reform be only a treatment of a symptom do not eradicate the disease do not make the community virtuous no amount of restraint no amount of law can do that if political and social standard be the result of an enlighten conscience then perfection depend upon secure a more enlighten conscience thomas|shepherd be not a great moral leader because believe in promote education believe in promote education because be a great moral leader and john|wise be not great spiritual light because declare the principle of sound government declare the principle of sound government because be great spiritual light be necessary to do something more than to have government treat symptom if be to preserve what already have and provide for further reformation must become a nation of partaker of the spirit of shepherd|and|hooker and wise or as the clergy tell must become partaker of the spirit of the|great|master this way be outside of the government be the realm of religion be this absolute necessity for support of the government outside through religion that wish to impress upon this assembly without that support political effort would be practically fruitless be not in any denominational or any narrow and technical sense that refer to religion mean to include all that can be bring within that broad general definition while regard the clergy as the great power for religious teaching that have do not refer to alone be conscious that the example of devoted man and woman the result of the inevitable social relation and above all the influence of piety in the home be all force of enormous significance while certain formality of the past may have lose the hold once have do not see any diminution in the steadfastness of the religious conviction of the people if these be break down society may go on for a time under own momentum but would be have for destruction do not possess any other enlightening force do not have any other hope for the reform and perfection of society there be no other method by which can have life and have more abundantly while have point out some of the difficulty and peril with which be threaten at the present time and while believe may well heed and be warn by be by no means desire to sound any note of discouragement the very fact that amid all the complexity and distraction of present life be still maintain unimpaire the foundation of institution constantly increase the rectitude with which the great business affair of country be conduct all the while improve educational facility answer more and more generously to the call of public and private charity continually enlarge the field of art give more and more attention to the humanity and become more and more responsive to spiritual thing appear to more to be incontrovertible evidence that though may be practice in a somewhat different manner than formerly the deep and abide faith of people in religion have not diminish but have increase have try to indicate what think the country need in the way of help under present condition need more religion if there be any general failure in the enforcement of the law be because there have first be general failure in the disposition to observe the law can conceive of no adequate remedy for the evil which beset society except through the influence of religion there be no form of education which will not fail there be no form of government which will not fail there be no form of reward which will not fail redemption must come through sacrifice and sacrifice be the essence of religion will be of untold benefit if there be a broad comprehension of this principle by the public and a continued preaching of this crusade by the clergy be only through these avenue by a constant renewal and extension of faith that can expect to enlarge and improve the moral and spiritual life of the nation without that faith all that have of an enlighten civilization can not endure transcript after anniversary repeatedly observe follow during by intensive celebration in this neighborhood where have beginning the|american|revolution should be fairly well understand if need any justification if need any praise be enough to say that product be america ought to be unnecessary on this occasion to dwell very much on that event and yet more remarkable result but no great movement in the progress of mankind have ever be accomplish without the guidance of an inspire leadership of this accept truth there be no more preeminent example than that which be reveal by the war which make this country independent wherever man love liberty wherever believe in patriotism wherever exalt high character by universal consent turn to the name of george|washington no occasion could be conceive more worthy more truly and comprehensively american than that which be choose to commemorate this divinely appoint captain the contemplation of life and work will forever strengthen faith in country and in country 's god those man who have take great part in the world be commonly rank by posterity accord to accomplishment while live and the permanent worth of the monument represent achievement which remain after be go by this standard think may regard george|washington as the first lie citizen of the world of all time be in whom the element of greatness be so evenly blend so accurately proportion that character have well nigh defy analysis other have create wide commotion and deep impression in the hour of eminence but shall hardly find one who in own day achieve so much as washington and leave work so firmly establish that posterity generation after generation can only increase tribute to ability wisdom patriotism and rounded perfection in the character of a christian citizen no figure in profane history have inspire so many testimony of admiration the high eloquence the most profound sincerity have be invoke to picture as the very sum of public capacity and civic virtue no pride of race or country have even attempt to set up rival to envy and malice have stand rebuke in the presence of towering form there be no language of literature and culture which do not boast among adornment noble eulogy of the work and character of washington although as history reckon period be but a little time since pass from the stage of life have be claim wherever man struggle and aspire as the possession of all humanity the first citizen of all the age so must be a strangely bold and self confident eulogist who would attempt even on such an occasion as this to add anything to the total of affection admiration and reverence which have be rear as the true memorial of washington be impossible for to add to or take from the estimate which have be fix by the generation of the world but if the preeminent place of washington be thus establish beyond possibility of change at hand be only the more desirable that on this anniversary should come here to do reverence and to seek replenishment of the inspiration which be always to be draw from consideration of life and work to the people of the republic whose existence be due to leadership life be the full and finished teaching of citizenship to other who may claim only by virtue of the right of humanity to be heir to all the age story be replete with example and admonition peculiarly applicable to the problem of the world and people in these time have come here because this|day|a|century|and|a|half|ago and in this place washington formally assume command of the army of the colonies foot trod this soil here be headquarters here be place of worship first view therefore be of washington the soldier but be indeed so much more than the soldier talent be so many and so perfectly proportion that be impossible to study in any of capacity to the exclusion of the other in find also a marvelous instinct for statecraft support and sustain an equal genius for camp and field see moreover the quality of a great man of business which be bring to serve the vast task of organize and equip army find on write a noble and eloquent rebuke to a commander of the king 's force who be bend on waive the law of civilized warfare and on another address compelling counsel of patriotism energy and executive sense to the|continental|congress and the provincial legislature in everything be call to be the leader in everything leadership work result which completely vindicate the confidence repose in the complaint have be many time uttered that washington be no nearly a paragon of ability and virtue that be impossible to see through the aura of perfection to the real simple human man but there be a phase of washington 's career which fully study and understand will give the picture of as of the most human man in history to inform of this human side need only to know of the|long|years of arduous preparation which precede the historic event which take place here to day from early manhood washington 's life have be a part of great affair many of those affair be vastly great and more significant than or indeed anybody else could possibly have realize at the time have come up through a schooling of strangely mingle adversity and success have devote hard and disappointing year to activity which result aside from the training which derive in little more than hopeless futility nobody can know the real washington the man washington without study closely service to the|virginia|colony and the british crown during the|year immediately precede and cover the old french|war here see as a young man in whom the combination of rare and remarkable part be most easily discern find at time hot head and impetuous always intensely impatient with incompetency in place of authority from the beginning discover a special genius for command the respect and attention of old man when hardly more than a boy be choose for a responsible and difficult mission to the french on the western frontier this mission bring in contact with an important french officer who report to government that this young man be likely to make more trouble for french interest in america than any other people that observation be more profound than maker could have realize washington have be send with a small force as the emissary of governor dinwiddie of virginia to notify the french that aggression in the upper ohio territory be occasion of deep concern to the british colony and must cease be the wish of washington and superior that the message be deliver without bring about any clash at arm but event decreed otherwise and a skirmish take place in the wilderness in which a number of man be kill and wound among a french officer of some rank and importance be deeply suggestive of the destiny which have mark washington that this backwood brush at arm should have occasion the first bloodshed in that long series of war which be to drench the|western|world for near generation and do not end until the downfall of napoleon from of that clash in the western forest of pennsylvania precipitate by the determination of washington to execute mission the seven|year ’ war be a foregone conclusion washington be denounce in france as a murderer a man eat freebooter of the wild in england boldness and determination win a good deal of reputation in the colonies there be much difference of opinion for the time be whether course be justify or have bring the country face to face with the possibility of a disastrous struggle at any rate from that|day until the downfall of napoleon|at|waterloo there be no peace in either europe or america save for brief period which represent little more than temporary truce doubtless that long and fearful series of conflict be inevitable whether be or not the fact of history show washington a youth of as the commander whose order prove the torch to set a world on fire from that|hour responsible man in both britain and france realize that there could be no last peace until those country have fight the duel which should determine the supremacy of or the other in the|new|world there be not room for both so come the seven|years’|war and the establishment of british domination in north|america a little later come the|american|revolution the|french|revolution and the napoleonic war can but wonder what may have be the reflection of washington if could have imagine on that july|morning of when resolve that must fight if could have know the train of event that would follow upon determination but such conjecture be of little value to there be more of immediate interest in the curious coincidence that the skirmish for possession of fort|necessity take place on july|3,|1754 exactly before the|day when washington in this place assume command of the|continental|army and those 21|year as washington live constitute a fitting probation for the career that await the echo of the little battle of fort|necessity reverberate throughout the|american|colony and the european court as if have be an engagement of titans political effect be tremendous make washington a marked man throughout the colonies and give a real european reputation part in the braddock expedition though vastly better known probably have less effect in form character or direct career than expedition to fort|necessity nevertheless reputation be further increase by conduct in the braddock campaign but that heroic episode be follow by a long and disappointing experience as head of the virginia forces defend the western frontier see little of satisfy service during this period but learn the supreme importance of organization and preparation in connection with military operation in the end be privilege to lead virginians to the occupation of fort|pitt when be finally surrender by the french but the real campaign for control of the|ohio|valley be make from the north by general wolfe on the plains of abraham rather than from virginia and washington find part in disappointingly small not only the braddock campaign of but early operation both diplomatic and military on the upper ohio mark as a man of caution sagacity and wisdom in planning and conduct military operation at the same time show as the intrepid and fearless fighting soldier in the hour of action thing that washington learn during the|french|war must have contribute greatly to form opinion about relation between britain and the colonies be bring to realize that the form of colonial government with which bitter experience make so familiar could not long satisfy the people of the large wealthy and fast grow colonies with washington the idea of substantial freedom long precede that of independence like most of the colonial youth hope that a more enlighten policy in london and a more sympathetic execution of by the royal governor may compose the grow difference during the troublous epoch between the|french|war and the revolution think deeply of these matter and correspondence give evidence of the grow impression that a contest must come follow the development of event in massachusetts with a close and understanding concern writing and occasional public pronouncement during this period show acutely anxious that the colonies should present a united front when the test come in position of leadership authority and independent fortune live as a virginia gentleman may easily enough have feel that the trouble of the|massachusetts|bay|colony have small concern for high churchman conformist in most thing enjoy excellent repute in england and with english official in america influence may logically enough have be throw to the royalist yet as early as the|spring|of|1769 write declare lordly master in great|britain will be satisfied with nothing less than the deprivation of american|freedom| and inquire what could be do to avert such a calamity add that no man should scruple or hesitate a moment to use arm in defense of so valuable a blessing be clearly opinion yet arm would beg to add should be the last resource a little later in that|same|year washington at a public meeting offer a nonimportation resolution and secure adoption in short be plain that be anxious to keep the sentiment of the southern colonies fully in step and sympathy with the attitude of the new|england patriot who at the moment be bear the brunt of the struggle or colonial right seemingly the boston port bill convince that the colonies must prepare for the harsh eventuality at a meeting of the citizen of county help draft a petition and remonstrance to the king which conclude with the ominous word from sovereign there can be but the appeal such a declaration come from whose repute be high in all the colonies and who be begin to speak with the voice of something like authority for the southern community could not fail to strengthen the arm and purpose of the selection of washington to command the continental armies have think be too much attribute to high military repute and too little to the fact that have long take the view of a true statesman regard the impending crisis the fact be that have all along see the struggle as a continental and national realize that massachusetts could not win alone nor could new|england in help to set up the committee of correspondence in mold the sentiment of virginia in service as member of the|continental|congress the ideal of a firm and whole hearted union of all the colonies be plainly fundamental repeatedly in writing even long before the struggle have seriously suggest the possibility of war use the phrase country give an application vastly broad than the domain or concern of any single colony be among the first to see the vision of an american|nation no other man so early grasp certain physical and geographic argument which urge nationality as inevitable in this engineering training together with intimate knowledge of the topography of the ohio and potomac|valleys have an important part as a young surveyor realize the importance of that break through the allegheny system which these valley mark point out strategic importance in connection with the defense and unity of the colonies front the atlantic before the ohio be much more than a myth to most people even in virginia washington see that the ohio basin must be control by the colonies if be to be secure thus be that a complete and clear vision of all the argument for national unity be due to the many sidedness of the washington mind see as politician as statesman as military man as engineer without such a grasp of all the element could not have take the statesmanly and essentially national view of the problem before hostility begin nor could have deal effectively with military aspect during the war possess of those rarely endow mind which not only recognize all the factor but assign to each proper weight be in truth a consummate politician when go to the sitting of the|continental|congress wear virginia uniform of buff and blue some be incline to ridicule the display of military predilection accuse of swashbuckle and point to uniform as equivalent to announcement of candidacy for commander in chief in the first be utterly wrong in the second quite probably right that uniform when preside over the committee on military preparation could hardly have be construe as mean anything other than that wearer realize what be ahead and be willing to force some part of that realization on other suppose if be to pick any man out of that gathering to be set down as something other than politician washington and sturdy old john|adam would be well toward the top in the polling though approach the matter from utterly different angle be both lead by the sagacity of great politician to the same conclusion to both the crisis be essentially national a nation must be create to deal with the army before boston must be take over by the congress as a national army there must be a commander in chief supreme in the military field all this look back upon as illumined statesmanship but statesmanship be nothing more than good sound politic test and prove that be what be when john|adams conceive the great strategy of call a man of the south to the chief command a more provincial man may have dream of massachusetts aid by the other colony take and hold the lead and garner the lion 's share of glory but adams be plan in term of a nation not of province and washington have for year be write of so washington put on uniform in testimony of readiness for whatever may happen and adams after some period of misgiving set about convince the delegate from new|england and the middle colonies that there must be a nation and a national army with a commander in chief and that must be washington be a stroke of political genius that adams soul of puritanic idealism should have move the adoption of the army by congress and the selection of washington as commander in chief the selection be make without a dissent vote though be not true to say that washington be unanimously prefer already there be clash ambition and divergent community interest but adams see and make other see the peculiar reason that urge washington the middle colonies dominate by landed aristocracy have much in common with the social and economic system of the south to washington mean the enlistment of property substance and eminent respectability in present name to the congress adams describe in term which seem prophetic and which can hardly improve a gentleman whose skill and experience as an officer whose independent fortune great talent and excellent universal character would command the approbation of all america and unite the cordial exertion of all the colonies better than any other person in the union let ever be set down to the glory of massachusetts that john|adams make george|washington commander in chief of the continental|armie and john|marshall chief justice of the|united|state destiny could have do no more immediately after selection washington set out from philadelphia for boston on the way receive first tiding of the|battle|of|bunker|hill which have be fight two|days after be name for commander inquire eagerly about the behavior of the continental troop and when learn now splendidly have fight against the british regular quietly declare that the liberty of the country be safe in that|anxious|hour the battle of in the pennsylvania wood wherein virginia militia have save braddock 's regular from destruction no doubt be near the top of mind to be assure that the raw levy of new|england be capable of behave just as well in as virginians have do in must have be intensely reassuring know the story of the revolution as do can not doubt that the historic event which take place here to day mark of crisis even with washington the struggle be well nigh lose at several period of course the ultimate separation of the colonies from the mother country be inevitable have fail as must have fail without washington there would have be harsh and vindictive reprisal nobody can read the arrogant pronouncement of lord north 's government or the still more arrogant letter of general gage to washington and avoid conviction that and american military representative would have vie with each other in effort to estrange the colonies such a policy would have establish tradition of animosity that would have keep the struggle alive even after a nominal peace in the end separation would have come but may have be delay through many recurrence of turbulence and struggle be vastly to the good of both the mother country and the colonies that the conflict be once begin be bring to a decisive conclusion there be another reason why the final victory of the colonies be important to the world be just as necessary for the maintenance of the|british|empire as for the proper development of the american community believe this view be now generally accept by british student as well as americans may be sure that be in the mind of the great chatham who have lay the foundation of the|british|empire in if there be a man in all that realm who may well have be give attention when the american crisis be develop that man be chatham have find britain weak and have build into strength have well nigh make the whole north|american continent british have reestablish the empire and extend in many direction yet chatham know that lord north 's policy would surely cost the loss of the american dominion emerge from a long political retirement defy the doctor hate and the king have serve the grand old man hurry down to the|house|of|lords to pronounce allegiance to the cause of the colonies when lordship say look at the paper transmit to from america when consider decency firmness wisdom can not but respect cause and wish to make own that decency firmness and wisdom be in no small part george|washington chatham know what have be to build an empire would not see throw away without have protest hear speak the voice of liberalism in england but the king and minister have no ear for such counsel have fix course and could not be swerve washington 's assumption of the command give the colonial cause an effective national character have not possess the genius and the power to impress other with that conception be hardly conceivable that disaster could long have be postpone find in command of an unorganized undisciplined unprovisioned and unmunitoned body of some|14,000 militia oppose an army of regular shut up in boston and support by a naval power that completely command the sea washington be call first to make an army then to drive enemy out of boston and then to meet attack at whatever point along the coast the enemy may choose where many other quite as sincere in patriotism fondly imagine that the evacuation of boston would move the london government to make peace be convince that would be little more than the beginning for the long struggle foresee have to prepare not only by create an army but by convince the civil authority and the people that must have the utmost measure of support and cooperation so find immediately upon assume command divide time between military task and the writing of endless letter to the leader of the congress to the provincial assembly to man of importance everywhere design to impress with the enormity of the come struggle this be not the time or place for a review of washington 's military career yet there be phase of that career which be never able to pass over without a word of wonder and admiration because of some of the exploit which include be record that a few evening after the surrender of lord|cornwallis|at|yorktown a banquet be give by washington and staff to the british commander and staff like to contemplate the sportsmanship of that function amiability and good wish be duly exchange and finally lord|cornwallis rise to present compliment to washington there have be much talk of past campaigning experience and cornwallis turn to washington express the judgment that when history 's verdict be make up the bright garland for excellency will be gather not from the shore of the chesapeake but from the bank of the delaware may fairly assume that cornwallis in the fullness of a very personal experience be qualified to judge washington have outgeneral and defeat both on the bank of the delaware and the shore of the chesapeake in give the laurel to the trenton princeton campaign express not only own judgment but the estimate which be afterwards pronounce by frederick|the|great who declare that the trenton princeton campaign be the most brilliant military performance of the|century for without pretense of military wisdom the lightninglike stroke of trenton and princeton in supreme audacity and ideal execution have always seem the most perfectly time combination of military genius and political wisdom that find in the record of warfare on the other hand much can be urge to support the claim that yorktown be the most brilliant campaign of washington with an army on the point of disintegration be almost utterly unable to get supply and transport yet manage to withdraw force from before new|york and get well on the way to virginia before enemy seriously suspect design be a miracle of military skill diplomacy and determination to effect on that consolidation of force from south and north along with the french army and fleet at precisely the right moment the essence of strategy be to divide the force of the enemy and defeat in detail and there be few campaign which show a commander accomplish this through operation cover so extend a territory and involve so many difficulty in the yorktown campaign sell all the varied element of washington 's genius at work have to deal at once with an inert congress that be threaten at this critical moment actually to reduce the army have to find supply and money or get along without in part do in part the other have to effect a junction of widely separate force and to maintain secrecy to the last moment everything must be alone within a period of time so short that may well have make success appear utterly impossible because could not count on the cooperation of the french for a long period all these thing accomplish accomplish win the war as in the campaign of trenton and princeton have save the revolution no man could have render service to the revolution who be not both a soldier and statesman understand and never underestimate the political bearing of every move when retire to mount|vernon washington enter upon a new phase of career have win the war but be a man of peace experience as commander in chief have completely convince that the form of government under the confederation could not possibly serve the necessity of the country be not possible here to outline the discouragement which threaten the country with all manner disaster washington as the most influential citizen be the inevitable leader in prepare for and the establishment of a real nation that task take up early and to devote an energy and a wisdom that be alike amazing be quite natural that should be choose to preside over the|constitutional|convention when work be do influence be of the chief force to bring about ratification after that there be none to question that must be the first president under the new régime perhaps no character in history have be subject to more close study or sympathetic analysis than that of washington the volume of writing which have be leave to be enormous moreover from early manhood life be live almost continuously under intense public observation be therefore remarkable that biographer and eulogist should be so generally accuse of fail to give a satisfying picture of the fault however be not but the explanation be that no biographer have possess and probably none ever will possess the full rounded measure of qualification to appreciate to understand to apportion and to weigh all the element that make this man unfortunately a vast myth be early build around washington difficult to avoid and not even yet entirely dissipate among biographer and eulogist some have see first and most admiringly the great soldier some have be most engage with as the statesman politician deal with great affair from day to day as circumstance demand other have devote particularly to portray as the constructive student of government and builder of institution still other have find first inspiration in work as a wise firm and discriminate administrator volume have be write and be exceedingly interesting volume on washington as a pioneer of modern scientific agriculture be interesting to recall that in taste for agriculture washington and great antagonist king george|iii stand on a common ground whoever care to familiarize with this particular detail on the career of washington and the king will find that these may in other circumstance have be the good of friend for both be devoted admirer and supporter of arthur|young the famous english traveler and agricultural authority in the|last|year or before the beginning of the|french|revolution young travel extensively throughout france keep a journal of observation and experience that have since be invaluable to whoever wish to know condition in the france of that time besides all this arthur|young be almost the founder of the modern science and technique of advanced agriculture write and publish voluminously on such subject as rotation of crop scientific fertilization farm drainage the breeding of livestock the growing of plant and many other subject which be now commonplace king george become interested in work and turn over to some farm of the royal domain to be conduct as the early agricultural experiment station young publish an agricultural journal devote to theory and experiment and to washington become a subscriber this lead into a correspondence with young which seem to have be quite extend convince that the young program represent much of value to american agriculture washington offer to set aside of farm to be manage by english expert if young would enlist apparently nothing finally come of this proposal but the act that be make and seriously consider show how near washington and king george come to an intimate association for the betterment of agriculture indeed inside of two|year after the end of appeal to young to buy and ship to an invoice of agricultural implement and seed with which washington desire to experiment on investigation young discover that british law forbid these export so go to the minister for home affairs lord grenville and plead for permission to send be immediately grant and by the courtesy of the entire order be fill the incident be an interesting indication of the liberal disposition manifest so soon after the war by lead man of both country be a pleasant thing to be privilege to recall on an occasion like this such a bit of evidence touch the underlie community of interest between the old kingdom and the new republic in matter of common concern and human advancement washington be the last person to harbor resentment and in and other instance more than once find former enemy ready to meet half way as look back now on a|century and more of uninterrupted peace between the nation can not but feel that such peace and the long period of international cooperation which have make possible have be in no small part a testimony to the generous willingness of all man everywhere to recognize as the first citizen of the world who have be so long acclaim as the first american have be expectation to confine address to general|washington and leave the stately and solemn grandeur of this great figure as the sole subject for the thought of those who may hear shall not enter into the vain speculation of what may do if be live to day yet farewell address show conclusively that hope to be able to lay down certain principle of conduct for fellow countryman which would be of advantage to so long as the nation into which have work life may endure no doubt know the whole world would hear have see the life of the soldier in time of war and after that of the statesman in time of peace have an abide faith in honesty believe mightily in fellow man the vigor with which insist on the prosecution of war be no less than the vigor with which insist on the observance of peace cherish no resentment harbor no hatred forgive enemy feel the same obligation to execute the term of a treaty make for the benefit of a former foe that feel to require the observance of those make for the benefit of own country realize that peace could be the result only of mutual forbearance and mutual good faith harmonize the divergent and conflict interest of different nationality and different colonial government by conference and agreement demonstrate by argument and country have demonstrate by experience that more progress can be make by cooperation than by conflict to agree quickly with adversary always pay the world have not outgrow can never outgrow the absolute necessity for conformity to these eternal principle want to see america assume a leadership among the nation in the reliance upon the good faith of mankind do not see how civilization can expect permanent progress on any other theory if what be save in the productive peace of to day be to be lose in the destructive war of to morrow the people of this earth can look forward to nothing but everlasting servitude there be no justification for hope this be not the conception which washington have of life if the people of the old world be mutually distrustful of each other let enter into mutual covenant for mutual security and when such covenant have be make let be solemnly observe no matter what sacrifice have settle the far more difficult problem of reparation be in process of fund debt to why can not agree on permanent term of peace and fully reestablish international faith and credit if there be difference which can not be adjust at the moment if there be condition which can not be foresee let be resolve in the future by method of arbitration and by the form of judicial determination while own country should refrain from make political commitment where do not have political interest such covenant would always have the moral support of government and could not fail to have the commendation of the public opinion of the world such a course would be sure to endow the participate nation with an abundant material and spiritual reward on what other basis can there be any encouragement for a disposition to attempt to finance a revival of europe the world have try war with force and have utterly fail the only hope of success lie in peace with justice no other principle conform to the teaching of washington no other

scholar to preparesuch a work for adoption by the various nation should have sympathyand support much may be hope for from the earnest study of those whoadvocate the outlawing of aggressive war but all these plan and preparation these treaty and covenant will not of be adequate ofthe great danger to peace lie in the economic pressure to which peoplefind subject of the most practical thing to be donein the world be to seek arrangement under which such pressure may be remove so that opportunity may be renew and hope may be revive there mustbe some assurance that effort and endeavor will be follow by successand prosperity in the making and financing of such adjustment there isnot only an opportunity but a real duty for america to respond with hercounsel and resource condition must be provide under which peoplecan make a living and work out of difficulty but there be anotherelement more important than all without which there can not be the slightesthope of a permanent peace that element lie in the heart of humanity unless the desire for peace be cherish there unless this fundamentaland only natural source of brotherly love be cultivate to highestdegree all artificial effort

that have always workedperfectly be enough to know that nothing well have be devise noone would deny that there should be full and free expression and an opportunityfor independence of action within the party there be no salvation in anarrow and bigoted partisanship but if there be to be responsible partygovernment the party label must be something more than a mere device forsecuring office unless those who be elect under the same party designationare willing to assume sufficient responsibility and exhibit sufficientloyalty and coherence so that can cooperate with each other in thesupport of the broad general principle of the party platform the electioni merely a mockery no decision be make at the poll and there be norepresentation of the popular will common honesty and good

have enormous debt to pay and be pay have the high cost of government to diminish and be diminish have a heavy burden of taxation to reduce and be reduce but while remarkable progress have be make in these direction the work be yet far from accomplish still owe over|$21,000,000,000 the cost of the|national|government be still and the national taxis still amount to about|$27 for each of inhabitant there yet exist this enormous field for the application of economy in opinion the government can do more to remedy the economic ill of the people by a system of rigid economy in public expenditure than can be accomplish through any other action the cost of national and local government combine now stand at a sum close|to|$100 for each inhabitant of the land a little less than third of this be represent by national expenditure and a little more than third by local expenditure be an ominous fact that only the|national|government be reduce debt other be increase at about|$1,000,000,000 each year the depression that overtake business the disaster experience in agriculture the lack of employment and the terrific shrinkage in all value which country experience in a most acute form in result in no small measure from the prohibitive taxis which be then levy on all productive effort the establishment of a system of drastic economy in public expenditure which have enable to pay off about|one fifth of the national debt since and almost cut in the national tax burden since have be of the main cause in reestablish a prosperity which have come to include within benefit almost every of inhabitant economy reach everywhere carry a blessing to everybody the fallacy of the claim that the cost of government be bear by the rich and those who make a direct contribution to the|national|treasury can not be too often expose no system have be devise do not think any system could be devise under which any person live in this country could escape be affect by the cost of government have a direct effect both upon the rate and the purchasing power of wage be feel in the price of those prime necessity of existence food clothing fuel and shelter would appear to be elementary that the more the government expend the more must require every producer to contribute out of production to the|public|treasury and the less will have for own benefit the continue cost of public administration can be meet in only|one way by the work of the people the high become the more the people must work for the government the less be the more the people can work for the present estimate margin between public receipt and expenditure for this|fiscal|year be very small perhaps the most important work that this session of the congress can do be to continue a policy of economy and further reduce the cost of government in order that may have a reduction of taxis for the|next|fiscal|year nothing be more likely to produce that public confidence which be the forerunner and the mainstay of prosperity encourage and enlarge business opportunity with ample opportunity for employment at good wage provide a large market for agricultural product and put country in a strong position to be able to meet the world competition in trade than a continue policy of economy of course necessary cost must be meet proper function of the government perform and constant investment for capital account and reproductive effort must be carry on by various department but the people must know that government be place upon no unnecessary burden taxes everyone desire a reduction of taxis and there be a great preponderance of sentiment in favor of taxation reform when approve the present tax law state publicly that do so in spite of certain provision which believe unwise and harmful of the most glaring of these be the make public of the amount assess against different income tax payer although that damage have now be do believe continuation to be detrimental to the public welfare and bind to decrease public revenue so that ought to be repeal anybody can reduce taxis but be not so easy to stand in the gap and resist the passage of increase appropriation bill which would make tax reduction impossible will be very easy to measure the strength of the attachment to reduce taxation by the power with which increase appropriation be resist if at the close of the present session the congress have keep within the budget which propose to present will then be possible to have a moderate amount of tax reduction and all the tax reform that the congress may wish for during the|next|fiscal|year the country be now feel the direct stimulus which come from the passage of the last revenue bill and under the assurance of a reasonable system of taxation there be every prospect of an era of prosperity of unprecedented proportion but would be idle to expect any such result unless business can continue free from excess profit taxation and be accord a system of surtax at rate which have for object not the punishment of success or the discouragement of business but the production of the great amount of revenue from large income be convince that the large income of the country would actually yield more revenue to the government if the basis of taxation be scientifically revise downward moreover the effect of the present method of this taxation be to increase the cost of interest on productive enterprise and to increase the burden of rent be altogether likely that such reduction would so encourage and stimulate investment that would firmly establish country in the economic leadership of the world waterway meantime internal development should go on provision should be make for flood control of such river as the mississippi and the colorado and for the opening up of inland waterway to commerce consideration be due to the project of well navigation from the|great|lake to the gulf every effort be be make to promote an agreement with canada to build the st.|lawrence waterway there be pende before the congress bill for further development of for the taking over of the|cape|cod|canal in accordance with a moral obligation which seem to have be incur during the war and for the improvement of harbor on both the pacific and the atlantic coast while this last should be divest of some of project and must proceed slowly these bill in general have approval such work be productive of wealth and in the long run tend to a reduction of the tax burden reclamation country have a well define policy of reclamation establish under statutory authority this policy should be continue and make a self sustain activity administer in a manner that will meet local requirement and bring and land into a profitable state of cultivation as fast as there be a market for product legislation be pende base on the report of the|fact|finding|commission for the proper relief of those need extension of time in which to meet payment on irrigated land and for additional amendment and reform of reclamation law which be all exceedingly important and should be enact at once no more important development have take place in the|last|year than the beginning of a restoration of agriculture to a prosperous condition must permit no division of class in this country with occupation strive to secure advantage over another each must proceed under open opportunity and with a fair prospect of economic equality the government can not successfully insure prosperity or fix price by legislative fiat every business have risk and time of depression be well know that in the long run there will be a more even prosperity and a more satisfactory range of price under the natural work out of economic law than when the government undertake the artificial support of market and industry still can so order affair so protect own people from foreign competition so arrange national finance so administer monetary system so provide for the extension of credit so improve method of distribution as to provide a well work machinery for the transaction of the business of the nation with the least possible friction and loss the government have be constantly increase effort in these direction for the relief and permanent establishment of agriculture on a sound and equal basis with other business be estimate that the value of the crop for this|harvest|year may reach which be an increase of over|$3,000,000,000 in three|years compare with in arid if make deduction from the figure of for the comparatively decrease value of the dollar the yield this|year still exceed in purchase power by over|$1,000,000,000 and in this interval there have be no increase in the number of farmer mostly by own effort the farmer have decrease the cost of production a marked increase in the price of product and some decrease in the price of supply have bring about to a parity with the rest of the nation the crop area of this|season be estimate at which be a decline of 3,000,000|acre from last|year and from this have be a normal and natural application of economic law which have place agriculture on a foundation which be undeniably sound and begin to be satisfactory a decrease in the world supply of wheat have result in a very large increase in the price of that commodity the position of all agricultural product indicate a better balanced supply but can not yet conclude that agriculture be recover from the effect of the war period or that be permanently on a prosperous basis the cattle industry have not yet recover and in some section have be suffer from dry weather every effort must be make both by government activity and by private agency to restore and maintain agriculture to a complete normal relationship with other industry be on account of past depression and in spite of present more encouraging condition that have assemble an agricultural|conference make up of those who be representative of this great industry in both operating and economic side everyone know that the great need of the farmer be market the country be not suffer on the side of production almost the entire difficulty be on the side of distribution this reach back of course to unit cost and diversification and many allied subject be exceedingly intricate for domestic and foreign trade transportation and banking and in fact entire economic system be closely related to in time for action at this session hope to report to the congress such legislative remedy as the conference may recommend an appropriation should be make to defray necessary expense muscle shoal the production of nitrogen for plant food in peace and explosive in war be more and more important be of the chief sustain element of life be estimate that soil exhaustion each|year be represent by about|9,000,000|ton and replenishment by 5,450,000|ton the deficit of 3,550,000|tons be report to represent the impairment of of farm land each year to meet these necessity the government have be develop a water power project at muscle|shoal to be equip to produce nitrogen for explosive and fertilizer be opinion that the support of agriculture be the chief problem to consider in connection with this property could by no mean supply the present need for nitrogen but would help and development would encourage bring other water power into like use several offer have be make for the purchase of this property probably none of represent final term much costly experimentation be necessary to produce commercial nitrogen for that reason be a field better suit to private enterprise than to government operation should favor a sale of this property or long time lease tinder rigid guaranty of commercial nitrogen production at reasonable price for agricultural use there would be a surplus of power for many|year over any possibility of application to a develop manufacture of nitrogen may be find advantageous to dispose of the right to surplus power separately with such reservation as will allow gradual withdrawal and application to nitrogen manufacture a subcommittee of the|committees|on|agriculture should investigate this field and negotiate with prospective purchaser if no advantageous offer be make the development should continue and the plant should be dedicate primarily to the production of material for the fertilization of the soil railway the railway during the|past|year have make still further progress in recuperation from the war with large rain in efficiency and ability expeditiously to handle the traffic of the country have now pass through several period of peak traffic without the car shortage which so frequently in the past have bring havoc to agriculture and industry the condition of many of great freight terminal be still of difficulty and result in impose large cost on the public for inward bind freight and on the railway for outward bound freight owe to the growth of large city and the great increase in the volume of traffic particularly in perishable the problem be not only difficult of solution but in some case not wholly solvable by railway action alone in message last|year emphasize the necessity for further legislation with a view to expedite the consolidation of rail way into large system the principle of government control of rate and profit now thoroughly imbed in governmental attitude toward natural monopoly such as the railway at once eliminate the need of competition by small unit as a method of rate adjustment competition must be preserve as a stimulus to service but this will exist and can be increase tinder enlarge system consequently the consolidation of the railway into large unit for the purpose of secure the substantial value to the public which will come from large operation have be the logical conclusion of congress in previous enactment and be also support by the good opinion in the country such consolidation will assure not only a great element of competition as to service but will afford economy in operation great stability in railway earning and more economical financing open large possibility of well equalization of rate between different class of traffic so as to relieve undue burden upon agricultural product and raw material generally which be now not possible without ruin to small unit owe to the lack of diversity of traffic would also tend to equalize earning in such fashion as to reduce the importance of section at which criticism often misapply have be direct a small number of unit would offer less difficulty in labor adjustment and would contribute much to the solution of terminal difficulty the consolidation need to be carry out with due regard to public interest and to the right and establish life of various community in country do not seem to necessary that endeavor to anticipate any final plan or adhere to an artificial and unchangeable project which shall stipulate a fix number of system but rather ought to approach the problem with such a latitude of action that can be work out step by step in accordance with a comprehensive consideration of public interest whether the number of ultimate system shall be more or less seem to can only be determine by time and actual experience in the development of such consolidation those portion of the present law contemplate consolidation ore not sufficiently effective in produce expeditious action and need amplification of the authority of the|interstate|commerce|commission particularly in afford a period for voluntary proposal to the commission and in supply government pressure to secure action after the expiration of such a period there be other proposal before congress for amend the transportation act of these contemplate a revision of the method of valuation for rate make purpose to be follow by a renew valuation of the railway the valuation institute by the|interstate|commerce|commission have not yet be complete have cost the government an enormous sum and have impose great expenditure upon the railway most of which have in effect come out of the public in increase rate this work should not be abandon or supplant until result be know and can be consider another matter before the congress be legislation affect the labor section of the transportation act much criticism have be direct at the working of this section and experience have show that some useful amendment could be make to these provision would be helpful if a plan could be adopt which while retain the practice of systematic collective bargaining with conciliation voluntary arbitration of labor difference could also provide simplicity in relation and more direct local responsibility of employee and manager but such legislation will not meet the requirement of the situation unless recognize the principle that t e public have a right to the uninterrupted service of transportation and therefore a right to be hear when there be danger that the nation may suffer great injury through the interruption of operation because of labor dispute if these element be not comprehend in propose legislation would be well to gain further experience with the present organization for deal with these question before undertake a change shipping board the form of the organization of the|shipping|board be base originally on function as a semi judicial body in regulation of rate during the war be load with enormous administrative duty have be demonstrate time and again that this form of organization result in indecision division of opinion and administrative function which make a wholly inadequate foundation for the conduct of a great business enterprise the first principle in secure the objective set out by congress in build up the american merchant marine upon the great trade route and subsequently dispose of into private operation can not proceed with effectiveness until the entire function of the board be reorganize the immediate requirement be to transfer into the|emergency|fleet corporation the whole responsibility of operation of the fleet and other property leave to solely the duty of determine certain major policy which require deliberative action the procedure under section|28 of the merchant marine act have create great difficulty and threaten friction during the|past|12|month attempt application develop not only great opposition from exporter particularly as to burden that may be impose upon agricultural product but also great anxiety in the different seaport as to the effect upon relative rate structure this trouble will certainly recur if action be attempt under this section be uncertain in some of term and of great difficulty in interpretation be belief that action under this section should be suspend until the congress can reconsider the entire question in the light of the experience that have be develop since enactment national|elections nothing be so fundamental to the integrity of a republican form of government as honesty in all that relate to the conduct of election be of the opinion that the national law govern the choice of member of the congress should be extend to include appropriate representation of the respective party at the ballot box ant equality of representation on the various registration board wherever exist the judiciary the docket of the|supreme|court be become congest at the opening term last|year have case while this|year have case justice long delay be justice refuse unless the court be give power by preliminary and summary consideration to determine the importance of case and by dispose of those which be not of public moment reserve time for the more extended consideration of the remainder the congestion of the docket be likely to increase be also desirable that supreme|court should have power to improve and reform procedure in suit at law in the federal court through the adoption of appropriate rule the|judiciary|committee|of|the|senate have report favorably upon bill provide for these reform which should have the immediate favorable consideration of the congress further recommend that provision be make for the appointment of a commission to consist of or member of the federal judiciary and as many member of the bar to examine the present criminal code of procedure and recommend to the congress measure which may reform and expedite court procedure in the administration and enforcement of criminal law prison reform pende before the congress be a bill which have already pass house provide for a reformatory to which could be commit first offender and young man for the purpose of segregate from contact with ban criminal and provide with special training in order to reestablish in the power to pursue a law abide existence in the social and economic life of the nation this be a matter of so much importance as to warrant the early attention of the present session further provision should also be make for a like reason for a separate reformatory for woman national|police|bureau representative of the|international|police|conference will bring to the attention of the congress a proposal for the establishment of a national police bureau such action would provide a central point for gathering compile and later distribute to local police authority much information which would be helpful in the prevention and detection of crime believe this bureau be need and recommend favorable consideration of this proposal district of columbia welfare the welfare work of the|district|of|columbia be administer by several different board deal with charity and various correctional effort would be an improvement if this work be consolidate and place under the direction of a single commission french|spoliation|claims during the last session of the congress legislation be introduce look to the payment of the remain claim generally refer to as the french spoliation claim the congress have provide for the payment of many similar claim those that remain unpaid have be long pende the beneficiary thereunder have every reason to expect payment these claim have be examine by the|court|of|claims and validity and amount determine the|united|state ought to pay debt recommend action by the congress which will permit of the payment of these remain claim the wage earner very important policy have be adopt by this country which while extend benefit also in other direction have be of the utmost importance to the wage earner of these be the protective tariff which enable people to live accord to a well standard and receive a well rate of compensation than any people any time anywhere on earth ever enjoy this save the american market for the product of the american workman the other be a policy of more recent origin and seek to shield wage earner from the disastrous competition of a great influx of foreign people this have be do by the restrictive immigration law this save the american job for the american workman should like to see the administrative feature of this law render a little more humane for the purpose of permit those already here a great latitude in secure admission of member of own family but believe this law in principle be necessary and sound and destine to increase greatly the public welfare must maintain own economic position must defend own national integrity be gratify to report that the progress of industry the enormous increase in individual productivity through labor save device and the high rate of wage have all combine to furnish people in general with such an abundance not only of the necessary but of the convenience of life that be by a natural evolution solve problem of economic and social justice the negro these development have bring about a very remarkable improvement in the condition of the negro race gradually but surely with the almost universal sympathy of those among whom live the colored people be work out own destiny firmly believe that be well for all concerned that should be cheerfully accord full constitutional right that should be protect from all of those imposition to which from position naturally fall a prey especially from the crime of lynching and that should receive every encouragement to become full partaker in all the blessing of common american citizenship civil service the merit system have long be recognize as the correct basis for employment in civil service believe that first second and third class postmaster and without cover in the present membership tile field force of prohibition enforcement should be bring within the classified service by statute law otherwise the executive order of administration be change by the executive order of another administration and little real progress be make whatever defect the merit system be certainly to be prefer to the spoil system departmental reorganization way to save public money would be to pass the pende bill for the reorganization of the various department this project have be pende for some time and have have the most careful consideration of expert and the thorough study of a special congressional committee this legislation be vital as a companion piece to the budget law legal authority for a thorough reorganization of the federal structure with some latitude of action to the executive in the rearrangement of secondary function would make for continue

association of which the chief and most representative be the|american|legion through officer the legion will present to the congress numerous suggestion for legislation cover such a wide variety of subject that be impossible to discuss within the scope of this message with many of the proposal join in hearty approval and commend all to the sympathetic investigation and consideration of the congress foreign relation at no period in the|past|12|year have foreign relation be in such a satisfactory condition as be at the present time action in the|recent|month have greatly strengthen the american policy of permanent peace with independence the attitude which government take and maintain toward an adjustment of european reparation by point out that wit not a political but a business problem have demonstrate wisdom by actual result desire to see europe restore that may resume productivity in the increase of industry and support in the advance of civilization look with great gratification at the hopeful prospect of recuperation in europe through the dawes plan such assistance as can be give through the action of the public authority and of private citizen through friendly counsel and cooperation and through economic and financial support not for any warlike effort but for reproductive enterprise not to provide mean for unsound government financing but to establish sound business administration should be unhesitatingly provide ultimately nation like individual can not depend upon each other but must depend upon each one must work out own salvation have every desire to help but with all resource be powerless to save unless effort meet with a constructive response the situation in own country and all over the world be chat can be improve only by bard work and self denial be necessary to reduce expenditure increase saving and liquidate debt be in this direction that there lie the great hope of domestic tranquility and international peace own country ought to finish the lead example in this effort past adherence to this policy constant refusal to maintain a military establishment that could be think to menace the security of other honorable dealing with other nation whether great or small have leave in the almost constant enjoyment of peace be not necessary to stress the general desire of all the people of this country for the promotion of peace be the leading principle of all foreign relation have on every occasion try to cooperate to this end in all way that be consistent with proper independence and traditional policy will be constant effort to maintain these principle and to reinforce by all appropriate agreement and treaty while desire always to cooperate and to help be equally determined to be independent and free right and truth and justice and humanitarian effort will have the moral support of this country all over the world but do not wish to become involved in the political controversy of other nor be the country dispose to become a member of the|league|of|nations or to assume the obligation impose by covenant international court america have be of the foremost nation in advocate tribunal for the settlement of international dispute of a justiciable character representative take a leading in those conference which result in the establishment of e ague tribunal and later in provide for a|permanent|court|of|international|justice believe would be for the advantage of this country and helpful to the stability of other nation for to adhere to the protocol establish that court upon the condition state in the recommendation which be now before the senate and further that country shall not be bind by advisory opinion which may be render by the court upon question which have not voluntarily submit for judgment this court would provide a practical and convenient tribunal before which could go voluntarily but to which could not be summon for a determination of justiciable question when fail to be resolve by diplomatic negotiation disarmament conference many time have express desire to see the work of the|washington|conference|on|limitation|of|armaments appropriately supplement by further agreement for a further reduction m for the purpose of diminish the menace and waste of the competition in prepare instrument of international war have be and be expectation that may hopefully approach other great power for further conference on this subject as soon as the carrying out of the present reparation plan as the establish and settle policy of europe have create a favorable opportunity but on account of proposal which have already be make by other government for a european conference will be necessary to wait to see what the outcome of action may be should not wish to propose or have representative attend a conference which would contemplate commitment oppose to the freedom of action desire to maintain unimpaired with respect to purely domestic policy international law country should also support effort which be be make toward the codification of international law can look more hopefully in the first instance for research and study that be likely to be productive of result to a cooperation among representative of the bar and member of international law institute and society than to a conference of those who be technically representative of respective government although when project have be develop must go to the government for approval these expert professional study be go on in certain|quarter and should have constant encouragement and approval outlaw of war much interest have of late be manifest in this country in the discussion of various proposal to outlaw aggressive war look with great sympathy upon the examination of this subject be in harmony with the traditional policy of country which be against aggressive war and for the maintenance of permanent and honorable peace while as have say must safeguard liberty to deal accord to own judgment with domestic policy can not fail to view with sympathetic interest all progress to this desire end or carefully to study the measure that may be propose to attain latin america while be desirous of promote peace in every quarter of the globe have a special interest in the peace of this hemisphere be constant desire that all cause of dispute in this area may be tranquilly and satisfactorily adjust along with desire for peace be the earnest hope for the increase prosperity of sister republic of latin|america and constant purpose to promote cooperation with which may be mutually beneficial and always inspire by the most cordial friendship foreign debt about|$12,000,000,000 be due to government from abroad mostly from european|governments great|britain finland hungary lithuania and poland have negotiate settlement amount close|to|$5,000,000,000 this represent the funding of over per cent of the debt since the creation of the special foreign|debt|commission as the life of this commission be about to expire term should be extend be oppose to the cancellation of these debt and believe for the good welfare of the world that should be liquidate and pay as fast as possible do not favor oppressive measure but unless money that be borrow be repay credit can not be secure in time of necessity and there exist besides a moral obligation which country can not ignore and no other country can evade term and condition may have to conform to difference in the financial ability of the country concern but the principle that each country should meet obligation admit of no difference and be of universal application be axiomatic that country can not stand still would seem to be perfectly plain from recent event that be determined to go forward but want no pretense want no vagary be determined to advance in an orderly sound and common sense way do not propose to abandon the theory of the declaration that the people have inalienable right which no majority and no power of government can destroy do not propose to abandon the practice of the constitution that provide for the protection of these right believe that within these limitation which be impose not by the fiat of man but by the law of the creator self government be just and wise be convince that will be impossible for the people to provide own government unless continue to own own property these be the very foundation of america on have be erect a government of freedom and equality of justice and mercy of education and charity live under and support the people have come into great possession on the material and spiritual side of life want to continue in this direction know that the congress share with that desire want institution to be more and more expressive of these principle want the people of all the earth to see in the american flag the symbol of a government which intend no oppression at home and no aggression abroad which in the spirit of a common brotherhood provide assistance in time of distress transcript since the close of the last congress the nation have lose president harding the world know kindness and humanity greatness and character have leave mark upon history have make justice more certain and peace more secure the surpass tribute pay to memory as be bear across the continent to rest at last at home reveal the place lie hold in the heart of the american people but this be not the occasion for extended reference to the man or work in this presence among these who know and love that be unnecessary but who be associate with could not resume together the function of office without pause for a moment and in memory reconsecrate to the service of country be go remain be duty under the inspiration of example to take up the burden which be permit to lay down and to develop and support the wise principle of government which represent foreign affairs for peace reign everywhere desire to perpetuate always by grant full justice to other and require of other full justice to country have cardinal principle to maintain in foreign policy be an american principle must be an american policy attend to own affair conserve own strength and protect the interest of own citizen but recognize thoroughly obligation to help other reserve to the decision of own judgment the time the place and the method realize the common bond of humanity know the inescapable law of service country have definitely refuse to adopt and ratify the covenant of have not feel warrant in assume the responsibility which member have assume be not propose any change in this policy neither be the senate the incident so far as be concern be close the league exist as a foreign agency hope will be helpful but the|united|states see no reason to limit own freedom and independence of action by join shall do well to recognize this basic fact in all national affair and govern accordingly world court foreign policy have always be guide by principle the one be the avoidance of permanent political alliance which would sacrifice proper independence the other be the peaceful settlement of controversy between nation by example and by treaty have advocate arbitration for nearly|25|year have be a member of the|hague|tribunal and have long seek the creation of a permanent world|court|of|justice be in full accord with both of these policy favor the establishment of such a court intend to include the whole world that is and have long be an american policy pende before the senate be a proposal that this government give support to the|permanent|court|of|international|justice which be a new and somewhat different plan this be not a partisan question should not assume an artificial importance the court be merely a convenient instrument of adjustment to which could go but to which could not be bring should be discuss with entire candor not by a political but by a judicial method without pressure and without prejudice partisanship have no place in foreign relation as wish to see a court establish and as the proposal present the only practical plan on which many nation have ever agree though may not meet every desire therefore commend to the favorable consideration of the senate with the propose reservation clearly indicate refusal to adhere to the|league|of|nations russia diplomatic relation lately so largely interrupted be now be resume but russia present notable difficulty have every desire to see that great people who be traditional friend restore to position among the nation of the earth have relieve pitiable destitution with an enormous charity government offer no objection to the carrying on of commerce by citizen with the people of russia government do not propose however to enter into relation with another regime which refuse to recognize the sanctity of international obligation do not propose to barter away for the privilege of trade any of the cherish right of humanity do not propose to make merchandise of any american principle these right and principle must go wherever the sanction of government go but while the favor of america be not for sale be willing to make very large concession for the purpose of rescue the people of russia already encourage evidence of return to the ancient way of society can be detect but more be need whenever there appear any disposition to compensate citizen who be despoil and to recognize that debt contract with government not by the czar but by the newly form republic|of|russia whenever the active spirit of enmity to institution be abate whenever there appear work mete for repentance country ought to be the first to go to the economic and moral rescue of russia have every desire to help and no desire to injure hope the time be near at hand when can act debt the current debt and interest due from foreign government exclusive of the british debt of be do not favor the cancellation of this debt but see no objection to adjust in accordance with the principle adopt for the british debt country would not wish to assume the role of an oppressive creditor but would maintain the principle that financial obligation between nation be likewise moral obligation which international faith and honor require should be discharge government have a liquidate claim against germany for the expense of the army of occupation of besides this the|mixed|claims|commission have before about|12,500 claim of american citizen aggregate about|$1,225,000,000 these claim have already be reduce by a recent decision but there be valid claim reach well toward thousand of citizen with credit due of hundreds|of|millions|of|dollar have no redress save in the action of government these be very substantial interest which be the duty of government to protect as good can that course propose to pursue be for these reason that have a direct interest in the economic recovery of europe be enlarge by desire for the stability of civilization and the welfare of humanity that be make sacrifice to that end none can deny deferred interest alone amount to a|million|dollars every day but recently offer to aid with advice and counsel have reiterate desire to see france pay and germany revive have propose disarmament have earnestly seek to compose difference and restore peace shall persevere in well do not by force but by reason foreign paper under the law the paper pertain to foreign relation to be print be transmit as a part of this message other volume of these paper will follow foreign service the foreign service of government need to be reorganize and improve fiscal condition main problem be domestic problem financial stability be the first requisite of sound government can not escape the effect of world condition can not avoid the inevitable result of the economic disorder which have reach all nation but shall diminish harm to in proportion as continue to restore government finance to a secure and endurable position this can and must do upon that firm foundation rest the only hope of progress and prosperity from that source must come relief for the people this be be accomplish by a drastic but orderly retrenchment which be bring expense within mean the origin of this have be the determination of the american people the main support have be the courage of those in authority and the effective method have be the result have involve real sacrifice by department head but have be make without flinch this system be a law of the congress represent will must be maintain and ought to be strengthen by the example of observance without a budget system there can be no fix responsibility and no constructive scientific economy this great concentration of effort by the administration and congress have bring the expenditure exclusive of the self support post office|department down to three|billion|dollars be possible in consequence to make a large reduction in the taxis of the people which be the sole object of all curtailment this be treat at great length in the budget message and a propose plan have be present in detail in a statement by the secretary of the treasury which have unqualified approval especially commend a decrease on earn income and further abolition of admission message and nuisance taxis tile amusement and educational value of move picture ought not to be tax diminish charge against moderate income from investment will afford immense relief while a revision of the surtax will not only provide additional money for capital investment thus stimulate industry and employ more but will not greatly reduce the revenue from that source and may in the future actually increase be oppose to war taxis in time of peace be not in favor of excess profit taxis a very great service could be render through immediate enactment of legislation relieve the people of some of the burden of taxation to reduce war taxis be to give every home a well chance for seven|year the people have bear with uncomplaine courage the tremendous burden of national and local taxation these must both be reduce the taxis of the nation must be reduce now as much as prudence will permit and expenditure must be reduce accordingly high taxis reach everywhere and burden everybody gear most heavily upon the poor diminish industry and commerce make agriculture unprofitable increase the rate on transportation be a charge on every necessary of life of all service which the congress can render to the country have no hesitation in declare to neglect to postpone to obstruct by unsound proposal be to become unworthy of public confidence and untrue to public trust the country want this measure to have the right of way over an other another reform which be urgent in fiscal system be the abolition of the right to issue tax exempt security the exist system not only permit a large amount of the wealth of the notion to escape just burden but act as a continual stimulant to municipal extravagance this should be prohibit by constitutional amendment all the wealth of the nation ought to contribute fair share to the expense of the nation tariff law the present tariff law have accomplish main object have secure an abundant revenue and be productive of an abound prosperity under the country have have a very large export and import trade a constant revision of the tariff by the congress be disturbing and harmful the present law contain an elastic provision authorize the president to increase or decrease present schedule not in excess of per centum to meet the difference in cost of production at home and abroad this do not to mind warrant a rewriting of the whole law but do mean and will be so administer that whenever the require investigation show that inequality of sufficient importance exist in any schedule the power to change should and will be apply shipping the entire well be of country be dependent upon transportation by sea and land government during the war acquire a large merchant fleet which should be transfer as soon as possible to private ownership and operation under condition which would secure result first and of prime importance adequate mean for national defense second adequate service to american commerce until shipping condition be such that fleet can be dispose of advantageously under these condition will be operate as economically as possible under such plan as may be devise from time to time by the|shipping|board must have a merchant marine which meet these requirement and shall have to pay the cost of service public improvement the time have come to resume in a moderate way the opening of intracoastal waterway the control of flood water of the mississippi and of the|colorado|river the improvement of the waterway from the|great|lake toward the|gulf|of|mexico and the development of the great power and navigation project of for which effort be now be make to secure the necessary treaty with canada these project can not all be undertake at once but all should have the immediate consideration of the congress and be adopt as fast as plan can be mature and the necessary fund become available this be not incompatible with economy for nature do not require so much a public expenditure as a capital investment which will be reproductive as evidence by the mark increase in revenue from the|panama|canal upon these project depend much future industrial and agricultural progress represent the protection of large area from flood and the addition of a great amount of cheap power and cheap freight by use of navigation chief of which be the bringing of ocean go ship to the|great|lake another problem of ally character be the superpower development of consideration of which be grow under the direction of the|department|of|commerce by joint conference with the local authority railroads criticism of the railroad law have be direct first to the section lay down the rule by which rate be fix and provide for payment to the government and use of excess earning to the method for the adjustment of wage scale and third to the authority permitting consolidation have be erroneously assume that the act undertake to guarantee railroad earning the law require that rate should be just and reasonable that have always be the rule under which rate have be fix to make a rate that do not yield a fair return result in confiscation and confiscatory rate be of course unconstitutional unless the government adhere to the rule of make a rate that will yield a fair return must abandon rate make altogether the new and important feature of that part of the law be the recapture and redistribution of excess rate the constitutionality of this method be now before the|supreme|court for adjudication decision should be await before attempt further legislation on this subject furthermore the importance of this feature will not be great if consolidation go into effect the settlement of railroad labor dispute be a matter of grave public concern be establish to protect the public in the enjoyment of continuous service by attempt to insure justice between the company and employee have be a great help but be not altogether satisfactory to the public the employee or the company if a substantial agreement can be reach among the group interested there should be no hesitation in enact such agreement into law if be not reach may very well be leave for the present to protect the public welfare the law for consolidation be not sufficiently effective to be expeditious additional legislation be need give authority for voluntary consolidation both regional and route and provide government machinery to aid and stimulate such action always subject to the approval of the|interstate|commerce|commission this should authorize the commission to appoint committee for each propose group represent the public and the component road with power to negotiate with individual security holder for an exchange of security for those of the consolidation on such term and condition as the commission may prescribe for avoid any confiscation and preserve fair value should this permissive consolidation prove ineffective after a limited period the authority of the government will have to be directly invoke consolidation appear to be the only feasible method for the maintenance of an adequate system of transportation with an opportunity so to adjust freight rate as to meet such temporary condition as now prevail in some agricultural section competent authority agree that an entire reorganization of the rate structure for freight be necessary this should be order at once by the congress department|of|justice as no revision of the law of the|united|state have be make since a commission or committee should be create to undertake this work the|judicial|council report that more district judge be need in the southern district of new|york in the northern district of georgia and more circuit judge in the|circuit|court|of|appeal of the|eighth|circuit legislation should be consider for this purpose be desirable to expedite the hearing and disposal of case a commission of federal judge and lawyer should be create to recommend legislation by which the procedure in the federal trial court may be simplify and regulate by rule of court rather than by statute such rule to be submit to the congress and to be in force until annul or modify by the congress the|supreme|court need legislation revise and simplify the law govern review by that court and enlarge the class of case of too little public importance to be subject to review such reform would expedite the transaction of the business of the court the administration of justice be likely to fail if be long delay the|national|government have never give adequate attention to prison problem ought to provide employment in such form of production as can be use by the government though not sell to the public in competition with private business for all prisoner who can be place at work and for which should receive a reasonable compensation available for dependent independent reformatory be need for the segregation of woman and another for the segregation of young man serve first sentence the administration of justice would be facilitate greatly by include in the|bureau|of|investigation|of|the|department|of|justice|a|division|of|criminal|identification where there would be collect this information which be now indispensable in the suppression of crime prohibition the prohibition amendment to the constitution require the congress and the president to provide adequate law to prevent violation be duty to enforce such law for that purpose a treaty be be negotiate with great|britain with respect to the ri light of search of hovering vessel to prevent smuggling the|coast|card should be greatly strengthen and a supply of swift power boat should be provide the major source of production should be rigidly regulate and every effort should be make to suppress interstate traffic with this action on the part of the|national|government and the cooperation which be usually render by municipal and state authority prohibition should be make effective free government have no great menace than disrespect for authority and continual violation of law be the duty of a citizen not only to observe the law but to let be know that be oppose to violation the negro number among population be some|12,000,000 colored people under constitution right be just as sacred as those of any other citizen be both a public and a private duty to protect those right the congress ought to exercise all power of prevention and punishment against the hideous crime of lynching of which the negro be by no means the sole sufferer but for which furnish a majority of the victim already a considerable sum be appropriate to give the negro vocational training in agriculture a dollar be recommend for medical course at howard|university to help contribute to the education of colored doctor need each|year on account of the integration of large number into industrial center have be propose that a commission be create compose of member from both race to formulate a well policy for mutual understanding and confidence such an effort be to be commend everyone would rejoice in the accomplishment of the result which seek but be well to recognize that these difficulty be to a large extent local problem which must be work out by the mutual forbearance and human kindness of each community such a method give much more promise of a real remedy than outside interference civil service the maintenance and extension of the classify civil service be exceedingly important there be nearly|550,000 person in the executive civil service draw about|$700,000,000 of yearly compensation fifth of these be in the classified service this method of selection of the employee of the|united|state be especially desirable for the|post|office|department the|civil|service|commission have recommend that postmaster at first second and third class office be classify such action accompany by a repeal of the year term of office would undoubtedly be an improvement also recommend that the field force for prohibition enforcement be bring within the classify civil service without cover in the present membership the good method for select public servant be the merit system public building many of the department in washington need well housing facility some

further legislation declare a general policy and delegate the authority to make rule and regulation to an administrative body army and navy for several|year have be decrease the personnel of the army and navy and reduce power to the danger point further reduction should not be make the army be a guarantee of the security of citizen at home the navy be a guarantee of the security of citizen abroad both of these service should be strengthen rather than weaken additional plane be need for the army and additional submarine for the navy the defense of panama must be perfect want no more competitive armament want no more war but want no weakness that invite imposition a people who neglect national defense be put in jeopardy national honor insular possession condition in the insular possession on the whole have be good business have be revive be be administer accord to law that effort have the full support of the administration such recommendation as may conic from people or government should have the most considerate attention education and welfare our|national|government be not do as much as legitimately can do to promote the welfare of the people enormous material wealth institution whole form of society can not be consider fully successful until benefit reach the merit of every individual this be not a suggestion that the government should or could assume for the people the inevitable burden of existence there be no method by which can either be relieve of the result of own folly or be guarantee a successful life there be an inescapable personal responsibility for the development of character of industry of thrift and of self control these do not come from the government but from the people but the government can and should always be expressive of steadfast determination always vigilant to maintain condition under which these virtue be most likely to develop and secure recognition and reward this be the american policy be in accordance with this principle that have enact law for the protection of the public health and have adopt prohibition in narcotic drug and intoxicate liquor for purpose of national uniformity ought to provide by constitutional amendment and appropriate legislation for a limitation of child labor and in all case under the exclusive jurisdiction of the|federal|government a minimum wage law for woman which would undoubtedly find sufficient power of enforcement in the influence of public opinion have in mind that education be peculiarly a local problem and that should always be pursue with the large freedom of choice by student and parent nevertheless the|federal|government may well give the benefit of counsel and encouragement more freely in this direction if anyone doubt the need of concert action by the|state of the nation for this purpose be only necessary to consider the appal figure of illiteracy represent a condition which do not vary much in all part of the union do not favor the making of appropriation from the|national|treasury to be expend directly on local education but do consider a fundamental requirement of national activity which accompany by allied subject of welfare be worthy of a separate department and a place in the cabinet the humanitarian side of government should not be repress but should be cultivate mere intelligence however be not enough enlightenment must be accompany by that moral power which be the product of the home and of rebellion real education and true welfare for the people rest inevitably on this foundation which the government can approve and commend but which the people must create immigration american institution rest solely on good citizenship be create by people who have a background of self government new arrival should be limit to capacity to absorb into the rank of good citizenship america must be keep american for this i purpose be necessary to continue a policy of restricted immigration would be well to make such immigration of a selective nature with some inspection at the source and base either on a prior census or upon the record of naturalization either method would insure the admission of those with the large capacity and good intention of become citizen be convinced that present economic and social condition warrant a limitation of those to be admit should find additional safety in a law require the immediate registration of all alien those who do not want to be partaker of the american spirit ought not to settle in america veterans no more important duty fall on the government of the|united|state than the adequate care of veteran those suffer disability incur in the service must have sufficient hospital relief and compensation dependent must be support rehabilitation and vocational training must be complete all of this service must be clean must be prompt and effective and must be administer in a spirit of the broad and deep human sympathy if investigation reveal any present defect of administration or need of legislation order will be give for the immediate correction of administration and recommendation for legislation should be give the high preference at present there be vacant bed in government hospital recommend that all hospital be authorize at once to receive and care for without hospital pay the veteran of all war need such care whenever there be vacant bed and that immediate step be take to enlarge and build new hospital to serve all such case the|american|legion will present to the congress a legislative gram too extensive for detailed discussion here be a carefully matured plan while some of do not favor with much of be in hearty accord and recommend that a most painstaking effort be make to provide remedy for any defect in the administration of the present law which experience have reveal the attitude of the government toward these proposal should be of generosity but do not favor the granting of a bonus coal the cost of coal have become unbearably high place a great burden on industrial and domestic life the public welfare require a reduction in the price of fuel with the enormous deposit in existence failure of supply ought not to be tolerate those responsible for the condition in this industry should undertake reform and free from any charge of profiteering the report of the|coal|commission will be before the congress comprise all the fact represent the mature deliberation and conclusion of the good talent and experience that ever make a national survey of the production and distribution of fuel do not favor government ownership or operation of coal mine the need be for action under private ownership that will secure great continuity of production and great public protection the|federal|government probably have no peacetime authority to regulate wage price or profit in coal at the mine or among dealer but by ascertaining and publishing fact can exercise great influence the source of the difficulty in the bituminous coal field be the intermittence of operation which cause great waste of both capital and labor that part of the report deal with this problem have much significance and be suggestive of necessary remedy by amend the car rule by encourage great unity of ownership and possibly by permit common selling agent for limited district on condition that accept adequate regulation and guarantee that competition between district be unlimited distribution storage and continuity ought to be improve the supply of coal must be constant in case of prospective interruption the president should have authority to appoint a commission empower to deal with whatever emergency situation may arise to aid conciliation and voluntary arbitration to adjust any exist or threaten controversy between the employer and the employee when collective bargaining fail and by control distribution to prevent profiteering in this vital necessity this legislation be exceedingly urgent and essential to the exercise of national authority for the protection of the people those who undertake the responsibility of management or employment in this industry do so with the full knowledge that the public interest be paramount and that to fail through any motive of selfishness in service be such a betrayal of duty as warrant uncompromise action by the government reorganization a special joint committee have be appoint to work out a plan for a reorganization of the different department and bureaus of the government more scientific and economical than the present system with the exception of the consolidation of the|war|and navy departments and some minor detail the plan have the general sanction of the president and the cabinet be important that reorganization be enact into law at the present session agriculture aid by the sound principle adopt by the government the business of the country have have an extraordinary revival look at as a whole the nation be in the enjoyment of remarkable prosperity industry and commerce be thrive for the most tart agriculture be successful staple have rise in value from about|$5,300,000,000 two|years|ago to about for the|current|year but range cattle be still low in price and some section of the wheat area notably minnesota and on west have many case of actual distress with product not sell on a parity with the product of industry every sound remedy that can be devise should be apply for the relief of the farmer represent a character a type of citizenship and a public necessity that must be preserve and afford every facility for regain prosperity the distress be most acute among those wholly dependent upon crop wheat acreage be greatly expand and have not yet be sufficiently reduce a large amount be raise for export which have to meet the competition in the world market of large amount raise on land much cheap and much more productive no complicated scheme of relief no plan for government fix of price no resort to the public treasury will be of any permanent value in establish agriculture simple and direct method put into operation by the farmer be the only real source for restoration indirectly the farmer must be relieve by a reduction of national and local taxation must be assist by the reorganization of the freight rate structure which could reduce charge on production to make this fully effective there ought to be railroad consolidation cheap fertilizer must be provide must have organization customer with whom exchange product farm for those of industry be organize labor be organize business be organize and there be no way for agriculture to meet this unless too be organize the acreage of wheat be too large unless can meet the world market at a profit must stop raise for export organization would help to reduce acreage system of cooperative marketing create by the farmer supervise by competent management without doubt would be of assistance but the can not wholly solve the problem agricultural school ought to have thorough course in the theory of organization and cooperative marketing diversification be necessary those farmer who raise living on land be not greatly in distress such loan as be wisely need to assist buy stock and other material to start in this direction should be finance through a government agency as a temporary and emergency expedient the remain difficulty be the disposition of exportable wheat do not favor the permanent interference of the government in this problem that probably would increase the trouble by increase production but seem feasible to provide government assistance to export and authority should be give the|war|finance|corporation to grant in discretion the most liberal term of payment for fat and grain export for the direct benefit of the farm muscle shoal the government be undertake to develop a great water power project know as muscle|shoal on which have expend many|million|dollar the work be still go on subject to the right to retake in time of war recommend that this property with a location for auxiliary steam plant and right of way be sell this would end the present burden of expense and should return to the treasury the large price possible to secure while the price be an important element there be another consideration even more compelling the agriculture of the nation need a great supply and low cost of fertilizer this be now import in large quantity the good information can secure indicate that present method of power production would not be able profitably to meet the price at which these import can be sell to obtain a supply from this water power would require long and costly experimentation to perfect a process for cheap production otherwise purpose would fail completely seem desirable therefore in order to protect and promote the public welfare to have adequate covenant that such experimentation be make and carry on to success the great advantage of low price nitrate must be secure for the direct benefit of the farmer and the indirect benefit of the public in time of peace and of the government in time of war if this main object be accomplish the amount of money receive for the property be not a primary or major consideration such a solution will involve complicated negotiation and there be no authority for that purpose therefore recommend that the congress appoint a small joint committee to consider offer conduct negotiation and report definite recommendation reclamation by reason of many contributing cause occupant of reclamation project be in financial difficulty which in some case be acute relief should be grant by definite authority of law empower the secretary of the interior in discretion to suspend readjust and reassess all charge against water user this whole question be be consider by expert will have the advantage of the fact and conclusion which may develop this situation involve a government investment of and affect more|than|30,000 water user be serious while relief which be necessary should be grant yet contract with the government which can be meet should be meet the establish general policy of these project should not be abandon for any private control highway and forest highway and reforestation should continue to have the interest and support of the government everyone be anxious for good highway have make a liberal proposal in the budget for the continue payment to the states by the|federal|government of share for this necessary public improvement no expenditure of public money contribute so much to the national wealth as for build good road reforestation have an importance far above the attention usually secure a special committee of the senate be investigate this need and shall welcome a constructive policy base on report be since country announce the monroe doctrine this principle have be ever since and be now of the main foundation of foreign relation must be maintain but in maintain must not be forgetful that a great change have take place be no longer a weak nation think mainly of defense dread foreign imposition be great and powerful new power bring new responsibility ditty then be to protect add to that duty now be to help give stability to the world want idealism want that vision which lift man and nation above these be virtue by reason of own merit but must not be cloister must not be impractical must not be ineffective the world have have enough of the curse of hatred and selfishness of destruction and war have have enough of the wrongful use of material power for the healing of the nation there must be good will and charity confidence and peace the time have come for a more practical use of moral power and more reliance upon the principle that right make own might authority among the nation must be represent by justice and mercy be necessary not only to have faith but to make sacrifice for faith the spiritual force of the world make all final determination be with these voice that america should speak whenever declare a righteous purpose there need be no doubt that will be hear america have take place in the world as a republic free independent powerful the good service that can be render to humanity be the assurance that this place will be maintain transcript member of the congres so many problem be call for solution that a recital of all of in the face of the know limitation of a short session of congress would seem to lack sincerity of purpose be four|year since the|world|war end but the inevitable readjustment of the social and economic order be not more than barely begin there be no acceptance of pre - war condition anywhere in the world in a very general way humanity harbor individual wish to go on with war time compensation for production with pre - war requirement in expenditure in short everyone speak broadly crave readjustment for everybody except while there can be no just and permanent readjustment except when all participate the civilization which measure strength of genius and the power of science and the resource of industry in addition to test the limit of man power and the endurance and heroism of man and woman that same civilization be bring to severest test in restore a tranquil order and commit humanity to the stable way of peace if the sober and deliberate appraisal of pre - war civilization make seem a worth while inheritance then with patience and good courage will be preserve there never again will be precisely the old order indeed know of no one who think to be desirable for out of the old order come the war and the new order establish and make secure never will permit recurrence be no figure of speech to say have come to the test of civilization the world have be pass be today pass through of a great crisis the conduct of war be not more difficult than the solution of the problem which necessarily follow be not speak at this moment of the problem in wide aspect of world rehabilitation or of international relationship the reference be to own social financial and economic problem at home these thing be not to be consider solely as problem apart from all international relationship but every nation must be able to carry on for else international relationship will have scant importance doubtless own people have emerge from the world|war tumult less impaired than most belligerent power probably have make large progress toward reconstruction surely have be fortunate in diminish unemployment and industrial and business activity which be the lifeblood of material existence have be restore as in no other reconstruction period of like length in the history of the world have escape the coal and railway strike which have no excuse for beginning and less justification for delay settlement should have do infinitely well but labor be insistent on hold to the war height and heedless force of reaction seek the pre - war level and both be wrong in the folly of conflict progress be hinder and the heavy cost have not yet be fully estimate there can be neither adjustment nor the penalty of the failure to readjust in which all do not somehow participate the railway strike accentuate the difficulty of the american farmer the first distress of readjustment come to the farmer and will not lie a readjustment fit to abide until be relieve the distress bring to the farmer do not affect alone agricultural ill fortune be a national ill fortune that fourth of population which produce the food of the republic and add so largely to export commerce must participate in the good fortune of the nation else there be none worth retain agriculture be a vital activity in national life in have beginning and westward march with the star of the empire have reflect the growth of the republic have vicissitude which no legislation will prevent hardship for which no law can provide escape but the congress can make available to the farmer the financial facility which have be build up under government aid and supervision for other commercial and industrial enterprise may be do on the same solid fundamental and make the vitally important agricultural industry more secure and must be do this congress already have take cognizance of the misfortune which precipitate deflation bring to american agriculture measure of relief and the reduction of the federal reserve discount rate undoubtedly save the country from widespread disaster the very proof of helpfulness already give be the strong argument for the permanent establishment of widened credit heretofore temporarily extend through the|war|finance|corporation the|farm|loan|bureau which already have prove usefulness through the federal land bank may well have power enlarge to provide ample farm production credit as well as enlarged land credit be entirely practical to create a division in the federal land bank to deal with production credit with the limitation of time so adjust to the farm turnover as the federal reserve system provide for the turnover in the manufacturing and mercantile world special provision must be make for live stock production credit and the limit of land loan may be safely enlarge various measure be pende before and the good judgment of congress ought to be express in a prompt enactment at the present session but american agriculture need more than add credit facility the credit will help to solve the press problem grow out of war inflate land value and the drastic deflation of but permanent and deserve agricultural good fortune depend on well and cheap transportation here be an outstanding problem demand the most rigorous consideration of the congress and the country have to do with more than agriculture provide the channel for the flow of the country 's commerce but the farmer be particularly hard hit market so affect by the world consumption do not admit of the price adjustment to meet carrying charge in the|last|half|of|the|year now close the railway break in carry capacity because of motive power and roll stock out of order though insistently declare to the contrary embargo shipment or deny car when fortunate market be call too frequently transportation fail while perishable product be turn from possible profit to loss count in tens|of|million know of no problem exceed in importance this of transportation in complex and interdependent modern life transportation be essential to very existence let pass for the moment the menace in the possible paralysis of such service as have and note the failure for whatever reason to expand transportation to meet the nation 's need the census of record a population of in two|decade more may reasonably expect to count thrice that number in the|three|decades|ending|in|1920 the country 's freight by rail increase from 631,000,000|tons|to 2,234,000,000|ton that be to say while population be increase less than per cent the freight movement increase over per cent have build of the world 's railroad mileage and yet find inadequate to present requirement when contemplate the inadequacy of to day be easy to believe that the|next|few|decad will witness the paralysis of transportation use social scheme or a complete reorganization on some new basis mindful of the tremendous cost of betterment extension and expansion and mindful of the staggering debt of the world to day the difficulty be magnify here be a problem demand wide vision and the avoidance of mere makeshift no matter what the error of the past no matter how acclaim construction and then condemn operation in the past have the transportation and the honest investment in the transportation which speed on to what be and face condition which reflect inadequacy to day great inadequacy to morrow and contemplate transportation cost which much of the traffic can not and will not continue to pay manifestly have need to begin on plan to coordinate all transportation facility should more effectively connect up rail line with carrier by sea ought to reap some benefit from the|hundreds|of|million expend on inland waterway prove capacity to utilize as well as expend ought to turn the motor truck into a railway feeder and distributor instead of a destroy competitor would be folly to ignore that live in a motor age the motor car reflect standard of living and gauge the speed of present day life long ago run down simple|living and never halt to inquire about the prostrate figure which fall as victim with full recognition of motor car transportation must turn to the most practical use can not supersede the railway line no matter how generously afford highway out of the|public|treasury if freight traffic by motor be charge with proper and proportionate share of highway construction should find much of wasteful and more costly than like service by rail yet have parallel the railway a most natural line of construction and thereby take away from the agency of expect service much of profitable traffic which the taxpayer have be provide the highway whose cost of maintenance be not yet realize the|federal|government have a right to inquire into the wisdom of this policy because the|national|treasury be contribute largely to this highway construction costly highway ought to be make to serve as feeder rather than competitor of the railroad and the motor truck should become a coordinate factor in great distributing system this transportation problem can not be waive aside the demand for lower cost on farm product and basic material can not be ignore rate horizontally increase to meet increased wage outlay during the war inflation be not easily reduce when some very moderate wage reduction be effect last|summer there be a horizontal reduction in rate seek at that time in a very informal way to have the railway manager go before the|interstate|commerce|commission and agree to a heavy reduction on farm product and coal and other basic commodity and leave unchanged the freight tariff which a very large portion of the traffic be able to bear neither the manager nor the commission tile suggestion so have the horizontal reduction see fit to adopt too slight to be feel by the high class cargo and too little to benefit the heavy tonnage call most loudly for relief railway be not to be expect to render the most essential service in social organization without a fair return on capital invest but the government have go so far in the regulation of rate and rule of operation that have the responsibility of point the way to the reduced freight cost so essential to national welfare government operation do not afford the cure be government operation which bring to the very order of thing against which now rebel and be still liquidate the cost of that supreme folly surely the genius of the railway builder have not become extinct among the railway manager new economy new efficiency in cooperation must be find the fact that labor take per cent of total railway earning make limitation within which to effect economy very difficult but the demand be no less insistent on that account clearly the manager be without that intercarri cooperative relationship so highly essential to the good and most economical operation could not function in harmony when the strike threaten the paralysis of all railway transportation the relationship of rail service to public welfare so intimately affect by state and federal regulation demand the effective correlation and a concert drive to meet an insistent and justified public demand the merger of line into system a facilitate interchange of freight car the economic use of terminal and the consolidation of facility be suggest way of economy and efficiency remind that congress provide a|joint|commission|of|agricultural|inquiry which make an exhaustive investigation of car service and transportation and unanimously recommend in report of october|15,|1921 the pooling of freight car under a central agency this report well deserve serious consideration think well of the central agency which shall be a creation of the railway to provide under the jurisdiction of the|interstate|commerce|commission the mean for financing equipment for carrier which be otherwise unable to provide proportion of car equipment adequate to transportation need this same agency ought to point the way to every possible economy in maintained equipment and the necessary interchange in railway commerce in a previous address to the congress call to attention the insufficiency of power to enforce the decision of the|railroad|labor|board carrier have ignore decision on the hand railway workman have challenge decision by a strike on the other hand the intent of congress to establish a tribunal to which railway labor and manager may appeal respect question of wage and working condition can not be too strongly commend be vitally important that some such agency should be a guaranty against suspend operation the public must be spare even the threat of discontinue service sponsor the railroad as do be an obligation that labor shall be assure the high justice and every proper consideration of wage and working condition but be an equal obligation to see that no concerted action in force demand shall deprive the public of the transportation service essential to very existence be now impossible to safeguard public interest because the decree of the board be unenforceable against either employer or employee the|labor|board be not so constitute as best to serve the public interest with partisan member on a board of partisan nominate by the employee and by the railway manager be inevitable that the partisan viewpoint be maintain throughout hearing and in decision hand down indeed the few exception to a strictly partisan expression in decision thus far render have be follow by accusation of betrayal of the partisan interest represent only the public group of be free to function in unbiased decision therefore the partisan membership may well be abolish and decision should be make by an impartial tribunal be well convinced that the function of this tribunal could be much better carry on here in washington even be to be continue as a separate tribunal there ought to be contact with the|interstate|commerce|commission which have supreme authority in the rate make to which wage cost bear an indissoluble relationship theoretically a fair and living wage must be determine quite apart from the employer 's earning capacity but in practice in the railway service be inseparable the record of advanced rate to meet increased wage both determine by the government be proof enough the substitution of a labor division in the|interstate|commerce|commission make up from membership to hear and decide dispute relate to wage and work condition which have fail of adjustment by proper committee create by the railway and employee offer a more effective plan nee not be surprising that there be dissatisfaction over delay hearing and decision by the present board when every trivial dispute be carry to that tribunal the law should require the railroad and employee to institute mean and method to negotiate between constantly arise difference limit appeal to the government tribunal to dispute of such character as be likely to affect the public welfare this suggest substitution will involve a necessary increase in the membership of the commission probably to constitute the labor division if the suggestion appeal to the congress will be well to specify that the labor division shall be constitute of representative of the rate make territory thereby assure a tribunal conversant with the condition which obtain in the different ratemaking section of the country wish could bring to the precise recommendation for the prevention of strike which threaten the welfare of the people and menace public safety be an impotent civilization and an inadequate government which lack the genius and the courage to guard against such a menace to public welfare as experience last|summer be aware of the government 's great concern and futile attempt to aid in an adjustment will reveal the inexcusable obstinacy which be responsible for so much distress to the country to recall now that though all dispute be not yet adjust the many settlement which have be make be on the term which the government propose in mediation public interest demand that ample power shall be confer upon the labor tribunal whether be the present board or the suggest substitute to require ruling to be accept by both party to a dispute question let there be no confusion about the purpose of the suggest conferment of power to make decision effective there can be no denial of constitutional right of either railway workman or railway manager no man can be deny right to labor when and how choose or cease to labor when so elect but since the government assume to safeguard interest while employ in an essential public service the security of society demand retirement from the service shall not be so timed and relate as to effect the destruction of that service this vitally essential public transportation service demand so much of brain and brawn so much for efficiency and security ought to offer the most attractive working condition and the high of wage pay to workman in any employment in essentially every branch from track repairer to the man at the locomotive throttle the railroad worker be responsible for the safety of human life and the care of vast property high responsibility may well rate high pay within the limit the traffic will bear but the same responsibility plus grovernmental protection may justly deny and associate a withdrawal from service without a warning or under circumstance which involve the paralysis of necessary transportation have assume so great a responsibility in necessary regulation that unconsciously have assume the responsibility for maintained service therefore the lawful power for the enforcement of decision be necessary to sustain the majesty of government and to administer to the public welfare during long session the present congress enact a new tariff law the protection of the american standard of live demand the insurance provide against the distorted condition of world commerce the framer of the law make provision for a certain flexibility of custom duty whereby be possible to readjust as develop condition may require the enactment have impose a large responsibility upon the executive but that responsibility will be discharge with a broad mindfulness of the whole business situation the provision admit either the possible fallibility of rate or unsuitableness to change condition believe the grant of authority may be promptly and discreetly exercise ever mindful of the intent and purpose to safeguard american industrial activity and at the same time prevent the exploitation of the american consumer and keep open the path of such liberal exchange as do not endanger own productivity no one contemplate commercial aloofness nor any other aloofness contradictory to the good american tradition or lofty human purpose fortunate capacity for comparative self containment afford the firm foundation on which to build for own security and a like foundation on which to build for a future of influence and importance in world commerce trade expansion must come of capacity and of policy of righteousness and reasonableness in till commercial relation let no one assume that provision for maintain good fortune at home and unwillingness to assume the correction of all the ill of the world mean a reluctance to cooperate with other people or to assume every just obligation to promote human advancement anywhere in the world war make a creditor nation do not seek an excess possession of the world 's gold and have neither desire to profit unduly by possession nor permanently retain do not seek to become an international dictator because of power the voice of the|united|state have a respectful hearing in international council because have convince the world that have no selfish end to serve no old grievance to avenge no territorial or other greed to satisfy but the voice be hear be that of good counsel not of dictation be the voice of sympathy and fraternity and helpfulness seek to assist but not assume for the|united|states burden which nation must bear for would rejoice to help rehabilitate currency system and facilitate all commerce which do not drag to the very level of those seek to lift up while have everlasting faith in republic would be folly indeed to blind to problem at home abuse the hospitality of shore be the advocate of revolution find delude follower among those who take on the habiliment of an american without know an american soul there be the recrudescence of hyphenate americanism which think to have be stamp out when commit the nation life and soul to the|world|war there be a call to make the alien respect institution while accept hospitality there be need to magnify the american viewpoint to the alien who seek a citizenship among there be need to magnify the national viewpoint to americans throughout the land more there be a demand for every living be in the|united|state to respect and abide by the law of the republic let man who be rend the moral fiber of the republic through easy contempt for the prohibition law because think restrict personal liberty remember that set the example and breed a contempt for law which will ultimately destroy the republic constitutional prohibition have be adopt by the nation be the supreme law of the land in plain speaking there be condition relate to enforcement which savor of nation wide scandal be the most demoralizing factor in public life most of people assume that the adoption of the eighteenth amendment mean the elimination of the question from politic on the contrary have be so intensify as an issue that many voter be dispose to make all political decision with reference to this single question be distract the public mind and prejudice the judgment of the electorate the|day be unlikely to come when the eighteenth amendment will be repeal the fact may as well be recognize and course adapt accordingly if the statutory provision for enforcement be contrary to deliberate public opinion which do not believe the rigorous and literal enforcement will concentrate public attention on any requisite modification such a course conform with the law and save the humiliation of the government and the humiliation of people before the world and challenge the destructive force engage in widespread violation official corruption and individual demoralization the eighteenth amendment involve the concurrent authority of state and federal|governments for the enforcement of the policy define a certain lack of definiteness through division of responsibility be thus introduce in order to bring about a full understanding of duty and responsibility as thus distribute purpose to invite the governor of the|state and territories at an early opportunity to a conference with the federal|executive authority out of the full and free consideration which will thus be possible be confidently believe will emerge a more adequate comprehension of the whole problem and definite policy of national and state cooperation in administer the law there be pende bill for the registration of the alien who have come to shore wish the passage of such an act may be expedite life amid american opportunity be worth the cost of registration if be worth the seeking and the nation have the right to know who be citizen in the making or who live among and share advantage while seek to undermine cherish institution this provision will enable to guard against the abuse in immigration check the undesirable whose irregular willing be first violation of law more will facilitate the need americanizing of those who mean to enroll as fellow citizen before enlarge the immigration quota have well provide registration for alien those now here or continually press for admission and establish examination board abroad to make sure of desirable only by the examination abroad could end the pathos at port when man and woman find door close after long voyage and waste saving because be unfit for admission would be kindly and safe to tell before embark program of admission and treatment of immigrant be very intimately relate to the educational policy of the republic with illiteracy estimate at from tenth of to less|than|2|percent in of the foremost nation of europe rivet attention to serious problem when be remind of a illiteracy in the|united|state the figure be base on the test which define an illiterate as have no schoollng whatever remember the wide freedom of public school with compulsory attendance in many states in the union be convince that much of excessive illiteracy come to from abroad and the education of the immigrant become requisite to americanization must be do if be fittingly to exercise the duty as well as enjoy the privilege of american citizenship here be reveal the special field for federal cooperation in furthering education from the very begin public education have be leave mainly in the hand of the states so far as school youth be concern the policy have be justify because no responsibility can be so effective as that of the local community alive to task believe in the cooperation of the national authority to stimulate encourage and broaden the work of tile local authority but be the especial obligation of the|federal|government to devise mean and effectively assist in the education of the newcomer from foreign land so that the level of american education may be make the high that be humanly possible closely related to this problem of education be the abolition of child labor twice congress have attempt the correction of the evil incident to child employment the decision of the|supreme|court have put this problem outside the proper domain of federal regulation until the constitution be so amend as to give the congress indubitable authority recommend the submission of such an amendment have school of thought relate to amendment of the constitution nee not be commit to the belief that amendment be weaken the fundamental law or that excessive amendment be essential to meet every ephemeral whim ought to amend to meet the demand of the people when sanction by deliberate public opinion one|year|ago suggest the submission of an amendment so that may lawfully restrict the issue of tax exempt security and renew that recommendation now tax exempt security be dry up the source of federal taxation and be encourage unproductive and extravagant expenditure by state and municipality there be more than the menace in mount public debt there be the dissipation of capital which should be make available to the need of productive industry the propose amendment will place the state and federal|government and all political subdivision on an exact equality and will correct the grow menace of public borrowing which if leave unchecked may soon threaten the stability of institution be so vast and so varied in national interest that score of problem be press for attention must not risk the wearying of patience with detailed reference reclamation and irrigation project where waste land may be make available for settlement and productivity be worthy of favorable consideration when be realize that be consume timber time as rapidly as be grow must encourage the great possible cooperation between the|federal|government the various states and the owner of forest land to the end that protection from fire shall be make more effective and replant encourage the fuel problem be under study now by a very capable fact find commission and any attempt to deal with the coal problem of such deep concern to the entire nation must await the report of the commission there be necessary study of great problem which congress may well initiate the wide spread between production cost and price which consumer pay concern every citizen of the republic contribute very largely to the unrest in agriculture and must stand sponsor for much against which inveigh in that familiar term the high cost of living no one doubt the excess be traceable to the levy of the middleman but would be unfair to charge with all responsibility before appraise what be exact of by modernly complex life have attack the problem on side by the promotion of cooperative marketing and may well inquire into the benefit of cooperative buying admittedly the consumer be much to blame because of prodigal expenditure and exaction of service but government may well serve to point the way of narrow the spread of price especially between the production of food and consumption a superpower survey of the eastern industrial region have recently be complete look to unification of steam water and electric power and to a unified scheme of power distribution the survey prove that vast economy in tonnage movement of freight and in the efficiency of the railroad would be effect if the superpower program be adopt be convinced that constructive measure calculate to promote such an industrial development be tempt to say such an industrial revolution would be well worthy the careful attention and foster interest of the propose survey of a plan to draft all the resource of the republic human and material for national defense may well have approval commend such a program in case of future war in the inaugural address of march|4,|1921 and every experience in the adjustment and liquidation of war claim and the settlement of war obligation persuade ought to be prepare for such universal call to armed defense bring no apprehension of war the world be abhorrent of and own relation be not only free from every threatening cloud but have contribute large influence toward make armed conflict less likely those who assume that play part in the|world|war and later take aloof and apart unmindful of world obligation give scant credit to the helpful part assume in international relationship whether all nation signatory ratify all the treaty grow out of the|washington|conference|on|limitation|of|armament or some withhold approval the underlie policy of limit naval armament have the sanction of the large naval power and naval competition be suspend of course unanimous ratification be much to be desire the power pact which abolish every probability of war on the pacific have bring new confidence in a maintained peace and can well believe may be make a model for like assurance wherever in the world any common interest be concern have have express the hostility of the american people to a supergovernment or to any commitment where either a council or an assembly of league power may chart course treaty of armed alliance can have no likelihood of american sanction but believe in respect the right of nation in the value of conference and consultation in the effectiveness of leader of nation look each other in the face before resort to the arbitrament of arm have be fortune both to preach and promote international understanding the influence of the|united|state in bring near the settlement of an ancient dispute between south|american nation be add proof of the glow of peace in ample understanding in washington to day be meet the delegate of the central|american nation gather at the table of international understanding to stabilize republics and remove every vestige of disagreement be meet here by invitation not in aloofness and accept hospitality because have faith in unselfishness and believe in helpfulness perhaps be selfish in crave confidence and friendship but such a selfishness proclaim to the world regardless of hemisphere or sea divide would like the congress and the people of the nation to believe that in a firm and considerate way be insistent on american right wherever may be question and deny no right of other in the assertion of own moreover be cognizant of the world 's struggle for full readjustment and rehabilitation and have shirk no duty which come of sympathy or fraternity or high fellowship among nation every obligation consonant with american ideal and sanction under form of government be willingly meet when can not support do not demand constitutional limitation do not forbid the exercise of a moral influence the measure of which be not less than the high purpose have seek to serve after all there be less difference about the part this great republic shall play in further peace and advance humanity than in the manner of play ask no one to assume responsibility for assume no responsibility which other must bear for unless nationality be hopelessly swallow up in internationalism transcript be a very gratifying privilege to come to the congress with the republic at peace with all the nation of the world more be equally gratify to report that country be not only free from every impending menace of war but there be grow assurance of the permanency of the peace which so deeply cherish for approximately|ten|year have dwelt amid menace of war or as participant in war 's actuality and the inevitable aftermath with disordered condition bit add to the difficulty of government which adequately can not be appraise except by those who be in immediate contact and know the responsibility task would be less difficult if have only to consider but so much of the world be involve the disordered condition be so well nigh universal even among nation not engage in actual warfare that no permanent readjustment can be effect without consideration of inescapable relationship to world affair in finance and trade indeed should be unworthy of good tradition if be unmindful of social moral and political condition which be not of direct concern to but which do appeal to the human sympathy and the very become interest of a people bl with national good fortune be not purpose to bring to a program of world restoration in the main such a program must be work out by the nation more directly concerned must turn to the heroic remedy for the menacing condition under which be struggle then can help and mean to help shall do so unselfishly because there be compensation in the consciousness of assisting selfishly because the commerce and international exchange in trade which mark high tide of fortunate advancement be possible only when the nation of all continent be restore to stable order and normal relationship in the main the contribution of this republic to restore normalcy in the world must come through the initiative of the executive branch of the government but the good of intention and most carefully consider purpose would fail utterly if the sanction and the cooperation of congress be not cheerfully accord be very sure shall have no conflict of opinion about constitutional duty or authority during the anxiety of war when necessity seem compelling there be excessive grant of authority and all extraordinary concentration of power in the chief executive the repeal of war time legislation and the automatic expiration which attend the peace proclamation have put an end to these emergency excess but have the wish to go further than that want to join in restore in the most cordial way the spirit of coordination and cooperation and that mutuality of confidence and respect which be necessary ill representative popular government encroachment upon the function of congress or attempt dictation of policy be not to be think of much less attempt but there be all insistent call for harmony of purpose and concord of action to speed the solution of the difficult problem confront both the legislative and executive branch of the government be worth while to make allusion here to the character of government mindful as one must be that an address to be no less a message to all people for whom speak most intimately be popular government through political party divide along political line and would ever have so do not mean that partisan preference should hinder any public servant in the performance of a conscientious and patriotic official duty see partisan line utterly obliterate when war imperil and faith in the republic be rivet anew ought not to find these partisan line obstruct the expeditious solution of the urgent problem of peace grant that be fundamentally a representative popular government with political party the govern agency believe the political party in power should assume responsibility determine upon policy ill the conference which supplement convention and election campaign and then strive for achievement through adherence to the accept policy there be vastly great security immensely more of the national viewpoint much large and prompter accomplishment where division be along party line in the broad and loftier sense than to divide geographically or accord to pursuit or personal following for a|century and a third party have be charge with responsibility and hold to strict accounting when fail be relieve of authority and the system have bring to a national eminence no less than a world example necessarily legislation be a matter of compromise the full ideal be seldom attain in that meeting of mind necessary to insure result there must and will be accommodation and compromise but in the estimate of conviction and sincere purpose the supreme responsibility to national interest must not be ignore the shield to the high minded public servant who adhere to party policy be manifest but the high purpose be the good of the republic as a whole would be ungracious to withhold acknowledgment of the really large volume and excellent quality of work accomplish by the extraordinary session of congress which so recently adjourn be not unmindful of the very difficult task with which be call to deal and no one can ignore the insistent condition which during recent|years have call for the continue and almost exclusive attention of membership to public work would suggest insincerity if express complete accord with every expression record in roll call but be all agree about the difficulty and the inevitable divergence of opinion in seek the reduction amelioration and readjustment of the burden of taxation later on when other problem be solve shall make some recommendation about renew consideration of tax program but for the immediate time before must be content with the billion|dollar reduction in the tax draft upon the people and diminish irritation banish uncertainty and improved method of collection by sustainment of the rigid economy already inaugurate with hope for extension of these economy and add efficiency in administration believe further reduction may be enact and hinder burden abolish in these urgent economy shall be immensely assist by the budget system for which make provision in the extraordinary session the first budget be before preparation be a signal achievement and the perfection of the system a thing impossible in the|few|month available for initial trial will mark enactment as the beginning of the great reformation in governmental practice since the beginning of the republic there be pende a grant of authority to the administrative branch of the government for the funding and settlement of vast foreign loan grow out of grant of war credit with the hand of the executive branch hold impotent to deal with these debt be hinder urgent readjustment among debtor and accomplish nothing for think be fair for the congress to assume that the executive branch of the government would adopt no major policy in deal with these matter which would conflict with the purpose of congress in authorize the loan certainly not without ask congressional approval but there be minor problem incident to prudent loan transaction and the safeguarding of interest which can not even be attempt without this authorization will be helpful to and will improve condition among debtor if funding and the settlement of defaulted interest may be negotiate the previous congress deeply concerned in behalf of merchant marine in enact the exist shipping law design for the upbuilding of the american merchant marine among other thing provide to encourage shipping on the world 's sea the executive be direct to give notice of the termination of all exist commercial treaty in order to admit of reduced duty on import carry in american bottom during the life of the act no executive have comply with this order of the congress when the present administration come into responsibility begin an early inquiry into the failure to execute the express purpose of the|jones|act only conclusion have be possible frankly members of house and senate eager as be to join in the making of an american merchant marine commensurate with commerce the denouncement of out commercial treaty would involve in a chaos of trade relationship and add indescribably to the confusion of the already disorder commercial world power to do so be not dispute but power and ship without comity of relationship will not give the expand trade which be inseparably link with a great merchant marine moreover the apply reduction of duty for which the treaty denouncement be necessary encourage only the carrying of dutiable import to shore while the tonnage which unfurl the flag on the sea be both free and dutiable and the cargo which make nation eminent in trade be outgoing rather than incoming be not thought to lay the problem before in detail today be desire only to say to that the executive branch of the government uninfluence by the protest of any nation for none have be make be well convinced that proposal highly intend and heartily support here be so fraught with difficulty and so mark by tendency to discourage trade expansion that invite tolerance of noncompliance for only|a|few|week until a plan may be present which contemplate no great draft upon the|public|treasury and which though yet too crude to offer to day give such promise of expand merchant marine that will argue own approval be enough to say to day that be so possessed of ship and the american intention to establish merchant marine be so unalterable that a plain of reimbursement at no other cost than be contemplate in the exist act will appeal to the pride and encourage the hope of all the american people there be before the completion of the enactment of what have be term a permanent tariff law the word permanent be use to distinguish from the emergency act which the congress expedite early in the extraordinary session and which be the law today can not too strongly urge in early completion of this necessary legislation be need to stabilize industry at home be essential to make more definite trade relation abroad more be vital to the preservation of many of own industry which contribute so notably to the very lifeblood of nation there be now and there always will be a storm of conflict opinion about any tariff revision can not go far wrong when base tariff on the policy of preserve the productive activity which enhance employment and add to national prosperity again come the reminder that must not be unmindful of world condition that people be struggle for industrial rehabilitation and that can not dwell in industrial and commercial exclusion and at the same time do the just thing in aid world reconstruction and readjustment do not seek a selfish aloofness and could not profit by be possible recognize the necessity of buy wherever sell and the permanency of trade lie in acceptable exchange in pursuit of market must give as well as receive can not sell to other who do not produce nor can buy unless produce at home sensible of every obligation of humanity commerce and finance link as be in the present world condition be not to be argue that need destroy to be helpful to other with all heart wish restoration to the people blight by the awful world|war but the process of restoration do not lie in acceptance of like condition be well to remain on firm ground strive for ample employment and high standard of wage at home and point the way to balanced budget rigid economy and resolute efficient work as the necessary remedy to cure disaster everything relate to trade among and among nation have be expand excessive inflated abnormal and there be a madness in finance which no american policy alone will cure be a creditor nation not by normal process but make so by war be not an unworthy selfishness to seek to save when the process of that salvation be not only not deny to other but commend to seek to undermine for other no industry by which subsist be obligate to permit the undermining of none of own which make for employment and maintained activity every contemplation little matter in which direction turn magnify the difficulty of tariff legislation but the necessity of the revision be magnify with doubtless be justified in seek more flexible policy than have provide heretofore hope a way will be find to make for flexibility and elasticity so that rate may be adjust to meet unusual and change condition which can not be accurately anticipate there be problem incident to unfair practice and to exchange which madness in money have make almost unsolvable know of no manner in which to effect this flexibility other than the extension of the power of the|tariff|commission so that can adapt to scientific and wholly just administration of the law be not unmindful of the constitutional difficulty these can be meet by give authority to the chief executive who could proclaim additional duty to meet condition which the congress may designate at this point must disavow any desire to enlarge the executive 's power or add to the responsibility of the office be already too large if there be any other plan would prefer the grant of authority to proclaim would necessarily bring the|tariff|commission into new and enlarged activity because no executive could discharge such a duty except upon the information acquire and recommendation make by this commission but the plan be feasible and the proper functioning of the board would give well administration of a define policy than ever can be make possible by tariff duty prescribe without flexibility there be a manifest difference of opinion about the merit of american valuation many nation have adopt delivery valuation as the basis for collect duty that is take the cost of the import deliver at the port of entry as the basis for levy duty be no radical departure in view of vary condition and the disordered state of money value to provide for american valuation but there can not be ignore the danger of such a valuation bring to the level of own production cost make tariff prohibitive may do so in many instance where import ought to be encourage believe congress ought well consider the desirability of the only promising alternative namely a provision authorize proclaim american valuation under prescribe condition on any give list of article import in this propose flexibility authorize increase to meet condition so likely to change there should also be provision for decrease a rate may be just to day and entirely out of proportion six|month from to day if tariff be to be make equitable and not necessarily burden import and hinder trade abroad frequent adjustment will be necessary for year to come know the impossibility of modification by act of congress for any or a score of line without involve a long array of schedule think shall go a long way toward stabilization if there be recognition of the|tariff|commission 's fitness to recommend urgent change by proclamation be sure about public opinion favor the early determination of tariff policy there have be reassure sign of a business revival from the deep slump which all the world have be experience unemployment which give deep concern only|a|few|weeks|ago have grow encouragingly less and new assurance and renew confidence will attend the congressional declaration that american industry will be hold secure much have be say about the protective policy for make impossible for debtor to discharge obligation to this be a contention not now press for decision if must choose between a people in idleness press for the payment of indebtedness or a people resume the normal way of employment and carry the credit let choose the latter sometimes appraise large the human ill most vivid in mind have be give and be give now of influence and appeal to minimize the likelihood of war and throw off the crush burden of armament be all very earnest with a national soul impelling but a people unemployed and gaunt with hunger face a situation quite as disheartening as war and great obligation to day be to do the government 's part toward resume productivity and promote fortunate and remunerative employment something more than tariff protection be require by american agriculture to the farmer have come the early and the heavy burden of readjustment there be actual depression in agricultural industry while agricultural prosperity be absolutely essential to the general prosperity of the country congress have seek very earnestly to provide relief have promptly give such temporary relief as have be possible but the call be insistent for the permanent solution be inevitable that large crop lower the price and short crop advance no legislation can cure that fundamental law but there must be some economic solution for the excessive variation in return for agricultural production be rather shocking to be tell and to have the statement strongly support that 9,000,000|bale of cotton raise on american plantation in will actually be worth more to the producer than bale would have be equally shocking be the statement that 700,000,000|bushels of wheat raise by american farmer would bring more money than a bushel yet these be not exaggerated statement in a world where there be tens|of|million who need food and clothing which can not get such a condition be sure to indict the social system which make possible in the main the remedy lie in distribution and marketing every proper encouragement should be give to the cooperative marketing program these have prove very helpful to the cooperate community in europe in russia the cooperative community have become the recognize bulwark of law and order and save individualism from engulfment in social paralysis ultimately will be accredit with the salvation of the|russian|state there be the appeal for this experiment why not try no one challenge the right of the farmer to a large share of the consumer 's pay for product no one dispute that can not live without the farmer be justified in rebel against the transportation cost give a fair return for labor will have less occasion to appeal for financial aid and give assurance that labor shall not be in vain reassure all the people of a production sufficient to meet national requirement and guard against disaster the base of the pyramid of civilization which rest upon the soil be shrink through the drift of population from farm to city for a generation have be express more or less concern about this tendency economist have warn and statesman have deplore think for at time that modern convenience and the more intimate contact would halt the movement but have go steadily on perhaps only grim necessity will correct but ought to find a less drastic remedy the exist scheme of adjust freight rate have be favor the base point until industry be attract to some center and repel from other a great volume of uneconomic and wasteful transportation have attend and the cost increase accordingly the grain milling and meat pack industry afford ample illustration and the attend concentration be readily apparent the menace in concentration be not limit to the retardingly influence on agriculture manifestly the condition and term of railway transportation ought not be permit to increase this undesirable tendency have a just pride in great city but shall find a great pride in the nation which have large distribution of population into the country where comparatively self sufficient small community may blend agricultural and manufacturing interest in harmonious helpfulness and enhance good fortune such a movement contemplate no destruction of thing work of investment make or wealth involve only look to a general policy of transportation of distribute industry and of highway construction to encourage the spread of population and restore the proper balance between city and country the problem may well have earnest attention have be perhaps the proud claim of american civilization that in deal with human relationship have constantly move toward such justice in distribute the product of human energy that have improve continuously the economic status of the mass of people have be a highly productive social organization on the way up from the elemental stage of society have eliminate slavery and serfdom and be now far on the way to the elimination of poverty through the eradication of illiteracy and the diffussion of education mankind have reach a stage where may fairly say that in equality of opportunity have be attain though all be not prepared to embrace there be indeed a too great divergence between the economic condition of the most and the least favor class in the community but even that divergence have now come to the point where bracket the very poor and the very rich together as the least fortunate class effort may well be direct to improve the status of both while this set of problem be commonly comprehend under the general phrase capital and labor be really vastly broad be a question of social and economic organization labor have become a large contributor through saving to the stock of capital while the people who own the large individual aggregate of capital be often hard and earnest laborer very often be extremely difficult to draw the line of demarcation between the group to determine whether a particular individual be entitle to be set down as laborer or as capitalist in a very large proportion of case be both and when be both be the most useful citizen the right of labor to organize be just as fundamental and necessary as be the right of capital to organize the right of labor to negotiate to deal with and solve particular problem in an organized way through choose agent be just as essential as be the right of capital to organize to maintain corporation to limit the liability of stockholder indeed have come to recognize that the limited liability of the citizen as a member of a labor organization closely parallel the limitation of liability of the citizen as a stockholder in a corporation for profit along this line of reason shall make the great progress toward solution of problem of capital and labor in the case of the corporation which enjoy the privilege of limited liability of stockholder particularly when engage in in the public service be recognize that the outside public have a large concern which must be protect and so provide regulation restriction and in some case detailed supervision likewise in the case of labor organization may well apply similar and equally well define principle of regulation and supervision in order to conserve the public 's interest as affect by operation just as be not desirable that a corporation shall be allow to impose undue exaction upon the public so be not desirable that a labor organization shall be permit to exact unfair term of employment or subject the public to actual distress in order to enforce term finally just as be earnestly seek for procedure whereby to adjust and settle political difference between nation without resort to war so may well look about for mean to settle the difference between organized capital and organized labor without resort to those form of warfare which recognize under the name of strike lockout boycott and the like as have great body of law carefully regulate the organization and operation of industrial and financial corporation as have treaty and compact among nation which look to the settlement of difference without the necessity of conflict in arm so may well have plan of conference of common counsel of mediation arbitration and judicial determination in controversy between labor and capital to accomplish this would involve the necessity to develop a thoroughgoe code of practice in deal with such affair may be well to frankly set forth the superior interest of the community as a whole to either the labor group or the capital group with right privilege immunity and mode of organization thus carefully define should be possible to set up judicial or quasi judicial tribunal for the consideration and determination of all dispute which menace the public welfare in an industrial society such as the strike the lockout and the boycott be as much out of place and as disastrous in result as be war or armed revolution in the domain of politic the same disposition to reasonableness to conciliation to recognition of the other side 's point of view the same provision of fair and recognize tribunal and process ought to make possible to solve the set of question aseasily as the other believe the solution be possible the consideration of such a policy would necessitate the exercise of care and deliberation in the construction of a code and a charter of elemental right deal with the relation of employer and employee this foundation in the law deal with the modern condition of social and economic life would hasten the building of the temple of peace in industry which a rejoice nation would acclaim after each war until the last the government have be enable to give home to returned soldier and a large part of settlement and development have attend this generous provision of land for the nation 's defender there be yet unreserve approximately|200,000,000|acre in the public domain of which be know to be susceptible of reclamation and make fit for home by provision for irrigation the government have be assist in the development of remaining land until the estimate increase in land value in the irrigated section be full and the crop of alone on these land be estimate to exceed under the law authorization these expenditure for development the advance be to be return and would be good business for the government to provide lor the reclamation of the remain in addition to expedite the completion of project long under way under what be know as the coal and gas lease law applicable also to deposit of phosphate and other mineral on the public domain lease be now be make on the royalty basis and be produce large revenue to the government under this legislation per centum of all royalty be to be pay directly to the|federal|treasury and of the remainder per centum be to be use for reclamation of arid land by irrigation and per centum be to be pay to the states in which the operation be locate to be use by for school and road purpose these resource be so vast and the development be afford so reliable a basis of estimate that the|interior|department express the belief that ultimately the present law will add in royalty and payment to the treasury of the|federal|government and the state contain these public land a total of this mean of course an add wealth of many time that sum these prospect seem to afford every justification of government advance in reclamation and irrigation contemplate the inevitable and desirable increase of population there be another phase of reclamation full worthy of consideration there be of swamp and cut over land which may be reclaim and make as valuable as any farm land possess these acre be largely locate in southern|states and the great proportion be own by the states or by private citizen congress have a report of the survey of this field for reclamation and the feasibility be establish gladly commend federal aid by way of advance where state and private participation be assure home making be of the great benefit which government can bestow measure be pende embody this sound policy to which may well adhere be easily possible to make available permanent home which will provide in turn for prosperous american family without injurious competition with establish activity or imposition on wealth already acquire while be think of promote the fortune of own people be sure there be room in the sympathetic thought of america for fellow human being who be suffer and dying of starvation in russia a severe drought in the valley of the volga have plunge people into grievous famine voluntary agency be exert to the utmost to save the life of child in this area but be now evident that unless relief be afford the loss of life will extend into many|millions america can not be deaf to such a call as that do not recognize the government of russia nor tolerate the propaganda which emanate therefrom but do not forget the tradition of russian friendship may put aside consideration of all international politic and fundamental difference in government the big thing be the call of the suffering and the dying unreservedly recommend the appropriation necessary to supply the|american|relief|administration with of corn and 1,000,000|bushel of seed grain not alone to halt the wave of death through starvation but to enable spring planting in area where the seed grain have be exhaust temporarily to stem starvation the|american|relief|administration be direct in russia by former officer of own army and have fully demonstrate ability to transport and distribute relief through american hand without hindrance or loss the time have come to add the government 's support to the wonderful relief already work out of the generosity of the american private purse be not unaware that have suffering and privation at home when exceed the capacity for the relief within the states concern will have federal consideration seem to should be indifferent to own heart prompting and out of accord with the spirit which acclaim the christmastide if do not give out of national abundance to lighten this burden of woe upon a people blameless and helpless in famine 's peril there be a full score of topic concern which would be become to address and on which hope to make report at a later time have allude to the thing require early attention however can not end this limited address without a suggest amendment to the organic law many of belong to that school of thought which be hesitant about alter the fundamental law think tax problem the tendency of wealth to seek nontaxable investment and the menacing increase of public debt federal state and municipal all justify a proposal to change the constitution so as to end the issue of nontaxable bond no action can change the status of the many billion outstanding but can guard against future encouragement of capital 's paralysis while a halt in the growth of public indebtedness would be beneficial throughout whole land such a change in the constitution must be very thoroughly consider before submission there ought to be know what influence will have on the inevitable refunding of vast national debt how will operate on the necessary refunding of state and municipal debt how the advantage of nation over state and municipality or the contrary may be avoid clearly the states would not ratify to own apparent disadvantage suggest the consideration because the drift of wealth into nontaxable security be hinder the flow of large capital to industry manufacturing agricultural and carry until be discourage the very activity which make wealth agreeable to express desire and in complete accord with the purpose of the executive branch of the government there be in washington as happily know an international conference now most earnestly at work on plan for the limitation of armament a naval holiday and the just settlement of problem which may develop into cause of international disagreement be easy to believe a world hope be center on a most gratifying world accomplishment be not improbable transcript gentleman of the conference

freedom or deny aspiration or ignore national necessity republic would no more ask for these than would give no pride nee be humble no nationality submerge but would have a mergence of mind commit all of to less preparation for war and more enjoyment of fortunate peace the high hope come of the spirit of come together be but just to recognize varying need and peculiar position nothing can be accomplish in disregard of national apprehension rather should act together to remove the cause of apprehension this be not to be do in intrigue great assurance be find in the exchange of simple honesty and directness among man resolve to accomplish as become leader among nation when civilization have come to crucial test be not to be challenge that government fail when the excess of cost rob the people of the way to happiness and the opportunity to achieve if the finer sentiment be not urge the cold hard fact of excessive cost and the eloquence of economic would urge to reduce armament if the concept of a well order do not appeal then let ponder the burden and the blight of continued competition be not to be deny that the world have swing along throughout the age without heed this call from the kindly heart of man but the same world never before be so tragically bring to realization of the utter futility of passion ’s sway when reason and conscience and fellowship point a noble way

dominate by an immortal sentence of abraham lincoln's-"let have faith that right make may and in that faith let dare to do duty as understand sentence immortal because embody in a form of utter simplicity and purity the essential faith of the nation the faith in which be conceive and the faith in which have grow to glory and power with that faith and the birth of a nation found upon come the hope into the world that a new order would prevail throughout the affair of mankind an order in which reason and right would take precedence over covetousness and force and believe that express the wish and purpose of every thoughtful american when say that this sentence mark for in the plain manner the part should play alike in the arrangement of domestic affair and in exercise of influence upon the affair of the world by this faith and by this faith alone can the world be lift out of present confusion and despair be this faith which prevail over the wicked force of germany will remember that the beginning of the end of the war come when the german people find face to face with the conscience of the world and realize that right be everywhere array against the wrong that government be attempt to perpetrate think therefore that be true to say that this be the faith which win the war certainly this be the faith with which gallant man go into the field and out upon the sea to make sure of victory this be the mission upon which democracy come into the world democracy be an assertion of the right of the individual to live and to be treat justly as against any attempt on the part of any combination of individual to make law which will overburden or which will destroy equality among fellow in the matter of right or privilege and think all realize that the|day have come when democracy be be put upon final test the old world be just now suffer from a wanton rejection of the principle of democracy and a substitution of the principle of autocracy as assert in the name but without the authority and sanction of the multitude this be the time of all other when democracy should prove purity and spiritual power to prevail be surely the manif destiny of the|united|state to lead in the attempt to make this spirit prevail there be way in which the|united|state can assist to accomplish this great object first by offer the example within own border of the will and power of democracy to make and enforce law which be unquestionably just and which be equal in administration law which secure full right to labor and yet at the same time safeguard the integrity of property and particularly of that property which be devoted to the development of industry and the increase of the necessary wealth of the world second by stand for right and justice as toward individual nation the law of democracy be for the protection of the weak and the influence of every democracy in the world should be for the protection of the weak nation the nation which be struggle toward right and toward proper recognition and privilege in the family of nation the|united|state can not refuse this role of champion without put the stigma of rejection upon the great and devoted man who bring government into existence and establish in the face of almost universal opposition and intrigue even in the face of wanton force as for example against the orders in council|of|great|britain and the arbitrary napoleonic decree which involve in what know as the|war|of|1812 urge to consider that the display of an immediate disposition on the part of the congress to remedy any injustice or evil that may have show in own national life will afford the most effectual offset to the force of chaos and tyranny which be play so disastrous a part in the fortune of the free people of part of the world the|united|state be of necessity the sample democracy of the world and the triumph of democracy depend upon success recovery from the disturbing and sometimes disastrous effect of the late war have be exceedingly slow on the other side of the water and have give promise venture to say of early completion only in own fortunate country but even with the recovery halt and be impede at time and there be immediately serviceable act of legislation which seem to ought to attempt to assist that recovery and prove the indestructible recuperative force of a great government of the people of these be to prove that a great democracy can keep house as successfully and in as business like a fashion as any other government seem to that the first step toward provide this be to supply with a systematic method of handle estimate and expenditure and bring to the point where will not be an unnecessary strain upon income or necessitate unreasonable taxation in other word a workable budget system and respectfully suggest that element be essential to such a system namely not only that the proposal of appropriation should be in the hand of a single body such as a single appropriation committee in each house of the congress but also that this body should be bring into such cooperation with the departments of the government and with the treasury of the|united|state as would enable to act upon a complete conspectus of the need of the government and the resource from which must draw income reluctantly veto the budget bill pass by the last session of the congress because of a constitutional objection the|house|of|representative subsequently modify the bill in order to meet this objection in the revise form believe that the bill couple with action already take by the congress to revise rule and procedure furnish the foundation for an effective national budget system earnestly hope therefore that of the first step to be take by the present session of the congress will be to pass the budget bill the nation 's finance have show marked improvement during the|last|year the total ordinary receipt of for exceed those for by while the total net ordinary expenditure decrease from to the gross public debt which reach high point on august|31,|1919 when be have drop on november|30,|1920 to there have also be a marked decrease in holding of government war security by the banking institution of the country as well as in the amount of bill hold by the|federal|reserve|bank secure by government war obligation this fortunate result have relieve the bank and leave free to finance the need of agriculture,|industry and commerce have be due in large part to the reduction of the public debt especially of the float debt but more particularly to the improve distribution of government security among permanent investor the cessation of the government 's borrowing except through short term certificate of indebtedness have be a matter of great consequence to the people of the country at large as well as to the holder of liberty|bonds and victory|note and have have an important bearing on the matter of effective credit control the|year have be characterize by the progressive withdrawal of the treasury from the domestic credit market and from a position of dominant influence in that market the future course will necessarily depend upon the extent to which economy be practice and upon the burden place upon the treasury as well as upon industrial development and the maintenance of tax receipt at a sufficiently high level the fundamental fact which at present dominate the government 's financial situation be that seven|and|a|half|billion of war indebtedness mature within of this amount be float debt and five|billion victory|note and war savings|certificate the fiscal program of the government must be determine with reference to these maturity sound policy demand that government expenditure be reduce to the low amount which will permit the various service to operate efficiently and that government receipt from taxis and salvage be maintain sufficiently high to provide for current requirement include interest and sink fund charge on the public debt and at the same time retire the float debt and part of the victory|loan before maturity with rigid economy vigorous salvage operation and adequate revenue from taxation a surplus of current receipt over current expenditure can be realize and should be apply to the float debt all branch of the government should cooperate to see that this program be realize can not overemphasize the necessity of economy in government appropriation and expenditure and the avoidance by the congress of practice which take money from the treasury by indefinite or revolving fund appropriation the estimate for the|present|year show that over a dollar of expenditure be authorize by the last congress in addition to the amount show in the usual compile statement of appropriation this strikingly illustrate the importance of make direct and specific appropriation the relation between the current receipt and current expenditure of the government during as well as during the|last|half|of|the|last|fiscal|year have be disturb by the extraordinary burden throw upon the treasury by the|transportation|act in connection with the return of the railroad to private control over have already be pay to the railroad under this act-$350,000,000 during the|present|fiscal|year and be estimate that further payment aggregate possibly must still be make to the railroad during the|current|year be obvious that these large payment have already seriously limit the government 's progress in retire the float debt closely connected with this seem to be the necessity for an immediate consideration of the revision of tax law simplification of the income and profit taxis have become an immediate necessity these taxis perform an indispensable service during the war the need for simplification however be very great in order to save the taxpayer inconvenience and expense and in order to make liability more certain and definite other and more detailed recommendation with regard to taxis will no doubt be lay before by the secretary of the treasury and the commissioner of internal|revenue be privilege to draw to the attention of congress for very sympathetic consideration the problem of provide adequate facility for the care and treatment of former member of the military and naval force who be sick and disabled as the result of participation in the war these heroic man can never be pay in money for the service patriotically render the nation reward will lie rather in realization of the fact that vindicate the right of country and aid in safeguard civilization the nation 's gratitude must be effectively reveal to by the most ample provision for medical care and treatment as well as for vocational training and placement the time have come when a more complete program can be formulate and more satisfactorily administer for treatment and training and earnestly urge that the congress give the matter early consideration the secretary of the treasury and the|board|for|vocational|education will outline in annual report proposal cover medical care and rehabilitation which be sure will engage earnest study and commend most generous support permit to emphasize once more the need for action upon certain matter upon which dwelt at some length in message to the second session of the sixty sixth congress the necessity for example of encourage the manufacture of dyestuff and related chemical the importance of do everything possible to promote agricultural production along economic line to improve agricultural marketing and to make rural life more attractive and healthful the need for a law regulate cold storage in such a way as to limit the time during which good may be keep in storage prescribe the method of dispose of if keep beyond the permit period and require good release from storage in all case to bear the date of receipt would also be most serviceable if be provide that all good release from cold storage for interstate shipment should have plainly mark upon each package the selling or market price at which go into storage in order that the purchaser may be able to learn what profit stand between and the producer or the wholesale dealer indeed would be very serviceable to the public if all good destine for interstate commerce be make to carry upon every packing case whose form make possible a plain statement of the price at which leave the hand of the producer respectfully call attention also to the recommendation of the message refer to with regard to a federal license for all corporation engage in interstate commerce in brief the immediate legislative need of the time be the removal of all obstacle to the realization of the good ambition of people in several class of employment and the strengthening of all instrumentality by which difficulty be to be meet and remove and justice deal out whether by law or by some form of mediation and conciliation do not feel to be privilege at present to suggest the detailed and particular method by which these object may be attain but have faith that the inquiry of several committee will discover the way and the method in response to what believe to be the impulse of sympathy and opinion throughout the|united|state earnestly suggest that the congress authorize the treasury of the|united|state to make to the struggle government of armenia such a loan as be make to several of the allied government during the war and would also suggest that would be desirable to provide in the legislation that the expenditure of the money thus loan should be under the supervision of a commission or at least a commissioner from the|united|state in order that revolutionary tendency within armenia may not be afford by the loan a further tempting opportunity allow to call attention to the fact that the people of the|philippine|island have succeed in maintain a stable government since the last action of the congress in behalf and have thus fulfil the condition set by the congress as precedent to a consideration of grant independence to the islands respectfully submit that this condition precedent have be fulfil be now liberty and duty to keep promise to the people of those island by grant the independence which so honorably covet have not so much lay before a series of recommendation gentleman as seek to utter a confession of

opening of this session of the congress be thus prevent from present in as direct a way as could wish the many question that be press for solution at this time happily have have the advantage of the advice of the head of the several executive department who have keep in close touch with affair in detail and whose thoughtful recommendation earnestly second in the matter of the railroad and the readjustment of affair grow out of federal control shall take the liberty at a later date of address hope that congress will bring to a conclusion at this session legislation look to the establishment of a budget system that there should be single authority responsible for the making of all appropriation and that appropriation should be make not independently of each other but with reference to single comprehensive plan of expenditure properly relate to the nation 's income there can be no doubti believe the burden of prepare the budget must in the nature of the case if the work be to be properly do and responsibility concentrate instead of divided rest upon the executive the budget so prepared should be submit to and approve or amend by a single committee of each|house|of|congress and no single appropriation should be make by the congress except such as may have be include in the budget prepare by the executive or add by the particular committee of congress charge with the budget legislation another and not less important aspect of the problem be the ascertainment of the economy and efficiency with which the money appropriate be expend under exist law the only audit be for the purpose of ascertaining whether expenditure have be lawfully make within the appropriation no one be authorize or equip to ascertain whether the money have be spend wisely economically and effectively the auditor should be highly train official with permanent tenure in the|treasury|department free of obligation to or motif of consideration for this or any subsequent administration and authorize and empower to examine into and make report upon the method employ and the result obtain by the executive department of the government report should be make to the congress and to the secretary of the treasury trust that the congress will give immediate consideration to the problem of future taxation simplification of the income and profit taxis have become an immediate necessity these taxis perform indispensable service during the war must however be simplify not only to save the taxpayer inconvenience and expense but in order that liability may be make certain and definite with reference to the detail of the|revenue|law the secretary of the treasury and the commissioner of internal|revenue will lay before for consideration certain amendment necessary or desirable in connection with the administration of the law recommendation which have approval and support be of the utmost importance that in deal with this matter the present law should not be disturb so far as regard taxis for the calendar year|1920 payable in the congress may well consider whether the high rate of income and profit taxis can in peace time be effectively productive of revenue and whether may not on the contrary be destructive of business activity and productive of waste and inefficiency there be a point at which in peace time high rate of income and profit taxis discourage energy remove the incentive to new enterprise encourage extravagant expenditure and produce industrial stagnation with consequent unemployment and other attendant evil the problem be not an easy one a fundamental change have take place with reference to the position of america in the world 's affair the prejudice and passion engender by decade of controversy between school of political and economic thought,-the believer in protection of american industry the other believer in tariff for revenue only,-must be sbordinate to the single consideration of the public interest in the light of utterly change condition before the war america be heavily the debtor of the rest of the world and the interest payment have to make to foreign country on american security hold abroad the expenditure of american traveler abroad and the ocean freight charge have to pay to other about balance the value of pre - war favorable balance of trade during the war america 's export nave be greatly stimulate and increase price have increase value on the other hand have purchase a large proportion of the american security previously hold abroad have loan some|$9,000,000,000 to foreign government and have build own ship favorable balance of trade have thus be greatly increase and europe have be deprive of the mean of meeting heretofore exist europe can have only|three way of meet the favorable balance of trade in peace time by import into this country of gold or of good or by establish new credit europe be in no position at the present time to ship gold to nor could contemplate large further import of gold into this country without concern the time have nearly pass for international governmental loan and will take time to develop in this country a market for foreign security anything therefore which would tend to prevent foreign country from settle for export by shipment of good into this country could only have the effect of prevent from pay for export and therefore of prevent the export from be make the productivity of the country greatly stimulate by the war must find an outlet by export to foreign country and any measure take to prevent import will inevitably curtail export force curtailment of production load the banking machinery of the country with credit to carry unsold product and produce industrial stagnation and unemployment if want to sell must be prepared to buy whatever therefore may have be view during the period of growth of american business concern tariff legislation must now adjust own economic life to a change condition grow out of the fact that american business be full grown and that america be the great capitalist in the world no policy of isolation will satisfy the grow need and opportunity of america the provincial standard and policy of the past which have hold american business as if in a strait jacket must yield and give way to the need and exigency of in which live a|day full of hope and promise for american business if will but take advantage of the opportunity that be ours for the asking the recent war have end isolation and throw upon a great duty and responsibility the|united|states must share the expand world market the|united|states desire for only equal opportunity with the other nation of the world and that through the process of friendly cooperation and fair competition the legitimate interest of the nation concern may be successfully and equitably adjust there be other matter of importance upon which urge action at the last session of congress which be still press for solution be sure be not necessary for again to remind there be immediate and very practicable question result from the war which should meet in the most liberal spirit be a matter of recognition and relief to soldier can do no well than to quote from last message urge this very action must see to that return soldier be assist in every practicable way to find the place for which be fit in the daily work of the country this can be do by develop and maintain upon an adequate scale the admirable organization create by the|department|of|labor for place man seek work and can also be do in at|least|one very great field by create new opportunity for individual enterprise the secretary of the interior have point out the way by which return soldier may be help to find and take up land in the hitherto undeveloped region of the country which the|federal|government have already prepare or can readily prepare for cultivation and also on many of the cutover or neglect area which lie within the limit of the old state and once more take the liberty of recommend very urgently that plan shall receive the immediate and substantial support of the congress in the matter of tariff legislation beg to call attention to the statement contain in last message urge legislation with reference to the establishment of the chemical and dyestuff industry in america among the industry to which special consideration should be give be that of the manufacture of dyestuff and related chemical complete dependence upon german supply before the war make the interruption of trade a cause of exceptional economic disturbance the close relation between the manufacture of dyestuff on the hand and of explosive and poisonous gas on the other moreover have give the industry an exceptional significance and value although the|united|state will gladly and unhesitatingly join in the programme of international disarmament will nevertheless be a policy of obvious prudence to make certain of the successful maintenance of many strong and well equip chemical plant the german chemical industry with which will be bring into competition be may well be again a thoroughly knit monopoly capable of exercise a competition of a peculiarly insidious and dangerous kind during the war the farmer perform a vital and willing service to the nation by materially increase the production of land supply america and the allies with the increase amount of food necessary to keep immense army in the field indispensably help to win the war but there be now scarcely less need of increase the production in food the necessary of life ask the congress to consider mean of encouraging effort along these line the importance of do everything possible to promote production along economical line to improve marketing and to make rural life more attractive and healthful be obvious would urge approval of the plan already propose to the congress by the secretary of agriculture to secure the essential fact require for the proper study of this question through the propose enlarged programme for farm management study and crop estimate would urge also the continuance of federal participation in the building of good road under the term of exist law and under the direction of present agency the need of further action on the part of the states and the|federal|government to preserve and develop forest resource especially through the practice of well forestry method on private holding and the extension of the publicly own forest well support for country school and the more definite direction of course of study along line relate to rural problem and fuller provision for sanitation in rural district and the building up of need hospital and medical facility in these locality perhaps the way may be clear for many of these desirable reform by a fresh comprehensive survey make of rural condition by a conference compose of representative of the farmer and of the agricultural agency responsible for leadership would call attention to the widespread condition of political restlessness in body politic the cause of this unrest while various and complicated be superficial rather than deep seated broadly arise from or be connect with the failure on the part of government to arrive speedily at a just and permanent peace permitting return to normal condition from the transfusion of radical theory from seethe european center pende such delay from heartless profiteering result in the increase of the cost of living and lastly from the machination of passionate and malevolent agitator with the return to normal condition this unrest will rapidly disappear in the meantime do much evil seem to that in deal with this situation congress should not be impatient or drastic but should seek rather to remove the cause should endeavor to bring country back speedily to a peace basis with ameliorate live condition under the minimum of restriction upon personal liberty that be consistent with reconstruction problem and should arm the|federal|government with power to deal in criminal court with those person who by violent method would abrogate time test institution with the free expression of opinion and with the advocacy of orderly political change however fundamental there must be no interference but towards passion and malevolence tendine to incite crime and insurrection under guise of political evolution there should be no leniency legislation to this end have be recommend by the attorney general and should be enact in this direct connection would call attention to recommendation on august|8th point out legislative measure which wouldbe effective in control and bring down the present cost of living which contribute so largely to this unrest on only|one of these recommendation have the congress act if the government 's campaign be to be effective be necessary that the other step suggest should be act on at once renew and strongly urge the necessity of the extension of the present food|control|act as to the period of time in which shall remain in operation the attorney general have submit a bill provide for an extension of this act for a period of six|month as now stand be limit in operation to the period of the war and become inoperative upon the formal proclamation of peace be imperative that should be extend at once the department of justice have build up extensive machinery for the purpose of enforce provision all of which must be abandon upon the conclusion of peace unless the provision of this act be extend during this period the congress will have an opportunity to make similar permanent provision and regulation with regard to all good destine for interstate commerce and to exclude from interstate shipment if the requirement of the law be not compile with some such regulation be imperatively necessary the abuse that have grow up in the manipulation of price by the withholding of foodstuff and other necessary of life can not otherwise be effectively prevent there can be no doubt of either the necessity of the legitimacy of such measure as point out in last message publicity can accomplish a great deal in this campaign the aim of the government must be clearly bring to the attention of the consume public civic organization and state official who be in a position to lend assistance to effort have make available fund with which to carry on this campaign but there be no provision in the law authorize expenditure for the purpose of make the public fully informed about the effort of the government specific recommendation have be make by the attorney general in this regard would strongly urge upon immediate adoption as constitute of the preliminary step to this campaign also renew recommendation that the congress pass a law regulate cold storage as be regulate for example by the law of the state of new|jersey which limit the time during which good may be keep in storage prescribe the method of dispose of if keep beyond the permit period and require that good release from storage shall in all case bear the date of receipt would materially add to the serviceability of the law for the purpose now have in view if be also prescribe that all good release from storage for interstate shipment should have plainly mark upon each package the selling or market price at which go into storage by this mean the purchaser would always be able to learn what profit stand between and the producer or the wholesale dealer would also renew recommendation that all good destine for interstate commerce should in every case where form or package make possible be plainly mark with the price at which leave the hand of the producer should formulate a law require a federal license of all corporation engage in interstate commerce and embodying in the license or in the condition under which be to be issue specific regulation design to secure competitive selling and prevent unconscionable profit in the method of marketing such a law would afford a welcome opportunity to effect other much need reform in the business of interstate shipment and in the method of corporation which be engage in but for the moment confine recommendation to the object immediately in hand which be to lower the cost of living no one who have observe the march of event in the|last|year can fail to note the absolute need of a definite programme to bring about an improvement in the condition of labor there can be no settle condition lead to increase production and a reduction in the cost of live if labor and capital be to be antagonist instead of partner sound thinking and an honest desire to serve the interest of the whole nation as distinguish from the interest of a class must be apply to the solution of this great and press problem the failure of other nation to consider this matter in a vigorous way have produce bitterness and jealousy and antagonism the food of radicalism the only way to keep man from agitate against grievance be to remove the grievance an unwillingness even to discuss these matter produce only dissatisfaction and give comfort to the extreme element in country which endeavor to stir up disturbance in order to provoke government to embark upon a course of retaliation and repression the seed of revolution be repression the remedy for these thing must not be negative in character must be constructive must comprehend the general interest the real antidote for the unrest which manifest be not suppression but a deep consideration of the wrong that beset national life and the application of a remedy congress have already show willingness to deal with these industrial wrong by establish the hour|day as the standard in every field of labor have seek to find a way to prevent child labor have serve the whole country by lead the way in develop the mean of preserve and safeguard life and health in dangerous industry must now help in the difficult task of find a method that will bring about a genuine democratization of industry base upon the full recognition of the right of those who work in whatever rank to participate in some organic way in every decision which directly affect welfare be with this purpose in mind that call a conference to meet in washington on december|1st to consider these problem in all broad aspect with the idea of bring about a well understanding between these interest the great unrest throughout the world out of which have emerge a demand for an immediate consideration of the difficulty between capital and labor bid put own house in order frankly there can be no permanent and last settlement between capital and labor which do not recognize the fundamental concept for which labor have be struggle through the|year the whole world give recognition and endorsement to these fundamental purpose in the statesman gather at versailles recognize the fact that world stability could not be have by revert to industrial standard and condition against which the average workman of the world have revolt be therefore the task of the statesman of this new day of change and readjustment to recognize world condition and to seek to bring about through legislation condition that will mean the ending of age long antagonism between capital and labor and that will hopefully lead to the building up of a comradeship which will result not only in great contentment among the mass of workman but also bring about a great production and a great prosperity to business to analyze the particular in the demand of labor be to admit the justice of complaint in many matter that lie at basis the workman demand an adequate wage sufficient to permit to live in comfort unhampered by the fear of poverty and want in old age demand the right to live and the right to work amidst sanitary surrounding both in home and in workshop surrounding that develop and do not retard own health and wellbeing and the right to provide for child 's want in the matter of health and education in other word be desire to make the condition of life and the life of those dear to tolerable and easy to bear the establishment of the principle regard labor lay down in the covenant of the|league|of|nations offer the way to industrial peace and conciliation no other road lie open to not to pursue this one be long to invite enmity bitterness and antagonism which in the end only lead to industrial and social disaster the unwilling workman be not a profitable servant an employee whose industrial life be hedge about by hard and unjust condition which do not create and over which have no control lack that fine spirit of enthusiasm and volunteer effort which be the necessary ingredient of a great produce entity let be frank about this solemn matter the evidence of world wide unrest which manifest in violence throughout the world bid pause and consider the mean to be find to stop the spread of this contagious thing before sap the very vitality of the nation do gain strength by withhold the remedy or be not the business of statesman to treat these manifestation of unrest which meet on every hand as evidence of an economic disorder and to apply constructive remedy wherever necessary be sure that in the application of the remedy touch not the vital tissue of industrial and economic life there can be no recession of the tide of unrest until constructive instrumentality be set up to stem that tide government must recognize the right of man collectively to bargain for humane object that have at base the mutual protection and welfare of those engage in all industry labor must not be longer treat as a commodity must be regard as the activity of human being possess of deep yearning and desire the busi ness man give good thought to the repair and replenishment of machinery so that usefulness will not be impair and power to produce may always be at height and keep in full vigor and motion no less regard ought to be pay to the human machine which after all propel the machinery of the world and be the great dynamic force that lie back of all industry and progress return to the old standard of wage and industry in employment be unthinkable the terrible tragedy of war which have just end and which have bring the world to the verge of chaos and disaster would be in vain if there should ensue a return to the condition of the past europe whence have come the unrest which now hold the world at bay be an example of standpatism in these vital human matter which america may well accept as an example not to be follow but studiously to be avoid europe make labor the differential and the price of all be enmity and antagonism and prostrate industry the right of labor to live in peace and comfort must be recognize by government and america should be the first to lay the foundation stone upon which industrial peace shall be build labor not only be entitle to an adequate wage but capital should receive a reasonable return upon investment and be entitle to protection at the hand of the government in every emergency no government worthy of the name can play these element against each other for there be a mutuality of interest between which the government must seek to express and to safeguard at all cost the right of individual to strike be inviolate and ought not to be interfere with by any process of government but there be a predominant right and that be the right of the government to protect all of people and to assert power and majesty against the challenge of any class the government when assert that right seek not to antagonize a class but simply to defend the right of the whole people as against the irreparable harm and injury that may be do by the attempt by any class to usurp a power that only government have a right to exercise as a protection to all in the matter of international dispute which have lead to war statesman have seek to set up as a remedy arbitration for war do this not point the way for the settlement of industrial dispute by the establishment of a tribunal fair and just alike to all which will settle industrial dispute which in the past have lead to war and disaster america witness the evil consequence which have follow out of such dispute between these contend force must not admit impotent to deal with these matter by mean of peaceful process surely there must be some method of bring together in a council of peace and amity these great interest out of which will come a happy day of peace and cooperation a day that will make man more hopeful and enthusiastic in various task that will make for more comfort and happiness in living and a more tolerable condition among all class of man certainly human intelligence can devise some acceptable tribunal for adjust the difference between capital and labor this be the|hour of test and trial for america by prowess and strength and the indomitable courage of soldier demonstrate power to vindicate on foreign battlefield conception of liberty and justice let not influence as a mediator between capital and labor be weaken and own failure to settle matter of purely domestic concern be proclaim to the world there be those in this country who threaten direct action to force will upon a majority russia today with blood and terror be a painful object lesson of the power of minority make little difference what minority be whether capital or labor or any other class no sort of privilege will ever be permit to dominate this country be a partnership or nothing that be worth while be a democracy where the majority be the master or all the hope and purpose of the man who found this government have be defeat and forget in america there be but way by which great reform can be accomplish and the relief seek by class obtain and that be through the orderly process of representative government those who would propose any other method of reform be enemy of this country america will not be daunt by
