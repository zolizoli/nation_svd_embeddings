transcript thank thank very much thank and good evening the sponsor have be identify but unlike most television program the performer have not be provide with a script as a matter of fact have be permit to choose own word and discuss own idea regard the choice that face in the|next|few|week have spend most of life as a democrat recently have see fit to follow another course believe that the issue confront cross party line now side in this campaign have be tell that the issue of this election be the maintenance of peace and prosperity the line have be use have never have so good but have an uncomfortable feeling that this prosperity be not something on which can base hope for the future no nation in history have ever survive a tax burden that reach a|third of national income today out of every dollar earn in this country be the tax collector 's share and yet government continue to spend a day more than the government take in have not balance budget out of the|last|34|year have raise debt limit time in and now national debt be one|and|a|half time big than all the combined debt of all the nation of the world have in gold in treasury do not own an ounce foreign dollar claim be 27.3|billion|dollar and have just have announce that the dollar of will now purchase 45|cent in total value as for the peace that would preserve wonder who among would like to approach the wife or mother whose husband or son have die in south|vietnam and ask if think this be a peace that should be maintain indefinitely do mean peace or do mean just want to be leave in peace there can be no real peace while american be die some place in the world for the rest of be at war with the most dangerous enemy that have ever face mankind in long climb from the swamp to the star and be be say if lose that war and in so do lose this way of freedom of history will record with the great astonishment that those who have the most to lose do the least to prevent happening well think be time ask if still know the freedom that be intend for by the founding father not too long ago friend of mine be talk to a cuban refugee a businessman who have escape from castro and in the midst of story of friend turn to the other and say do not know how lucky be and the cuban stop and say how lucky be have someplace to escape to and in that sentence tell the entire story if lose freedom here there be no place to escape to this be the last stand on earth and this idea that government be beholden to the people that have no other source of power except the sovereign people be still the new and the most unique idea in all the long history of man's&nbsp;relation to man this be the issue of this election whether believe in capacity for self government or whether abandon the american revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far distant capitol can plan life for well than can plan and be tell increasingly have to choose between a left or right well would like to suggest there be no such thing as a left or right there be only an up or down—[up man 's old old aged dream the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with law and order or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism and regardless of sincerity humanitarian motif those who would trade freedom for security have embark on this downward course in this vote harvesting time use term like the|"great|society or as be tell a|few|days|ago by the president must accept a great government activity in the affair of the people but have be a little more explicit in the past and among and all of the thing now will quote have appear in print these be not republican accusation for example have voice that say the cold war will end through acceptance of a not undemocratic socialism another voice say the profit motive have become outmoded must be replace by the incentive of the welfare state or traditional system of individual freedom be incapable of solve the complex problem of the|20th|century senator fullbright have say at stanford|university that the constitution be outmode refer to the president as moral teacher and leader and say be hobble in task by the restriction of power impose on by this antiquated document must be free so that can do for what know be good and senator clark of pennsylvania another articulate spokesman define liberalism as meet the material need of the masse through the full power of centralized government well for resent when a representative of the people refer to and the free man and woman of this country as the masse this be a term have not apply to in america but beyond that the full power of centralized be the very thing the founding fathers seek to minimize know that government do not control thing a government can not control the economy without control people and know when a government set out to do that must use force and coercion to achieve purpose also know those founding|father that outside of legitimate function government do nothing as well or as economically as the private sector of the economy now have no well example of this than government 's involvement in the farm economy over the|last|30|years since the cost of this program have nearly double fourth of farm in america be responsible for of the farm surplus fourth of farming be out on the free market and have know a increase in the consumption of all produce see that fourth of farm that be regulate and control by the federal government in have spend in the feed grain program for every dollar bushel of corn do not grow senator humphrey last|week charge that barry|goldwater as president would seek to eliminate farmer should do homework a little well because will find out that have have a decline of in the farm population under these government program will also find that the democratic administration have seek to get from congress an extension of the farm program to include that fourth that be now free will find that have also ask for the right to imprison farmer who would not keep book as prescribe by the federal government the secretary of agriculture ask for the right to seize farm through condemnation and resell to other individual and contain in that same program be a provision that would have allow the federal government to remove farmer from the soil at the same time there be be an increase in the|department|of|agriculture employee there be now for every farm in the|united|state and still can not tell how shipload of grain head for austria disappear without a trace and billie|sol|este never leave shore every responsible farmer and farm organization have repeatedly ask the government to free the farm economy but how — who be farmer to know what be good for the wheat farmer vote against a wheat program the government pass anyway now the price of bread go up the price of wheat to the farmer go down meanwhile back in the city under urban renewal the assault on freedom carry on private property right be so diluted that public interest be almost anything a few government planner decide should be in a program that take from the needy and give to the greedy see such spectacle as in cleveland ohio a and a half dollar building complete only|three|years|ago must be destroy to make way for what government official call a more compatible use of the land the president tell be now go to start build public housing unit in the thousand where heretofore have only build in the hundred but fha federal|housing|authority and the|veterans|administration tell have housing unit have take back through mortgage foreclosure for three|decades have seek to solve the problem of unemployment through government planning and the more the plan fail the more the planner plan the late be the|area|redevelopment|agency have just declare rice|county kansas a depressed area rice|county kansas have two|hundre oil well and the people there have over|30|million|dollar on deposit in personal saving in bank and when the government tell be depressed lie down and be depressed have so many people who can not see a fat man stand beside a thin one without come to the conclusion the fat man get that way by take advantage of the thin one so be go to solve all the problem of human misery through government and government planning well now if government planning and welfare have the answer and have have almost|30|year of shouldn't expect government to read the score to once in a while should not be tell about the decline each|year in the number of people need help the reduction in the need for public housing but the reverse be true each year the need grow great the program grow great be tell that people go to bed hungry each|night well that be probably true be all on a diet but now be tell that family in this country be poverty stricken on the basis of earn less|than|3,000|dollar a year welfare spending be time great than in the dark depth of the depression be spend on welfare now do a little arithmetic and will find that if divide the|45|billion|dollar up equally among those poor family would be able to give each family a year and this add to present income should eliminate poverty direct aid to the poor however be only run per family would seem that someplace there must be some overhead now so now declare war on poverty or too can be a bobby|baker now do honestly expect to believe that if add 1|billion|dollar to the 45|billion be spend more program to the have and remember this new program do not replace any just duplicate exist program do believe that poverty be suddenly go to disappear by magic well in all fairness should explain there be part of the new program that be not duplicate this be the youth feature be now go to solve the dropout problem juvenile delinquency by reinstitute something like the old ccc camp civilian|conservation|corps and be go to put young people in these camp but again do some arithmetic and find that be go to spend each|year just on room and board for each young person help a year can send to harvard for course do not get wrong be not suggest harvard be the answer to juvenile delinquency but seriously what be do to those seek to help not too long ago a judge call here in los|angeles tell of a young woman who 'd come before for a divorce have child be pregnant with seventh under questioning reveal husband be a laborer earn a month want a divorce to get an raise be eligible for a month in get the idea from woman in neighborhood who have already do that very thing yet anytime and question the scheme of the do gooder be denounce as be against humanitarian goal say be always against thing we're never for anything well the trouble with liberal friend be not that be ignorant be just that know so much that be not so now we're for a provision that destitution should not follow unemployment by reason of old age and to that end have accept social|security as a step toward meet the problem but be against those entrust with this program when practice deception regard fiscal shortcoming when charge that any criticism of the program mean that want to end payment to those people who depend on for a livelihood have call insurance to in a|hundred|million piece of literature but then appear before the|supreme|court and testify be a welfare program only use the term insurance to sell to the people and say social|security due be a tax for the general use of the government and the government have use that tax there be no fund because robert|byer the actuarial head appear before a congressional committee and admit that social|security as of this moment be in the hole but say there should be no cause for worry because as long as have the power to tax could always take away from the people whatever need to bail out of trouble and be do just that a young man work at an average salary social|security contribution would in the open market buy an insurance policy that would guarantee a month at the government promise could live up until be and then take out a policy that would pay more than social|security now be so lack in business sense that can not put this program on a sound basis so that people who do require those payment will find can get when be due that the cupboard be not bare barry|goldwater think can at the same time can not introduce voluntary feature that would permit a citizen who can do better on own to be excuse upon presentation of evidence that have make provision for the non - earning year should not allow a widow with child to work and not lose the benefit supposedly pay for by deceased husband should not and be allow to declare who beneficiary will be under this program which can not do think be for tell senior citizen that no one in this country should be deny medical care because of a lack of fund but think be against force all citizen regardless of need into a compulsory government program especially when have such example as be announce last|week when france admit that medicare program be now bankrupt have come to the end of the road in addition be barry|goldwater so irresponsible when suggest that government give up program of deliberate planned inflation so that when do get social|security pension a dollar will buy a dollar 's worth and not worth think be for an international organization where the nation of the world can seek peace but think be against subordinate american interest to an organization that have become so structurally unsound that today can muster a third vote on the floor of the|general|assembly among nation that represent less|than|10|percent of the world 's population think be against the hypocrisy of assail ally because here and there cling to a colony while engage in a conspiracy of silence and never open mouth about|the|million of people enslave in the soviet colony in the satellite nation think be for aid ally by sharing of material blessing with those nation which share in fundamental belief but be against dole out money government to government create bureaucracy if not socialism all over the world set out to help country be help have spend with that money buy a yacht for haile|selassie buy dress suit for greek undertaker extra wife for kenya[n government official buy a tv set for a place where have no electricity in the|last|six|year nation have buy 7|billion|dollar worth of gold and all be receive foreign aid from this country no government ever voluntarily reduce in size so government ' program once launch never disappear actually a government bureau be the near thing to eternal life will ever see on this earth federal employee — federal employee number two|and|a|half|million and federal state and local out of of the nation 's work force employ by government these proliferating bureaus with thousand of regulation have cost many of constitutional safeguard how many of realize that today federal agent can invade a man 's property without a warrant can impose a fine without a formal hearing let alone a trial by jury and can seize and sell property at auction to enforce the payment of that fine in arkansas james|wier over plant rice allotment the government obtain a judgment and a u.s. marshal sell farm at auction the government say be necessary as a warning to other to make the system work last|february|19th at the|university|of|minnesota norman|thomas time candidate for president on the socialist|party ticket say if barry|goldwater become president would stop the advance of socialism in the|united|state think that be exactly what will do but as a former democrat can tell norman|thomas be not the only man who have draw this parallel to socialism with the present administration because back in mr. democrat the great american come before the american people and charge that the leadership of party be take the|party|of|jefferson,|jackson and cleveland down the road under the banner of marx lenin and stalin and walk away from party and never return til the|day die because to this|day the leadership of that party have be take that party that honorable party down the road in the image of the labor socialist|party|of|england now do not require expropriation or confiscation of private property or business to impose socialism on a people what do mean whether hold the deed to the — or the title to business or property if the government hold the power of life and death over that business or property and such machinery already exist the government can find some charge to bring against any concern choose to prosecute every businessman have own tale of harassment somewhere a perversion have take place natural unalienable right be now consider to be a dispensation of government and freedom have never be so fragile so close to slip from grasp as be at this moment democratic opponent seem unwilling to debate these issue want to make and believe that this be a contest between man that be to choose just between personality well what of this man that would destroy and in destroy would destroy that which represent the idea that and hold dear be the brash and shallow and trigger happy man say be well have be privilege to know when know long before ever dream of try for high office and can tell personally have never know a man in life believe so incapable of do a dishonest or dishonorable thing this be a man who in own business before enter politic institute a profit sharing plan before union have ever think of put in health and medical insurance for all employee take of the profit before taxis and set up a retirement program a pension plan for all employee send monthly check for life to an employee who be ill and could not work provide nursing care for the child of mother who work in the store when mexico be ravage by the flood in climb in airplane and fly medicine and supply down there an ex - gi tell how meet be the|week|before|christmas during and be at the los|angeles airport try to get a ride home to arizona for christmas and say that there be a lot of serviceman there and no seat available on the plane and then a voice come over the loudspeaker and say any man in uniform want a ride to arizona go to runway such and such and go down there and there be a fellow name barry|goldwater sit in plane every|day in those|weeks|before|christma all day long would load up the plane fly to arizona fly to home fly back over to get another load during the hectic split second timing of a campaign this be a man who take time out to sit beside an old friend who be die of cancer campaign manager be understandably impatient but say there be not many leave who care what happen to would like to know care this be a man who say to 19-year old son there be no foundation like the rock of honesty and fairness and when begin to build life on that rock with the cement of the faith in god that have then have a real start this be not a man who could carelessly send other people 's son to war and that be the issue of this campaign that make all the other problem have discuss academic unless realize be in a war that must be win those who would trade freedom for the soup kitchen of the welfare state have tell have a utopian solution of peace without victory call policy accommodation and say if will only avoid any direct confrontation with the enemy will forget evil way and learn to love all who oppose be indict as warmonger say offer simple answer to complex problem well perhaps there be a simple answer — not an easy answer — but simple if and have the courage to tell elect official that want national policy base on what know in heart be morally right can not buy security freedom from the threat of the bomb by commit an immorality so great as say to a human being now enslave behind the iron curtain give up dream of freedom because to save own skin be willing to make a deal with slave master alexander|hamilton say a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger be prepare for a master and deserve now let set the record straight there be no argument over the choice between peace and war but there be only guarantee way can have peace and can have in the next second — surrender admittedly there be a risk in any course follow other than this but every lesson of history tell that the great risk lie in appeasement and this be the specter well mean liberal friend refuse to face that policy of accommodation be appeasement and give no choice between peace and war only between fight or surrender if continue to accommodate continue to back and retreat eventually have to face the final demand the ultimatum and what then when nikita|khrushchev have tell people know what answer will be have tell that be retreat under the pressure of and someday when the time come to deliver the final ultimatum surrender will be voluntary because by that time will have be weaken from within spiritually morally and economically believe this because from side be hear voice plead for peace at any price or well red than dead or as commentator put would rather live on knee than die on foot and therein lie the road to war because those voice do not speak for the rest of and know and do not believe that life be so dear and peace so sweet as to be purchase at the price of chain and slavery if nothing in life be worth die for when do this begin just in the face of this enemy or should moses have tell the child of israel to live in slavery under the pharaohs should christ have refuse the cross should the patriot at concord|bridge have throw down gun and refuse to fire the shot hear round the world the martyr of history be not fool and honor dead who give life to stop the advance of the nazis do not die in vain where then be the road to peace well be a simple answer after all and have the courage to say to enemy there be a price will not pay there be a point beyond which must not advance and this this be the meaning in the phrase of barry|goldwater 's peace through strength winston|churchill say the destiny of man be not measure by material computation when great force be on the move in the world learn be spirit not animal and say there be something go on in time and space and beyond time and space which whether like or not spell duty and have a rendezvous with destiny will preserve for child this the last good hope of man on earth or will sentence to take the last step into a|thousand|years of darkness will keep in mind and remember that barry|goldwater have faith in have faith that and have the ability and the dignity and the right to make own decision and determine own destiny thank very much view transcript transcript & nbsp fellow americans on thursday|of|last|week from the kremlin in moscow

military force the sr-7i use the same j-58 engine as the experimental interceptor previously announce but be substantially heavy and have a long range the considerably heavy gross weight permit to accommodate the multiple reconnaissance sensor need by the strategic|air|command to accomplish strategic reconnaissance mission in a military environment this|billion|dollar program be initiate in february|of|1963 the first operational aircraft will begin flight testing in early|1965 deployment of production unit to the strategic|air|command will begin shortly thereafter appropriate members of

increase from in to in an increase in this period from of more|than|18|percent think should comment briefly on a number of international problem first think most europeans know that the|united|states have never have any interest whatever in try to dominate europe or any other area of the world on the contrary the|united|state have constantly support the strengthening of the free nation of europe believe that europe and the|united|state have great common interest common purpose and common obligation so have never suppose that any european country would need to choose between tie to the|united|state and tie to europe believe that any effort to force such a choice would be bad for europe bad for the alliance and have find may say general agreement on this view in talk with prime minister home chancellor erhard president segni and many other european leader who have be here this|year should like to call attention to the excellent series of meeting which have have in washington this|last|week with the leader of australia new|zealand and malaysia these meeting have allow the|united|state to underscore support for the freedom and independence of most important pacific state and friendship and understanding with these government feel have be greatly strengthen third in the continue discussion of southeast|asia let state american policy once more be determined to support the freedom and the independence of south|viet nam where prime minister khanh and ambassador taylor have establish the close understanding with each other be in continual consultation and the policy of the nation be the same namely to increase the effectiveness of the whole program in that country political social economic and military be true that there be danger and provocation from the north and such provocation could force a response but be also true that the|united|states seek no wide war other friend suggest that this problem must be move to a conference table and indeed if other would keep the solemn agreement already sign at a conference table there would be no problem in south|viet nam if those who practice terror and ambush and murder will simply honor exist agreement there can easily be peace in southeast|asia immediately but do not believe in a conference call to ratify terror so policy be unchanged for and in different administration the|united|state have be commit to the freedom and the independence of south|viet nam help other to help in those|10|year have take whatever action be necessary send man and supply for different specific purpose at different time shall stick to that policy and shall continue effort to make even more effective shall do the same in support for the legitimate government|of|laos fourth this|week have confer with the foreign minister of this hemisphere at the|white|house and eye turn to latin|america down in mexico there have be a highly successful meeting of the|inter american|committee|on|the|alliance|for|progress the foreign minister be work here to meet a challenge to peace and freedom that meeting be still in session so must announce to that shall confine to the hope that in the spirit of the hemisphere a sound and believe an effective answer will be find these problem be not the only one that have to deal with in the world today there be many many other such as danger in cyprus and disturbance in the congo and difficulty in the|kennedy|round but still work for peace in cyprus and in the congo and for progress in the|kennedy|round be a steadfast people in the|united|state and in the large sense the world be less dangerous and be strong than be so work for peace must go on and will go on with success believe understand that have with today a group of journalist from latin|america who be here to cover the meeting of the foreign minister want to extend to a very cordial welcome now be ready to answer any question may have q. mr. president how do feel about the statement that have come from various official in new|york|city include the mayor and the deputy mayor to the general effect that there be indication of communist involvement in the recent racial violence in new|york|city and have receive any such evidence that would back up such indication the president receive detailed report at the close of each|day with regard to the investigation that have be carry on by of investigation do not care to comment in detail on those report until some conclusion have be reach and some recommendation make and until think be more appropriate to do so would not hesitate to say that the impression gain from read those report be that there be extremist element involve and at the appropriate time think that identity will be make known q. mr. president would comment on what hope or what feel may be accomplish in meeting with senator goldwater this|afternoon the president senator goldwater through the facility of office ask the legislative representative of the|white|house for an opportunity to meet with the president and on an unpublicized basis inform the white|house representative that would be glad to meet with senator goldwater have meet with senators every|day and would certainly be glad to meet with any time that think a meeting would be useful the arrangement today be make can not anticipate all the subject that will come up but be very glad to talk to and will try to be responsive and make the meeting as fruitful as possible q. mr. president in elaboration of statement on south|viet nam president de|gaulle yesterday call for france communist china the|soviet|union and the|united|stat all to get out of indochina and leave to settle problem would address to that proposal sir the president think have already do that point out that have already have conference and that would carry out the agreement reach at that conference table that there would be no need of presence there but until there be demonstrate upon the part of those who be ignore the agreement reach at the conference table some desire to carry out agreement expect to continue effort in viet nam q. mr. president after senator goldwater say last|week that if be president would give at least the nato commander more latitude in the utilization of nuclear weapon the|republican|convention reject an amendment to the platform restate the traditional civilian authority over the military what be reaction to these action and could give philosophy of civilian military relationship in this particular area of nuclear weapon the president well think there should be complete understanding and confidence in this country and among all friend abroad the control of nuclear weapon be of the most solemn responsibility of the president of the|united|state the man who be president can never get away from that responsibility and can never forget the american people rely on good judgment want that authority vest in a civilian do not expect to abandon this duty to military man in the field and do not think have ever seriously consider that since the founding fathers draft constitution give close and continual attention to maintain the most effective possible command and control over these awesome weapon believe that the final responsibility for all decision on nuclear weapon must rest with the civilian head of this government the president of the|united|state and think and reiterate that believe that be the way the american people want q. mr. president in view of the opposition that administration have show in the past to mr. tshombe how do plan to deal with now that have return and take over control of the|congolese|government the president be go to be as cooperative and as helpful as can in an attempt to see that the people of that area have as good a government as be possible and have every intention of be understanding and cooperative q. mr. president to go back to meeting with senator goldwater do and senator goldwater intend to enter into a pact to take the issue of civil right out of the campaign the president well would say to the architect of this meeting this|afternoon that do not believe that any issue which be before the people can be eliminate from the campaign in a free society in an|election|year after all that be the purpose of election be to discuss the issue if candidate differ on important question be up to the elector who must choose between and in order to be able to satisfactorily choose between must hear view now believe that all man and woman be entitle to full constitutional right regardless of ancestry or religion or the region of the country in which may live believe that dispute no matter how bitter should be settle in the court and not in the street make that statement many time in press conference and speech over the country in that be the reason that after third of the democrats in the congress approve the civil right bill and some|80|percent of the republicans in the senate support the civil right bill sign the civil right bill believe that all man and woman be entitle to equal opportunity so that can be judge accord to merit and not accord to some artificial barrier now to the extent that senator goldwater differ from these view or the|republican|party differ there will of course be discussion intend to carry on some of if be a candidate the test of a free society be that discuss and resolve these issue intelligently do not sweep under the rug when become difficult propose to discuss and debate the hard and difficult issue in the spirit of attempt to resolve and on the assumption that the american people be willing to listen and be intelligent and be unafraid no word or deed of mine that be aware of have ever or hope will ever lend any aid or any comfort to this small minority who would take the law into own hand for whatever cause or whatever excuse may use if senator goldwater and adviser and follower will follow the same course that intend to follow and that expect the|democratic|party to follow which be a course of rebuff and rebuke bigot and those who seek to excite and exploit tension then will be most welcome and think will be a very fine contribution to political life in america q. mr. president to return to the trouble in southeast asia for a moment-- the president can speak a little loud q. to return to statement in open statement on southeast asia do and the|defense|department foresee a possible withdrawal of military wife and child from saigon or other southeast asian command post in the foreseeable future the president no have no plan along that line over the|past|several|years have hear rumor to that effect and have see news story make prediction along that line but have no plan at the present time for any such action q. mr. president recently in san|francisco some rather rough language be direct at as be president by the republican opposition wonder if feel this may be some sort of a signal as to a rather rough campaign for the presidency that be come up the president most campaign be rough campaign be an old campaigner have be at of the first thing learn at least so far as be concern be the people be not much interested in personal opinion of opponent q. mr. president statement that the meeting with senator goldwater be to be unpublicized suggest that be unhappy at the publicity about be there any breach of faith by senator goldwater in announce that be go to meet the president well have ask question there first there be no such suggestion at all be not unhappy hope do not look unhappy do not feel unhappy do not know who suggest that to but the question be raise that be unpublicized and know the initiative and ingenuity of the american press do not think would be unpublicized very long just suggest that be rather difficult for a fellow to take a glass of water at the|white|house or even go out to the hydrant and get a drink without be adequately publicize can not even visit with dog without a lot of publicity so be not unhappy about at all just explain that think would be well to put on the record and so far as know senator goldwater be perfectly happy with there be no breach of faith on part and certainly none on part realize that someone may indicate because the suggestion in all entirety be not carry out there may be some difficulty between but object in life have always be to not provoke fight but to prevent if possible q. mr. president without regard to the inter - american conference now underway here take do not want to discuss the topic under negotiation but wonder if could tell what interpretation of the viewpoint of the american people be on the cuban problem and what should be do about the president think that viewpoint be the same as the viewpoint of government think generally speak that viewpoint be be consider by the foreign minister who be meet here now believe that all recognize the challenge to peace and freedom which exist and the necessity for not only be aware of that challenge but attempt to combat with every reasonable and wise mean available believe out of this meeting the hemisphere will find a sound and effective answer and think that there be some indication now that the policy that have pursue heretofore and the one that be suggest be follow now be be effective q. mr. president assume be not ready to name yet sir could describe for ideal running mate in term of characteristic and attribute the president the convention will meet in atlantic|city and select a candidate for president and nominate assume will make recommendation and then the delegate will act think that for to make any announcement at this time as to personal preference and have none have make no decision in the matter would be premature q. mr. president senator goldwater have say that will make an important issue out of what view as increase lawlessness and violence in the street of major city be willing to take this on as a campaign issue the president well be against sin and be against lawlessness and be very much opposed to violence think have to put a stop to to the extent that have the power to do so in the|federal|government be do so be exert every action know to keep violence to a minimum do not have a national police force in this country have not assume power that do not have and do not intend to but wherever there be violence respond to within the limit of power and authority do have confidence in the local authority do respect the sovereign states and the executive of those states have communicate with the mayor and the governors and have make available to all the facility of the|federal|government to cooperate with and work effectively with will continue to do so deplore man take the law into own hand and man disregard the law wherever take place treat all alike do not think there be any doubt in anyone 's mind in the|united|state that the president of the|united|state the power of the presidency and the people of the|united|state be go to do everything within power and within authority to stop violence wherever appear but judgement be that be not up to to take over the authority of all the local government and not up to to take over the authority of all the state government seem to have read and hear that other people too be oppose to the|federal|government usurp the right of the states q. mr. president be there difference of opinion between the|united|state and south|vietnamese official on the question of attack north|viet nam and if there be difference what be please the president the answer be no state that earlier but repeat q. mr. president how do assess opponent this|november barry|goldwater and do anticipate a close race the president think what think about senator goldwater and prediction as to the outcome of the race be not very important think that be a matter for the american people to decide think what the people want to know be how stand on issue and what policy will be and what party stand for be much more interested in what the democratic nominee advocate than what think about opponent or chance of win have every confidence that the|democratic|party will adopt a good platform will select good candidate and that will present view to the people without regard to personality and the people in wisdom will make a good decision q. mr. president about|10|days|ago senator goldwater use some very strong personal epithet to challenge own sincerity of purpose in the civil right issue now would sit down this|afternoon to discuss civil right without clear that matter up first the president yes yes be not concerned with senator goldwater 's opinion of of course would like for to be a good opinion but if be not that be a matter for be entitle to view and have the right to express if think be a proper thing to do and a wise thing to do the american people will make judgment of the various statement that may make from time to time be perfectly willing to leave opinion of to the judgment of the people of this country q. mr. president could give assessment of the effect governor wallace 's withdrawal from the presidential race will have the president have be rather busily engage the|last|few|day and have not spend a great deal of time evaluate that situation do not know how much support governor wallace have do not know how would affect the platform and the nominee of the party all know be that decide to withdraw have hear and anticipate that would do that confirm but what effect will have in november do not know q. mr. president how active a campaign do plan to conduct this|fall the president whatever think be wise and necessary and expect to appear in various part of the country and be very concerned with see that party and platform and the view of candidate be properly present will make whatever contribution can consistent with discharge other duty and try to be as helpful to the ticket as possible at all time q. mr. president can tell if plan any further action any further federal action in new|york|city and can give some elaboration of what mean by extremist element involve in the disorder the president no say that get report from there every|evening do not think there be any question but what there be some extremist element involve in the violence that take place there think that must be evident to everyone who read the newspaper so far as be concern be prepared to take whatever action may be necessary and desirable have mr. hoover keep very close watch on have an adequate supply of manpower available to have assign on specific investigation at the moment and will follow very closely and do whatever need to be do q. mr. president in present view this fall and discuss the issue that want to present would be willing to debate senator goldwater on television the president well will cross that bridge when get to q. mr. president sir there have be the claim in the campaign of an across the board attack on the foreign policy of the|united|state during recent|years this have raise question here and abroad as to whether this wholesale kind of attack could cause administration to trim foreign policy in any major way could answer these question sir the president think foreign policy be an appropriate subject for discussion think the people of this country really need no advice from anyone else in other part of the world about the decision should make but think will certainly want to be sure that the foreign policy of country be a proper one and be prepared to present the view of party on that subject and will do so at such time and at such length as may be desirable q. mr. president sir in response to an early question say hope neither candidate 's word or deed would encourage extremist do feel that anything senator goldwater have say of late would encourage extremist the president will leave that up to the judgment of the people and do not want to be pass personal judgment on the act of another individual have give viewpoint on that be a little mission will have to do for q. mr. president would give reaction please to the attack that be make on senator goldwater by foreign official in the foreign press the president think that the american people be perfectly capable of make own decision with regard to the party and the candidate and think that will do that without the necessity of advice from anyone abroad thank mr. president & nbsp & nbsp view transcript transcript fellow americans be about to sign into law of want to take this occasion to talk to about what that law mean to

tactic in the civil right struggle the president think that have a civil right bill pende in the senate that have pass the house be very important that bill be pass at the early possible date think passage of that bill will be helpful in this general situation do not of course condone violence or take the law into own hand or threaten the health or safety of people really do the civil right cause no good when go to this extent but be hopeful that all americans understand that be go to pass the civil right bill because be morally right and because feel that these people have too long be deny right on the other hand do not think the violation of right or the denial of right should permit the violation of another right q. mr. president there have be some conflicting high level statement over the|last|week about strength militarily as compare with russia 's particularly in the field of missile and air power would give own appraisal of that the president yes be pleased with strength think have make great gain during the|last|3|years when realize that each|year during have spend approximately|$6|billion more on military budget than be spend the|last|year of the eisenhower

be pleased with those accomplishment under the law the secretary of defense mr. mcnamara be charge with the leadership and the direction of the|defense|department while operate a tight budget think operate an adequate think work have be constructive have confidence in the congress have confidence in believe the american people have confidence in can depend on what tell q. mr. president what do see in the future and particularly in the near future in the field of soviet american trade and in particular do see another major development in the wake of the wheat sale the president no do not anticipate another major development at this time be encourage by the fact that there be approach be make to purchase some thing from country and the foreign relations|committee|of the senate be now have hearing and give study to the possibility of increase east west trade but so far as anticipate just the extent of that trade and in what line will be be not able to say q. mr. president in connection with the railroad situation have emphasize the value of free collective bargaining and at the same time have in this case bring the very considerable weight of the presidency to bear in influence the action by postpone a strike do have some general guideline as to where the public interest in prevent strike come up against the public interest in the freedom to bargain the president think that this be a matter that the mediator and the negotiator represent each side will attempt to evolve and find an agreeable ground and a common solution be not an overly optimistic man but do believe that under collective bargaining system a result can be reach hope and pray that will be by the|end|of|the|week q. mr. president a group of newspaper editor many of whom be in this room now be poll as to chance for win in all agree that would win be a matter of how much would win by would care to comment on that sir the president no hope that feel in november as do in april q. mr. president of the member of the seato military organization have take a strong stand on support for south|viet nam the eighth member france have reservation on this do believe that this impair the effectiveness of that organization or policy in south|viet nam the president of course would have prefer the decision to be unanimous and would have like for friend and ally france to have see the situation as do the other member of seato be very pleased however that of see thing alike have a definite policy in viet nam know what that policy be think be the good policy that could be derive from the alternative open to and be very pleased and happy that secretary rusk find that at|least|seven signatory of seato be willing to go along with q. mr. president after nearly|5|month in office wonder if could assess for whether find the task more or less difficult than have anticipate the president well do not do a great deal of anticipate prior to november on just how difficult the task would be but enjoy there be a lot of work connect with nearly everyone be anxious to help do that job most people be hope and pray that do a good job and a very few people have call on that have not be willing to put shoulder to the wheel and help be probably more difficult than expect would be but be enjoy and be prepared to continue q. mr. president there have be considerable talk in the press and in congress relative to the|lbj|company ktbc own by mrs. johnson and relative to a secret option agreement the fcc have ask that that option agreement be make available wonder what view be on that if feel be proper that not be disclose also would like to know how feel about the general ethical question that have be raise relative to high governmental official whether in the executive branch or the legislative who have interest in government regulate industry such as television the president well first do not have any interest in government regulate industry of any kind and never have have own no stock own a little ranch land something in excess of the commission have make no request of or of family for anything be perfectly willing to comply be sure the trustee would be with any request that do make there be not anything that have to secrete in any manner shape or form mrs. johnson inherit some property invest that property in the profession of choice and work at with pleasure and satisfaction until force to leave when assume the presidency as know and want all to know all of that stock have be place in trust as have be the practice with other president and although own none of mrs. johnson have place in trust an irrevocable trust that can the property can be dispose of can be lease can be sell at any time any of those decision would still require the action of the commission even if try to sell would have to have approval but see no conflict in any way participate in no decision the company make be entirely with the trustee in any event if do participate the president would not have anything to do with q. as know now have a record number of military and diplomatic dependent abroad well over in concern for the american image and admirable desire to improve the status of woman do not think would be worth the expense to provide language course for these wife before go overseas the president think be always desirable for anyone to acquire as much knowledge of language as possible have not give any study to the particular suggestion make seem to be a good one and will have explore q. mr. president in recent|months the air force and certain member of congress have say that be desirable for the|united|state to develop a new man strategic bomber secretary of defense mcnamara maintain that be not wonder if could give opinion sir the president at the moment would not make a judgment because that decision will likely come to in the near future when the|joint|chiefs|of|staff present military recommendation to at the early part of the|year be together on all of the recommendation with the exception that general lemay ask for the privilege of take fund already calculate in budget and use to study plan for a new bomber tell would give consideration to proposal understand that proposal have be formulate and be now go through channel and will shortly come to the president when get to will study as best can and make the decision that think be in the national interest q. mr. president to go back to politic the late president kennedy in look ahead to the election use to say that expect a hard close fight would say sir how look to this far ahead of the event the president would think that be a very accurate appraisal of and would think will be a hard fight a difficult would hope that would not be too close but may be do not think that can ever tell this far in advance how people be go to decide the choice but have no doubt but what will be a hard and long fight q. mr. president there have be a new factor inject into the civil right situation mr. president there have be allusion here today to difficulty of extremist action on the part of civil right leader but there seem also to be a possibility of extreme action on the part of some white people who be mightily oppose both north|and|south not only to the bill but to further progress for negroes would assess this new factor and do have any counsel to the people on that end of the battle the president yes would counsel moderation to all group and understanding of fellowman and try to appreciate position think if people would put in the other fellow 's position will all be a little more tolerant of the other man 's viewpoint there be people who feel very strongly on both side of this issue find that in the bill find in the bill in take many day and night to try to find an area of agreement that the members of congress and the president would accept expect that there will be many|days|ahead when strong force on both side will be appeal to people to side with only hope that recognize that have be since abraham|lincoln free the slave of chain but have not free all of the people of the bigotry that exist have be since president lincoln sign but a great many people do not have equal right as of now while emancipation may be a proclamation be not a fact until education be blind to color until employment be unaware of race as long as those condition exist in the country be go to have protest and be entitle to protest and petition under constitutional right hope though that the congress will act promptly with reasonable dispatch to bring those protest and bring those petition and bring these disturbance from the street and the alley into the court where belong in order to do that need a good civil right bill and the bill now pende in the senate be a good bill hope can be pass in a reasonable time q. mr. president could list for the pende legislative measure which consider essential that the congress enact before adjourn finally this|summer the president well that would take more time than have but there be some that be vitally interested in have just name the civil right bill that be pende in the senate have difficulty in the|house|judiciary|committee spend a long time there then the|house|rules|committee file a petition and a good many member sign that to discharge the bill and finally the|rules|committee pass be now in the senate and have be debate a good while there so that be a very important piece of legislation for the national welfare because be go to have many problem even after be pass adjust to ought to get pass as early as can so that before school begin next|year will have this law on the book and can move ahead think be as important that pass the food stamp plan in the senate as the civil right bill pass in the house by a good vote the|other|day be very important not only to the consumer of this country but to the producer of this country and to the business people of this country be a good piece of legislation be soundly conceive hope that can get action in the|agriculture|committee|of|the|senate in a short time perhaps as soon as the civil right bill be out of the way can pass the food stamp bill the pay bill be of the most important piece of legislation to continue good government in this country have on desk today a number of resignation from some of the very good man in government who tell that just can not stay any longer have be here and can not stay any longer at present salary man say have have to borrow another one say have have to borrow another and just do not feel could go on do that if the pay bill be not go to be pass think that be go to lose some of the good man in the government like sergeant that run the army some of the under secretaries and assistant secretaries and the man who do not get the notoriety but do the hard work from day to day be entitle to a raise hope the congress will consider the bill in both committee although have take vote on in the house that can make some adjustment to meet the objection of the members and pass the pay bill think the medicare bill be an extremely important bill that will provide medical care for old people aged people under social security believe that be close to have enough vote to report that bill from the committee if can make adjustment and modification to get that bill report and pass and have medicare under social security would be a great day for the people of country nearly every home have some father or mother or uncle or aunt or some member of family that find need for medical care insurance too many of do not have and never will have under the present system have think the poverty bill be very important all the cabinet members have testify on secretary mcnamara the attorney general the secretary of labor the secretary of health,|education and welfare the secretary of agriculture be all united think that be a comprehensive bill and have very sound principle will do a lot to help with juvenile delinquency problem will take boy off the street and out of the alley and out of the pool room will make possible for to train and educate people for national service that be now be turn back by the draft think that bill be soundly conceive and very important so would list just those four|or|five the pay bill the poverty bill the medicare bill the civil right bill the food stamp bill as should hope would be pass before the convention q. mr. president sir wonder what think about some of columnist and fellow correspondent who have be write declassify material give to obviously by some officer in the|national|security|council and in the pentagon refer to the material about macarthur and command in korea be sure that be necessary to classify this material but wonder why be declassify at this time for just certain one the president raise that question with the pentagon today at lunch and tell be unaware of any of the material relate to general macarthur that have not already be publish in book prior to the recent revelation q. mr. president sir in the light of unequivocal stand on civil right be concerned about the election in november of independent elector in the|southern|state that would be commit to vote neither for nor for republican opponent the president yes would always be concern about any elector that be not commit to vote for if be a candidate and would do good to convince of the error of way do not anticipate however that there will be any substantial number that will feel that the future of this country should be place in the hand of independent elector but think most of will be associate with of the regular party and q. mr. president since the maryland presidential primary be not exactly a contest between maryland democrats do not think may say something or do something to try to affect that result the president give serious consideration to what policy should be in connection with primary generally speak there could be an exception but generally speak think be unwise for to interfere in primary or attempt to influence people in primary in connection with the presidential primary this|year which be much more specific than previous statement which apply to all primary give think to what course of conduct should be and conclude that would not enter any primary would do the very good job could as president for all the people up until convention time and then let the delegate at the convention make choice freely then conduct would be determine after make choice thank mr. president & nbsp & nbsp view transcript transcript the

be no to both of question q. mr. president in connection with announcement concern various disease since the|u.s.|public|health|service have so strongly condemn the use of tobacco as a health hazard do see any justification at all for continued government subsidy to tobacco grower the president do not think that the report have be make a government report as yet understand this committee be appoint by the|surgeon|general with the understanding that when make recommendation that report would be submit to all the department of government concern and that would be the second procedure follow in turn would carefully digest and study recommendation and then make the recommendation back to the secretary of health,|education and welfare the government agency concern be now make that study and in due time will make recommendation q. mr. president believe say early in administration that be not consider any trip overseas before election time have there be any change in thinking on that the president no q. mr. president say earlier that have be in communication with president de|gaulle without ask sir for any of the detail of those private communication could say sir whether the|united|state and france have exchange general view about policy in southeast|asia the president be aware of no detailed plan that general de|gaulle have concern southeast|asia government have

to a group of senior citizen about medicare make this statement be go to try to take all of the money that think be unnecessarily be spend and take from the have and give to the have not that need so much just wonder if could elaborate sir the president think that explain have take about|$3|billion out of the budget as constitute last|year reduce that budget by about|$3|billion by cut out of defense almost|$r|billion out of agriculture and almost|$100|million out of the|post|office out of atomic|energy and so forth reduce now think that all of those reduction could be make have appropriation for last|year be not ask for appropriation for this|year so will save there but be ask for an|additional|$2|billion to be put in the budget roughly that be extra interest rate on the public debt for space that be a then have the poverty program and the appalachia program roughly a half dollar extra for education for urban renewal for public housing and expect those program to have money this|year take from those program that do not ask for money that have last|year expect the total budget to be a little less than less than the kennedy budget of last|year now that be possible think because be spend on defense need during of the kennedy administration that do not think be essential today while the population have be increase between and budget have be increase approximately|5|percent or per year this|year instead of increase be go to be reduce this|year instead of deficit be be go to be less|than|$5|billion that mean that this|year deficit will be reduce by more|than|5 ° have a provision in budget for contingency for any possible supplemental hope that that will not be necessary but have provide for be determined and this administration be dedicated to see to that live within the budget send to congress as tell now will have another quarterly report april|10th and hope can further reduce budget ceiling at that time q. mr. president go back to an

would indicate large scale and more organized campaign will this development affect in any way plan to withdraw american troop gradually and turn over more of the fighting to the south|vietnamese the president do not think that the american public have fully understand the reason for withdraw any adviser from south|viet nam and think should have call back approximately|1,000 people a good many of those people several|hundred be there training guard policeman once those people be train feel that could act as policeman as well as people could act so withdraw those people from time to time as training mission be complete other people will be withdraw from time to time as additional adviser be need or as people to train additional vietnamese be need will send out there but see no reason to

when report be in will carefully evaluate and if additional man be need will send if other have complete mission will withdraw but because withdraw some mp 's from saigon who have train people to take place there be no indication that be not still just as interested in south|viet nam as have always be q. mr. president in view of the economic picture describe at the beginning of this conference and the british action in raise interest rate do see any prospect of american interest rate go up this|year the president be hope that that will not be necessary believe be unlikely can not speak for the

available in ample quantity at reasonable interest rate to see new investment take place and new facility build that will employ additional people q. mr. president can tell in what capacity believe

foresee a situation in the relatively near future where may recommend or accept the admission of red|china into the|united|nation the president no do not q. mr. president sir wonder what think about a full time senate employee or an employee of any government agency who would get involved on off duty hour or in regular|hour with consultant for defense contracting firm of the government with building motel get involve in deal with mortgage company that be interested in pende legislation and in visit the|dominican|republic and talk to about buy u.s. fighter plane by way of sweden do think this be the proper conduct for any government employee the president the senate committee be now make a study of the accuracy of some of the allegation that have make will in wisdom determine the accuracy of those allegation and be sure render proper judgment q. mr. president many of be wonder why would hold a news conference in a cramped little room such as this limit to about|90 newsman when have facility available to accommodate all newsman such as at the|state|department the president do not have an answer to that question of think that this would be ample to take care of need be sorry if find yourself uncomfortable be much more convenient to come here at the time that could come and be attempt to satisfy the newsman be somewhat difficult to do sometimes but want a news conference this|week and think this be the appropriate place and could be best handle here q. mr. president although seem a little early as a result of the republican fund raise dinner on apparently consider open season on do have any favorite opponent among the one mention prominently to run against next term and do think will be a hand off pretty rough political type campaign between and that opponent the president no do not have any favorite opponent be not duty to select opposition think that the delegate to the|republican|convention will act wisely and select the good man that be available to and so far as be concern hope to keep as free from politic as can as long as can because think be in the interest of the continuity and transition of this administration and the unity of the country to keep free from mudslinge and petty politic and get into any political battle have ask the democrats to refrain from indulge in any personality if at all possible will have debate about principle and expect difference of opinion do not want to suppress or silence but find in that serve as democratic leader under president eisenhower that be not necessary to sle mud or to indulge in personality and hope that democratic people will follow that course what the republicans do be a matter for to determine in wisdom q. mr. president speak of view these foreign problem in the perspective of history rather than today 's headline look at the problem of viet nam that way how do look what do see down the road be this a situation that can be settle in a military way do rule out any neutralization such as general de|gaulle suggest or what be general perspective on viet nam the president if could have neutralization of both north|viet nam and south|viet nam be sure that would be consider sympathetically but see no indication of that at the moment think that if could expect the|viet|cong to let neighbor live in peace could take a much different attitude but as long as these raid be continue and people be attempt to envelop south|viet nam think that the present course be conduct be the only answer to that course and think that the operation should be step up there see no sentiment favor neutralization of south|viet nam alone and think the course that be follow be the most advisable for freedom at this point q. mr. president can give some idea of how expect to participate in the choice of own running mate whether will make personal choice know to the convention and what some of the factor be that would weigh in the selection the president would think that would be premature and somewhat presumptuous at this point for to go into any detailed discussion on the selection of a vice president think that if be nominate by the convention select as standard bearer recommendation will likely be seek and if so will be glad to give and at that time will cross that bridge hope that can act wisely and in the good interest of the american people q. mr. president have have the opportunity yet to study and make a personal decision on the rather bitter debate dispute rather between secretary mcnamara and in the congress over the atomic power plant for the carrier the president no feel that have not go into the detail of the fight be aware of the issue concur in the judgment that secretary mcnamara have make think that be look far into the future and that those judgment be always susceptible to error but at this moment would conclude that decision have be a reasonable and a fair and in which agree q. mr. president a part question on legislation how confident be that main piece of legislation of top priority namely the tax cut and civil right be actually go ahead to become legislation that be satisfactory to and secondly what be the piece of legislation beneath those that consider of importance as well for instance be medical care virtually in the same order of priority the president the answer to first question be that think that in the|60|day that have hold this office have make great progress in legislation when come into have go along down the road with educational bill but finally consummate and think have the good educational congress in the history of the republic have or appropriation bill out of pass conclude action on those during this period of time have report the civil right bill from the|rules|committee and be now be debate in the house hope and believe that will be pass without any crippling amendment think should be pass without any crippling amendment think that due progress be be make there hope be act upon in the house before the members leave to attend lincoln|day birthday meeting throughout the nation because would be a great tribute to president lincoln to have that bill finally act upon in the house before go out to celebrate birthday on the tax bill have be before the congress now for almost|13|month the senate have report the senate committee have report to the senate be be debate there there be some technical amendment and there will be dozen of other amendment will be carefully deliberate but hope that can pass before take a recess for lincoln 's birthday on february|12 be pleased with the progress make on both of those bill hope the tax bill can withstand the onslaught that will be make by many in attempt to amend in the|next|few|day and then will go to conference and would like to see report from conference as nearly to the administration 's recommendation as possible because before those recommendation be submit to congress participate in formulation and embrace now there be other important item have a good many item in the national resource legislation field like the wilderness bill and other have a good many measure must pass in the agricultural field farm legislation which consider very important consider medical care a very important measure and have already talk to the chairman of the|ways|and|means|committee about have talk to lead republicans who have a substitute plan that have propose which be now study and give some thought to try to determine the merit of but hope that can pass a medicare bill out of the|house|ways|and|means|committee and through the congress this|year base on the social security principle can think of no single piece of legislation that would be happy to approve than that bill the housing legislation could spend most of this time tell how important think be be of the most comprehensive bill in the history of the nation hope that can work toward the goal of someday every american own home think that this message go in that direction have review carefully both at the ranch and here in washington with administrator|weaver will start hearing on very shortly in both body be extremely important think that have an administration program that be go to be difficult to enact before the convention but with cooperation from all people on both side of the aisle hope will attain a major part of to second question would say that do put medical care high on the priority list q. mr. president do general de|gaulle 's proposal for neutralize southeast|asia interfere with objective there or make work there more difficult than would be otherwise the president yes do not agree with general de|gaulle 's proposal do not think that would be in the interest of freedom to share view general de|gaulle be entitle to opinion have express have express ours think the course of action that be follow in southeast|asia be the only course for to follow and the most advisable at this time plan to pursue diligently and hope successfully on a step up basis q. mr. president two|days|ago when prime minister pearson of canada be in washington express the position that before long russia would agree to a total nuclear test ban to include underground test do share this optimism and also be optimistic that some meaningful disarmament agreement will come out of the present geneva conference the president would rather not express in term of optimism or pessimism would rather say that should be the goal of every leader in the world today to try to find area of agreement that will lead to disarmament be seriously dedicatedly do very good and try to initiate and develop every conceivable fresh proposal can that will lead to that end q. mr. president do anticipate a filibuster when the civil right bill eventually reach the senate do think in order to pass in the senate the bill will have to be substantially trim the president no do not think will have to be substantially trim and yes do expect a filibuster q. mr. president thursday in the|rules|committee an amendment be offer to include woman in the ban on discrimination in the civil right bill on the basis of race religion or national origin that be defeat by vote and will be bring up again on the floor of the house now in the democratic platform say and if may read just a few support legislation which will guarantee to woman equality of right under the law would support an amendment to include woman in the civil right bill the president support that platform and embrace that platform and state that view in 43|states in the union realize there have be discrimination in the employment of woman and be do good to do something about be hopeful that in the|next|month will have make substantial advance in that field q. mr. president do feel that mr. walter|jenkins should go up to the capitol and testify under oath to clear up the conflict that be appear in the testimony the president the general question be raise with at last meeting speak with candor and frankness on that subject about all know about say then that do not plan to make any more statement on and do not q. mr. president could elaborate sir on statement that may look with some sympathy on the neutralization of both south|viet nam and north|viet nam how do this differ from president de|gaulle 's idea the president well will have to ask general de|gaulle about the detail of proposal but as understand the neutralization talk have apply only to south|viet nam and not to the whole of that area of the world think that the only thing need to do to have complete peace in that area of the world now be to stop the invasion of south|viet nam by some of neighbor and supporter q. mr. president some of adviser have different view as to the proper strategy to follow in the war on poverty some think the program should emphasize a welfare aspect some think an education aspect some think job creation which of those general area do think the program should focus on the president on all of and be unaware of any difference among adviser in that field have a group from the cabinet that have give considerable attention to that and be now develop recommendation those recommendation will be contain in a message but answer to question be first know of no disagreement among adviser think the message will emphasize all area that message be be very carefully work out and will be coordinate with all of the adviser who have responsibility in those field expect to get through the regular appropriation bill in excess of a|half|billion|dollar to be

afford to stand still population be grow economy be more complex people 's need be expand but by close down obsolete installation by curtail less urgent program by cut back where cut back seem to be wise by insist on a dollar 's worth for a dollar spend be able to recommend in this reduced budget the most federal support in history for education for health for retrain the unemployed and for help the economically and the physically handicapped this budget and this year 's legislative program be design to help each and every american citizen fulfill basic hope hope for a fair chance to make good hope for fair play from the law hope for a full time job on full time pay hope for a decent home for family in a decent community hope for a good school for child with good teacher and hope for security when face with sickness or unemployment or old age unfortunately many americans live on the outskirt of hope some because of poverty and some because of theft color and all too many because of both task be to help replace despair with opportunity this administration today here and now declare unconditional war on poverty in america urge this congress and all americans to join with in that effort will not be a short or easy struggle no single weapon or strategy will suffice but shall not rest until that war be win the rich nation on earth can afford to win can not afford to lose one|thousand|dollar invest in salvage an unemployable youth today can return or more in lifetime poverty be a national problem require improve national organization and support but this attack to be effective must also be organize at the state and the local level and must be support and direct by state and local effort for the war against poverty will not be win here in washington must be win in the field in every private home in every public office from the courthouse to the|white|house the program shall propose will emphasize this cooperative approach to help that fifth of all american family with income too small to even meet basic need chief weapon in a more pinpointed attack will be well school and well health and well home and well training and well job opportunity to help more americans especially young americans escape from squalor and misery and unemployment roll where other citizen help to carry very often a lack of job and money be not the cause of poverty but the symptom the cause may lie deep in failure to give fellow citizen a fair chance to develop own capacity in a lack of education and training in a lack of medical care and housing in a lack of decent community in which to live and bring up child but whatever the cause joint federal local effort must pursue poverty pursue wherever exist in city slum and small town in sharecropper shack or in migrant worker camp on indian reservations among white as well as negroes among the young as well as the aged in the boom town and in the depressed area aim be not only to relieve the symptom of poverty but to cure and above all to prevent no single piece of legislation however be go to suffice will launch a special effort in the chronically distressed area of appalachia must expand small but successful area redevelopment program must enact youth employment legislation to put jobless aimless hopeless youngster to work on useful project must distribute more food to the needy through a broad food stamp program must create a national service corps to help the economically handicapped of own country as the|peace|corp now help those abroad must modernize unemployment insurance and establish a high level commission on automation if have the brain power to invent these machine have the brain power to make certain that be a boon and not a bane to humanity must extend the coverage of minimum wage law to more|than|two|million worker now lack this basic protection of purchase power must by include special school aid fund as part of education program improve the quality of teaching training and counseling in hard hit area must build more library in every area and more hospital and nursing home under the hill burton act and train more nurse to staff must provide hospital insurance for old citizen finance by every worker and employer under social|security contribute no|more|than|$1 a month during the employee 's working career to protect in old age in a dignified manner without cost to the treasury against the devastating hardship of prolong or repeat illness must as a part of a revise housing and urban renewal program give more help to those displace by slum clearance provide more housing for poor and elderly and seek as ultimate goal in free enterprise system a decent home for every american family must help obtain more modern mass transit within community as well as low cost transportation between above all must release of tax reduction into the private spending stream to create new job and new market in every area of this land these program be obviously not for the poor or the underprivileged alone every american will benefit by the extension of social security to cover the hospital cost of aged parent every american community will benefit from the construction or modernization of school library hospital and nursing home from the training of more nurse and from the improvement of urban renewal in public transit and every individual american taxpayer and every corporate taxpayer will benefit from the early possible passage of the pende tax bill from both the new investment will bring and the new job that will create that tax bill have be thoroughly discuss for a|year now need action the new budget clearly allow taxpayer surely deserve economy strongly demand and every|month of delay dilute benefit in for consumption for investment and for employment for until the bill be sign investment incentive can not be deem certain and the withholding rate can not be reduce and the most damaging and devastating thing can do to any businessman in america be to keep in doubt and to keep guess on what tax policy be and say that should now reduce to instead of withholding rate therefore urge the congress to take final action on this bill by the|first|of|february if at all possible for however proud may be of the unprecedented progress of free enterprise economy over should not and can not permit to pause in for the first time in history cross the 70-million job mark but will soon need more|than|75|million job in gross national product reach the high than when take office but easily could and should be still high today than be wage and profit and family income be also at high level in history but would remind that four|million worker and of industrial capacity be still idle today need a tax cut now to keep this country move for goal be not merely to spread the work goal be to create more job believe the enactment of a 35-hour week would sharply increase cost would invite inflation would impair ability to compete and merely share instead of create employment but be equally opposed to the or 50-hour week in those industry where consistently excessive use of overtime cause increase unemployment so therefore recommend legislation authorize the creation of a tripartite industry committee to determine on an industry by industry basis as to where a high penalty rate for overtime would increase job opening without unduly increase cost and authorize the establishment of such high rate let make principle of this administration abundantly clear all of these increase opportunity in employment in education in housing and in every field must be open to americans of every color as far as the writ of federal law will run must abolish not some but all racial discrimination for this be not merely an economic issue or a social political or international issue be a moral issue and must be meet by the passage this session of the bill now pende in the house all member of the public should have equal access to facility open to the public all member of the public should be equally eligible for federal benefit that be finance by the public all member of the public should have an equal chance to vote for public official and to send child to good public school and to contribute talent to the public good today americans of all race stand side by side in berlin and in vietnam die side by side in korea surely can work and eat and travel side by side in own country must also lift by legislation the bar of discrimination against those who seek entry into country particularly those who have much need skill and those join family in establish preference a nation that be build by the immigrant of all land can ask those who now seek admission what can do for country but should not be ask in what country be bear for ultimate goal be a world without war a world make safe for diversity in which all man good and idea can freely move across every border and every boundary must advance toward this goal in in different way not as partisan but as patriot first must maintain — and reduced defense budget will maintain — that margin of military safety and superiority obtain through three|year of

outright aggression or by the infiltration practice by those in hanoi and havana who ship arm and man across international border to foment insurrection and must continue to use that strength as john|kennedy use in the cuban crisis and for the test ban treaty to demonstrate both the futility of nuclear war and the possibility of last peace second must take new step and shall make new proposal at geneva — toward the control and the eventual abolition of arm even in the absence of agreement must not stockpile arm beyond need or seek an excess of military power that could be provocative as

this college and also mean so much to art and the progress of the|united|state this college be part of the|united|state belong to so do mr. frost in a large sense and therefore be privilege to accept the invitation somewhat render to in the same way that franklin|roosevelt render invitation to mr. macleish the invitation which receive from mr. mccloy the power of the presidency be often describe limitation should occasionally be remember and therefore when the chairman of disarmament|advisory|committee who have labor so long and hard governor stevenson 's assistant during the|very|difficult|days at the|united|nation during the cuban crisis a public servant of so|many|year ask or invite the president of the|united|state there be only|one response so be glad to be here amherst have have many soldier of the king since first and some of be here today mr. mccloy who have long be a public servant jim|reed who be the assistant secretary of the treasury president cole who be now ambassador to chile mr. ramey who be a commissioner of the|atomic|energy|commission dick|reuter who be head of these and score of other down through the|year have recognize the obligation of the advantage which the graduation from a college such as this place upon to serve not only private interest but the public interest as well many|years|ago woodrow|wilson say what good be a political party unless be serve a great national purpose and what good be a private college or university unless be serve a great national purpose the library be construct today this college — all of this of course be not do merely to give this school 's graduate an advantage an economic advantage in the life struggle do do that but in return for that in return for the great opportunity which society give the graduate of this and related school seem to incumbent upon this and other school ' graduate to recognize responsibility to the public interest privilege be here and with privilege go responsibility and think as president say that must be a source of satisfaction to that this school 's graduate have recognize hope that the student who be here now will also recognize in the future although amherst have be in the forefront of extend aid to needy and talented student private college take as a whole draw of student from the wealthy of nation and even state university and other public institution derive of student from this group in march|1962 person of who have not complete high school make up of the total labor force and such person comprise of those who be unemployed and in the low fifth of the family in the|united|state have of the total personal income the high fifth there be inherit wealth in this country and also inherit poverty and unless the graduate of this college and other college like who be give a running start in life unless be willing to put back into society those talent the broad sympathy the understanding the compassion unless be willing to put those quality back into the service of the|great|republic then obviously the presupposition upon which democracy be base be bind to be fallible the problem which this country now face be staggering both at home and abroad need the service in the great sense of every educate man or woman to find job in the|next|21/2|years to govern relation a country which live in isolation for and be now suddenly the leader of the free world to govern relation with over country to govern those relation with success so that the balance of power remain strong on the side of freedom to make possible for americans of all different race and creed to live together in harmony to make possible for a world to exist in diversity and freedom all this require the good of all of therefore be proud to come to this college whose graduate have recognize this obligation and to say to those who be now here that the need be endless and be confident that will respond robert|frost say road diverge in a wood and i— take the one less travel by and that have make all the difference hope that road will not be the less travel by and hope commitment to the|great|republic 's interest in the|year to come will be worthy of long inheritance since beginning this|day devoted to the memory of robert|frost offer an opportunity for reflection which be prize by politician as well as by other and even by poet for robert|frost be of the granite figure of time in america be supremely thing an artist and an american a nation reveal not only by the man produce but also by the man honor the man remember in america hero have customarily run to man of large accomplishment but today this college and country honor a man whose contribution be not to size but to spirit not to political belief but to insight not to self esteem but to self comprehension in honor robert|frost therefore can pay honor to the deep source of national strength that strength take many form and the most obvious form be not always the most significant the man who create power make an indispensable contribution to the nation 's greatness but the man who question power make a contribution just as dispensable especially when that questioning be disintereste for determine whether use power or power use national strength matter but the spirit which inform and control strength matter just as much this be the special significance of robert|frost bring an unsparing instinct for reality to bear on the platitude and piety of society sense of the human tragedy fortify against self deception and easy consolation have be write acquaint with the night and because know the midnight as well as the|high|noon because understand the ordeal as well as the triumph of the human spirit give age strength with which to overcome despair at bottom hold a deep faith in the spirit of man and be hardly an accident that robert|frost couple poetry and power for see poetry as the mean of save power from when power lead man towards arrogance poetry remind of limitation when power narrow the area of man 's concern poetry remind of the richness and diversity of existence when power corrupt poetry cleanse for art establish the basic human truth which must serve as the touchstone of judgment the artist however faithful to personal vision of reality become the last champion of the individual mind and sensibility against an intrusive society and an officious state the great artist be thus a solitary figure have as frost say a lover 's quarrel with the world in pursue perception of reality must often sail against the current of time this be not a popular role if robert|frost be much honor during lifetime be because a good many prefer to ignore dark truth yet in retrospect see how the artist 's fidelity have strengthen the fibre of national life if sometimes great artist have be the most critical of society be because sensitivity and concern for justice which must motivate any true artist make aware that nation fail short of high potential see little of more importance to the future of country and civilization than full recognition of the place of the artist if art be to nourish the root of culture society must set the artist free to follow vision wherever take must never forget that art be not a form of propaganda be a form of truth and as mr. macleish once remark of poet there be nothing bad for trade than to be in style in free society art be not a weapon and do not belong to the sphere of polemic and ideology artist be not engineer of the soul may be different elsewhere but democratic society in the high duty of the writer the composer the artist be to remain true to and to let the chip fall where may in serve vision of the truth the artist good serve nation and the nation which disdain the mission of art invite the fate of robert|frost 's hire man the fate of have nothing to look backward to with pride and nothing to look forward to with hope look forward to a great future for america a future in which country will match military strength with moral restraint wealth with wisdom power with purpose look forward to an america which will not be afraid of grace and beauty which will protect the beauty of natural environment which will preserve the great old american house and square and park of national past and which will build handsome and balanced city for future look forward to an america which will reward achievement in the art as reward achievement in business or statecraft look forward to an america which will steadily raise the standard of artistic accomplishment and which will steadily enlarge cultural opportunity for all of citizen and look forward to an america which command respect throughout the world not only for strength but for civilization as well and look forward to a world which will be safe not only for democracy and diversity but also for personal distinction robert|frost be often skeptical about project for human improvement yet do not think would disdain this hope as write during the|uncertain|days of the second war take human nature altogether since time begin and must be a little more in favor of man say a fraction of one|percent at the very least hold on the planet would not have so increase because of mr. frost 's life and work because of the life and work of this college hold on this planet have increase view transcript transcript senator moss old colleague in the|united|states|senate distinguished senator moss president mckay mr. brown secretary udall governor mr. rawlings lady and gentleman appreciate welcome and be very proud to be back in this historic building and have an opportunity to say a few word on some matter which concern as president and hope concern as citizen the fact be take strength and hope in see this monument hear story retell by ted|moss and recall how this state be build and what start with and what have now of all the story of american pioneer and settler none be more inspiring than the mormon trail the quality of the founder of this community be the quality that seek in america the quality which like to feel this country have courage patience faith self reliance perseverance and above all an unflagging determination to see the right prevail come on this trip to see the|united|state and can assure that there be nothing more encouraging for any of who work in washington than to have a chance to fly across this|united|states and drive through and see what a great country be and come to understand somewhat well how this country have be able for so|many|year to carry so many burden in so many part of the world the primary reason for trip be conservation and include in conservation first human resource and then natural resource and think this state can take perhaps great pride and great satisfaction for what have do not in the field of the conservation and the development of natural resource but what have do to educate child this state have a high percentage per capita of population of boy and girl who finish high school and then go to college of all the waste in the|united|state in the 's none be bad than to have boy and girl who will drop out statistic tell drop out of school before have finish come into the labor market unprepared at the very time when machine be take the place of man and women—9|million of have a large minority of population who have not even finish the sixth grade and here in this rich of all country the country which spread the doctrine of freedom and hope around the globe permit most valuable resource young people talent to be waste by leave school so think have to save think have to insist that child be educate to the limit of talent not just in state or in massachusetts but all over the|united|state thomas|jefferson and john|adams who develop the|northwest|ordinance which put so much emphasis on education thomas|jefferson once say that any nation which expect to be ignorant and free hope for what never be and never will be so hope can conserve this resource the other be the natural resource of country particularly the land west of the 100th parallel where the rain come 15|or|20|inch a year this state know that the control of water be the secret of the development of the west and whether use for power or for irrigation or for whatever purpose no drop of water west of the 100th parallel should flow to the ocean without be use and to do that require the dedicated commitment of the people of of the west work with the people of all the|united|state who have such an important equity in the richness of this part of the country so that must do also as theodore and franklin|roosevelt and gifford|pinchot do in year past must do in the 's and 's will triple the population of this country in the short space of and want those who come after to have the same rich inheritance that find now in the|united|state this be the reason for the trip but be not what want to speak about|tonight want to speak about the responsibility that feel the|united|state have not in this country but abroad and see the close interrelationship between the strength of the|united|state here at home and the strength of the|united|state around the world there be great natural development here in the|united|state which have have in own way a great effect upon the position and influence and prestige of the|united|state almost than any other act have do do know what be be the|tennessee|valley nearly every leader of every new emerge country that come to the|united|states want to go to new|york to washington and the|tennessee|valley because want to see what be able to do with the most poverty ride section of the|united|state in the short space of by the wise management of resource what happen here in this country affect the security of the|united|state and the cause of freedom around the globe if this be a strong vital and vigorous society the cause of freedom will be strong and vital and vigorous know that many of in this state and other states sometimes wonder where be go and why the|united|state should be so involved in so many affair in so many country all around the globe if task on occasion seem hopeless if despair of ever work will on the|other|94|percent of the world population then let remember that the|mormons|of|a|century|ago be a persecute and prosecute minority harry from place to place the victim of violence and occasionally murder while today in the short space of faith and work be know and respect the world around and voice hear in the high council of this country as the mormons succeed so america can succeed if will not give up or turn back realize that the burden be heavy and realize that there be a great temptation to urge that relinquish that have enough to do here in the|united|state and should not be so busy around the globe the fact of the matter be that this generation of americans be the first generation of country ever to be involve in affair around the globe from the ginning of this country from the|days of washington until this country live an isolated existence through most of history be an unaligned country an uncommitted nation a neutralist nation be by statute as well as by desire have believe that could live behind ocean in safety and prosperity in a comfortable distance from the rest of the world the end of isolation consequently mean a wrench with the very lifeblood the very spine of the nation yet as time pass come to see that the end of isolation be not such a terrible error or evil after all come to see that be the inevitable result of growth the economic growth the military growth and the cultural growth of the|united|state no nation so powerful and so dynamic and as rich as own could hope to live in isolation from other nation especially at a time when science and technology be make the world so small take brigham|young and follower to go from winter|quarters nebraska to the valley of take 30|minute for a missile to go from continent to another do not seek to become a world power this position be thrust upon by event but become just the same and be proud that do can well understand the attraction of those earlier|days each of have moment of longing for the past but world war have clearly show try as may that can not turn back on the world outside if do jeopardize economic well being jeopardize political stability jeopardize physical safety to turn away now be to abandon the world to those whose ambition be to destroy a free society to yield these burden up after have carry for more|than|20|years be to surrender the freedom of country inevitably for without the|united|state the chance of freedom surviving let alone prevail around the globe be nonexistent americans have come a long way in accept in a short time the necessity of world involvement but the strain of this involvement remain and find all over the country see in the letter that come to desk every|day find entangle with apparently unanswerable problem in unpronounceable place discover that enemy in one|decade be ally the next find commit to government whose action can not often approve assist society with principle very different from own the burden of maintain an immense military establishment with one|million americans serve outside frontier of finance a far flung program of development assistance of conduct a complex and baffle diplomacy all weigh heavily upon and cause some to counsel retreat the world be full of contradiction and confusion and policy seem to have lose the black and white clarity of simple time when remember the maine and go to war be little wonder then in this confusion look back to the old day with nostalgia be little wonder that there be a desire in the country to go back to the time when nation live alone be little wonder that increasingly want an end to entangling alliance an end to all help to foreign country a cessation of diplomatic relation with country or state whose principle dislike that get the|united|nation out of the|united|state and the|united|stat out of the|united|nation and that retreat to own hemisphere or even within own boundary to take refuge behind a wall of force this be an understandable effort to recover an old feeling of simplicity yet in world affair as in all other aspect of life the|days of the quiet past be go forever science and technology be irreversible can not return to the|day of the sailing schooner or the cover wagon even if wish and if this nation be to survive and succeed in the real world of today must acknowledge the reality of the world and be those reality that mention now must first of all recognize that can not remake the world simply by own command when can not even bring all of own people into full citizenship without act of violence can understand how much hard be to control event beyond border every nation have own tradition own value own aspiration assistance from time to time can help other nation preserve independence and advance growth but can not remake in own image can not enact law nor can operate government or dictate policy second must recognize that every tion determine policy in term of own interest no nation george|washington write be to be trust farther than be bind by interest and no prudent statesman or politician will depart from national interest be more powerful than ideology and the recent development within the communist empire show this very clearly friendship as palmerston say may rise or wane but interest endure the|united|state have rightly determine in the|years|since|1945 under different administration that interest national security the interest of the|united|states|of|america be best serve by preserve and protect a world of diversity in which no power or no combination of power can threaten the security of the|united|state the reason that move so far into the world be fear that at the end of the war and particularly when china become communist that japan and germany would collapse and these country which have so long serve as a barrier to the soviet advance and the russian advance before that would open up a wave of conquest of all of europe and all of asia and then the balance of power turn against would finally be isolate and ultimately destroy that be what have be engage in for to prevent that happen to prevent any monolithic power have sufficient force to destroy the|united|state for that reason support the alliance in latin|america for that reason support nato to protect the security of western|europe for that reason join seato to protect the security of asia — so that neither russia nor china could control europe and asia and if could not control europe and asia then security be assure this be what have be involve in do and however dangerous and hazardous may be and however close may take to the brink on occasion which have and however tired may get of involvement with these government so far away have simple central theme of american foreign policy which all of must recognize because be a policy which must continue to follow and that be to support the independence of nation so that bloc can not gain sufficient power to finally overcome there be no mistake the vital interest of the|united|state in what go on around the world therefore accept what george|washington say here realize that what george|washington say about no intangle alliance have be end by science and technology and danger and third must recognize that foreign policy in the modern world do not lend to easy simple black and white solution if be to have diplomatic relation only with those country whose principle approve of would have relation with very few country in a very short time if be to withdraw assistance from all government who be run differently from own would relinquish half the world immediately to adversary if be to treat foreign policy as merely a medium for deliver self righteous sermon to supposedly inferior people would give up all thought of world influence or world leadership for the purpose of foreign policy be not to provide an outlet for own sentiment of hope or indignation be to shape real event in a real world can not adopt a policy which say that if something do not happen or other do not do exactly what wish will return to fortress|america that be the policy in this change world of retreat not of strength more important to adopt a black or white all or nothing policy subordinate interest to irritation actual consequence would be fatal to security if be to resign from the|united|nation break off with all country of whom disapprove end foreign aid and assistance to those country in an attempt to keep free call for the resumption of atmospheric nuclear testing and turn back on the rest of mankind would not only be abandon america 's influence in the world would be invite a communist expansion which every communist power would so greatly welcome and all of the effort of so many americans for 18|year would be go with the wind policy under those condition in this dangerous world would not have much deterrent effect in a world where nation determine to be free could no longer count on the|united|state such a policy of retreat would be folly if have back to the wall be surely even great folly at a time when more realistic more responsible more affirmative policy have work such spectacular resuit for the most striking thing about world in be the extent to which the tide of history have begin to flow in the direction of freedom to renounce the world of freedom now to abandon those who share commitment and retire into lonely and not so splendid isolation would be to give communism the hope which in this twilight of disappointment for may repair division and rekindle hope for after some gain in the fifty the communist offensive which claim to be rid the tide of historic inevitability have be thwart and turn back in recent|months indeed the whole theory of historical inevitability the belief that all road must lead to communism sooner or later have be shatter by the determination of those who believe that man and nation will pursue a variety of road that each nation will evolve accord to own tradition and own aspiration and that the world of the future will have room for a diversity of economic system political creed religious faith unite by the respect for other and loyalty to a world order those force of diversity which serve mr. washington 's national interest those force of diversity be in the ascendancy today even within the communist empire and policy at this point should be to give the force of diversity as oppose to the force of uniformity which adversary espouse every chance every possible support that be why assistance program so much malign of assist country to maintain freedom believe be important this country have see all of the hardship and the grief that have come to by the loss of country in this hemisphere cuba how many other country must be lose if the|united|state decide to end the program that be help these people who be get poor every|year who have none of the resource of this great country who look to for help but on the other hand in case look to the communists for example that be why think this program be important be a means of assist those who want to be free and in the final analysis serve the|united|state in a very real sense that be why the|united|nation be important not because can solve all these problem in this imperfect world but do give a means in those great moment of crisis and in the|last|21/2|years have have at|least|three when the|soviet|union and the|united|state be almost face to face on a collision course do give a means of provide as have in the congo as now be on the border of the yemen as most recently be in a report of the|united|nation at malaysia do give a means to mobilize the opinion of the world to prevent an atomic disaster which would destroy all wherever may live that be why the test ban treaty be important as a first step perhaps to be disappoint perhaps to find ultimately set back but at least in the|united|state commit and the senate of the|united|state by an overwhelming vote to chance to end the radiation and the possibility of burn may be as say that may fail but anyone who bother to look at the true destructive power of the atom today and what and the|soviet|union could do to each other and the world in an|hour and in a|day and to western|europe — pass over yesterday the little big horn where general|custer be slay a massacre which have live in history or man be talk about|300|million man and woman think be wise to take a first step to lessen the possibility of that happen and that be why diplomacy be important for the force make for diversity be to be find everywhere where people be even within the communist empire and be obligation to encourage those force wherever may be find hard and discourage question remain in viet nam in cuba in laos the congo all around the globe the ordeal of the emerge nation have just begin the control of nuclear weapon be still incomplete the area of potential friction the chance of collision still exist but in every of these area the position of the|united|state believe be happy and safe when history be go for rather than when be go against and have history go for today but history be what man make the future be what man make can not fulfill vision and commitment and interest in a free and diverse future without uncease vigilance devotion and most of all perseverance a willingness to stay with a willingness to do with fatigue a willingness not to accept easy answer but instead to maintain the burden as the people of this state have do for and as the|united|state must do the rest of this|century until finally live in a peaceful world therefore think this country will continue commitment to support the world of freedom for as discharge that commitment be heed the command which brigham|young hear from the lord more than a century ago the command convey to follower go as pioneer to a land of peace thank view transcript

conflict or ambition the cold war be not the only expression of tension in this world and the nuclear race be not the only arm race even little war be dangerous in a nuclear world the long labor of peace be an undertaking for every nation and in this effort none of can remain unaligned to this goal none can be uncommitte the reduction of global tension must not be an excuse for the narrow pursuit of self interest if the|soviet|union and the|united|state with all of global interest and clash commitment of ideology and with nuclear weapon still aim at each other today can find area of common interest and agreement then surely other nation can do the same nation catch in regional conflict in racial issue or in the death throe of old colonialism chronic dispute which divert precious resource from the need of the people or drain the energy of both side serve the interest of no one and the badge of responsibility in the modern world be a willingness to seek peaceful solution be never too early to try and be never too late to talk and be high time that many dispute on the agenda of this assembly be take off the debating schedule and place on the negotiating table the fact remain that the|united|state as a major nuclear power do have a special responsibility in the world be in fact a threefold responsibility a responsibility to own citizen a responsibility to the people of the whole world who be affect by decision and to the next generation of humanity believe the|soviet|union also have these special responsibility and that those responsibility require nation to concentrate less on difference and more on the mean of resolve peacefully for too long both of have increase military budget nuclear stockpile and capacity to destroy all life on this hemisphere human animal vegetable without any corresponding increase in security conflict to be sure be real concept of the world be different no service be perform by fail to make clear disagreement a central difference be the belief of the american people in self determination for all people believe that the people of germany and berlin must be free to reunite capital and country believe that the people of cuba must be free to secure the fruit of the revolution that have be betray from within and exploit from without in short believe that all the world in as well as western in southern|africa as well as northern in old nation as well as new that people must be free to choose own future without discrimination or dictation without coercion or subversion these be the basic difference between the|soviet|union and the|united|state and can not be conceal so long as exist set limit to agreement and forbid the relaxation of vigilance defense around the world will be maintain for the protection of freedom and determination to safeguard that freedom will measure up to any threat or challenge but would say to the leader of the|soviet|union and to people that if either of country be to be fully secure need a much well weapon than the h bomb a weapon better than ballistic missile or nuclear submarine and that well weapon be peaceful cooperation have in recent|years agree on a limited test ban treaty on an emergency communication link between capital on a statement of principle for disarmament on an increase in cultural exchange on cooperation in outer space on the peaceful exploration of the antarctic and on tempering last|year 's crisis over cuba believe therefore that the|soviet|union and the|united|state together with ally can achieve further agreement agreement which spring from mutual interest in avoid mutual destruction there can be no doubt about the agenda of further step must continue to seek agreement on measure which prevent war by accident or miscalculation must continue to seek agreement on safeguard against surprise attack include observation post at key point must continue to seek agreement on further measure to curb the nuclear arm race by control the transfer of nuclear weapon convert fissionable material to peaceful purpose and ban underground testing with adequate inspection and enforcement must continue to seek agreement on a free flow of information and people from east to west and west to east must continue to seek agreement encourage by yesterday 's affirmative response to this proposal by the soviet foreign minister on an arrangement to keep weapon of mass destruction out of outer space let get negotiator back to the negotiating table to work out a practicable arrangement to this end in these and other way let move up the steep and difficult path toward comprehensive disarmament secure mutual confidence through mutual verification and build the institution of peace as dismantle the engine of war must not let failure to agree on all point delay agreement where agreement be possible and must not put forward proposal for propaganda purpose finally in a field where the|united|state and the|soviet|union have a special capacity in the field of space there be room for new cooperation for further joint effort in the regulation and exploration of space include among these possibility a joint expedition to the moon space offer no problem of sovereignty by resolution of this assembly the member of the|united|nation have foresworn any claim to territorial right in outer space or on celestial body and declare that international law and the|united|nations|charter will apply why therefore should man 's first flight to the moon be a matter of national competition why should the|united|state and the|soviet|union in prepare for such expedition become involved in immense duplication of research construction and expenditure surely should explore whether the scientist and astronaut of country indeed of all the world cannot work together in the conquest of space send some|day in this|decade to the moon not the respresentative of a single nation but the representative of all of country all these and other new step toward peaceful cooperation may be possible most of will require on part full consultation with ally for interest be as much involve as own and will not make an agreement at expense most of will require long and careful negotiation and most of will require a new approach to the cold war a desire not to bury one 's adversary but to compete in a host of peaceful arena in idea in production and ultimately in service to all mankind the contest will continue the contest between those who see a monolithic world and those who believe in diversity but should be a contest in leadership and responsibility instead of destruction a contest in achievement instead of intimidation speak for the|united|states|of|america welcome such a contest for believe that truth be strong than error and that freedom be more enduring than coercion and in the contest for a well life all the world can be a winner the effort to improve the condition of man however be not a task for the few be the task of all nation act alone act in group act in the|united|nation for plague and pestilence and plunder and pollution the hazard of nature and the hunger of child be the foe of every nation the earth the sea and the air be the concern of every nation and science technology and education can be the ally of every nation never before have man have such capacity to control own environment to end thirst and hunger to conquer poverty and disease to banish illiteracy and massive human misery have the power to make this the good generation of mankind in the history of the world or to make the last the|united|state since the close of the war have send over|$100|billion worth of assistance to nation seek economic viability and form a|peace|corps to help interested nation meet the demand for train manpower other industrialized nation whose economy be rebuild not so long ago with some help from be now in turn recognize responsibility to the less developed nation the provision of development assistance by individual nation must go on but the|united|nation also must play a large role in help bring to all man the fruit of modern science and industry a united|nation conference on this subject he;d earlier|this|year at geneva open new vista for the develop country next|year a united|nations|conference|on|trade will consider the need of these nation for new market and more|than|four fifth of the entire united|nation system can be find today mobilize the weapon of science and technology for the|united|nations'|decade|of|development but more can be do world center for health communication under the|world|health|organization could warn of epidemic and the adverse effect of certain drug as well as transmit the result of new experiment and new discovery research center could advance common medical knowledge and train new scientist and doctor for new nation global system of satellite could provide communication and weather information for all corner of the earth worldwide program of conservation could protect the forest and wild game preserve now in danger of extinction for all time improve the marine harvest of food from ocean and prevent the contamination of air and water by industrial as well as nuclear pollution finally a worldwide program of farm productivity and food distribution similar to country 's food|for|peace program could now give every child the food need but man do not live by bread alone and the member of this organization be commit by the charter to promote and respect human right those right be not respect when a buddhist priest be drive from pagoda when a synagogue be shut down when a protestant church can not open a mission when a cardinal be force into hiding or when a crowded church service be bomb the|united|states|of|america be oppose to discrimination and persecution on ground of race and religion anywhere in the world include own nation be work to right the wrong of own country through legislation and administrative action through moral and legal commitment this government have launch a determined effort to rid nation of discrimination which have exist far too longin education in housing in transportation in employment in the civil service in recreation and in place of public accommodation and therefore in this or any other forum do not hesitate to condemn racial or religious injustice whether commit or permit by friend or foe know that some of have experience discrimination in this country but ask to believe when tell that this be not the wish of most americans that share regret and resentment and that intend to end such practice for all time to come not only for visitor but for own citizen as well hope that not only nation but all other multiracial society will meet these standard of fairness and justice be oppose to apartheid and all form of human oppression do not advocate the right of black africans in order to drive out white africans concern be the right of all man to equal protection under the law and since human right be indivisible this body can not stand aside when those right be abuse and neglect by any member state new effort be need if this assembly 's declaration of human rights now be to have full meaning and new mean should be find for promote the free expression and trade of idea through travel and communication and through increase exchange of people and book and broadcast for as the world renounce the competition of weapon competition in idea must flourish and that competition must be as full and as fair as possible the united|states delegation will be prepared to suggest to the|united|nation initiative in the pursuit of all the goal for this be an organization for peace and peace can not come without work and without progress the peacekeeping record of the|united|nation have be a proud one though task be always formidable be fortunate to have the skill of distinguished secretary general and the brave effort of those who have be serve the cause of peace in the congo in the|middle|east in korea and kashmir in west|new|guinea and malaysia but what the|united|nation have do in the past be less important than the task for the future can not take peacekeeping machinery for grant that machinery must be soundly finance which can not be if some member be allow to prevent from meet obligation by fail to meet own the|united|nation must be support by all those who exercise franchise here and operation must be back to the end too often a project be undertake in the excitement of a crisis and then begin to lose appeal as the problem drag on and the bill pile up but must have the steadfastness to see every enterprise through be for example most important not to jeopardize the extraordinary united|nation gain in the congo the nation which seek this organization 's help only|3|years|ago have now ask the|united|nation ' presence to remain a little longer believe this assembly should do what be necessary to preserve the gain already make and to protect the new nation in struggle for progress let complete what have start for no man who put hand to the plow and look back as the scripture tell no man who put hand to the plow and look back be fit for also hope that the recent initiative of several member in prepare standby peace force for united|nation call will encourage similar commitment by other this nation remain ready to provide logistic and other material support policing moreover be not enough without provision for pacific settlement should increase the resort to special mission of factfinding and conciliation make great use of the|international|court|of|justice and accelerate the work of the|international|law|commission the|united|nation can not survive as a static organization obligation be increase as well as size charter must be change as well as custom the author of that charter do not intend that be freeze in perpetuity the science of weapon and war have make all far more than in san|francisco world and human race with common destiny in such a world absolute no longer assure of absolute security the convention of peace must pull abreast and then ahead of the invention of war the|united|nation build on success and learn from failure must be develop into a genuine world security system but peace do not rest in charter and covenant alone lie in the heart and mind of all people and if be east out there then no act no pact no treaty no organization can hope to preserve without the support and the wholehearte commitment of all people so let not rest all hope on parchment and on paper let strive to build peace a desire for peace a willingness to work for peace in the heart and mind of all of people believe that can believe the problem of human destiny be not beyond the reach of human being two|years|ago tell this body that the|united|stat have propose and be willing to sign a limited test ban treaty today that treaty have be sign will not put an end to war will not remove basic conflict will not secure freedom for all but can be a lever and archimedes in explain the principle of the lever be say to have declare to friend give a place where can stand and shall move the world fellow inhabitant of this planet let take stand here in this assembly of nation and let see if in own time can move the world to a just and last peace view transcript transcript good evening fellow citizen speak to tonight in a spirit of hope eighteen|years|ago the advent of nuclear weapon change the course of the world as well as the war since that time all mankind have be struggle to escape from the darken prospect of mass destruction on earth in an age when both side have come to possess enough nuclear power to destroy the human race several time over the world of communism and the world of free choice have be catch up in a vicious circle of conflict ideology and interest each increase of tension have produce an increase of arm each increase of arm have produce an increase of tension in these|year the|united|state and the|soviet|union have frequently communicate suspicion and warning to each other but very rarely hope representative have meet at the summit and at the brink have meet in washington and in moscow in geneva and at the|united|nation but too often these meeting have produce only darkness discord or disillusion yesterday a shaft of light cut into the darkness negotiation be conclude in moscow on a treaty to ban all nuclear test in the atmosphere in outer space and under water for the first time an agreement have be reach on bring the force of nuclear destruction under international control a goal first seek in when bernard|baruch present a comprehensive control plan to the|united|nation that plan and many subsequent disarmament plan large and small have all be block by those oppose to international inspection a ban on nuclear test however require on the spot inspection only for underground test this nation now possess a variety of technique to detect the nuclear test of other nation which be conduct in the air or under water for such test produce unmistakable sign which modern instrument can pick up the treaty initial yesterday therefore be a limited treaty which permit continue underground testing and prohibit only those test that can police require no control post no onsite inspection no international body should also understand that have other limit as well any nation which sign the treaty will have an opportunity to withdraw if find that extraordinary event relate to the subject matter of the treaty have jeopardize supreme interest and no nation 's right of self defense will in any way be impair nor do this treaty mean an end to the threat of nuclear war will not reduce nuclear stockpile will not halt the production of nuclear weapon will not restrict use in time of war nevertheless this limited treaty will radically reduce the nuclear testing which would otherwise be conduct on both side will prohibit the|united|state the|united|kingdom the|soviet|union and all other who sign from engage in the atmospheric test which have so alarmed mankind and offer to all the world a welcome sign of hope for this be not a unilateral moratorium but a specific and solemn legal obligation while will not prevent this nation from testing underground or from be ready to conduct atmospheric test if the act of other so require give a concrete opportunity to extend coverage to other nation and later to other form of nuclear test this treaty be in part the product of western patience and vigilance have make clear most recently in berlin and cuba deep resolve to protect security and freedom against any form of aggression have also make clear steadfast determination to limit the arm race in administration soldier and diplomat have work together to this end always support by great|britain prime minister macmillan join with president eisenhower in propose a limited test ban in and again with in and but the achievement of this goal be not a victory for side — be a victory for mankind reflect no concession either to or by the|soviet|union reflect simply common recognition of the danger in further testing this treaty be not the millennium will not resolve all conflict or cause the communists to forego ambition or eliminate the danger of war will not reduce need for arm or ally or program of assistance to other but be an important first step a step towards peace a step towards reason a step away from war here be what this step can mean to and to child and neighbor first this treaty can be a step towards reduced world tension and broad area of agreement the moscow talk have reach no agreement on any other subject nor be this treaty condition on any other matter under secretary harriman make clear that any nonaggression arrangement across the division in europe would require full consultation with ally and full attention to interest also make clear strong preference for a more comprehensive treaty ban all test everywhere and ultimate hope for general and complete disarmament the|soviet|government however be still unwilling to accept the inspection such goal require no one can predict with certainty therefore what further agreement if any can be build on the foundation of this one could include control on preparation for surprise attack or on number and type of armament there could be further limitation on the spread of nuclear weapon the important point be that effort to seek new agreement will go forward but the difficulty of predict the next step be no reason to be reluctant about this step nuclear test ban negotiation have long be a symbol of east west disagreement if this treaty can also be a symbol if can symbolize the end of era and the beginning of another if both side can by this treaty gain confidence and experience in peaceful collaboration then this short and simple treaty may well become an historic mark in man 's age old pursuit of peace western policy have long be design to persuade the|soviet|union to renounce aggression direct or indirect so that people and all people may live and let live in peace the unlimited testing of new weapon of war can not lead towards that end — but this treaty if can be follow by further progress can clearly move in that direction do not say that a world without aggression or threat of war would be an easy world will bring new problem new challenge from the communists new danger of relax vigilance or of mistake intent but those danger pale in comparison to those of the spiral arm race and a collision course towards war since the beginning of history war have be mankind 's constant companion have be the rule not the exception even a nation as young and as peace loving as own have fight through war and time in the|last|two|years|and|a|half have be require to report to as president that this nation and the|soviet|union stand on the verge of direct military confrontation in laos in berlin and in cuba a war today or tomorrow if lead to nuclear war would not be like any war in history a full scale nuclear exchange last less|than|60|minute with the weapon now in existence could wipe out americans europeans and russians as well as untold number elsewhere and the survivor as chairman khrushchev warn the communist chinese the survivor would envy the dead for would inherit a world so devastate by explosion and poison and fire that today can not even conceive of horror so let try to turn the world away from war let make the most of this opportunity and every opportunity to reduce tension to slow down the perilous nuclear arm race and to check the world 's slide toward final annihilation second this treaty can be a step towards free the world from the fear and danger of radioactive fallout own atmospheric test last|year be conduct under condition which restrict such fallout to an absolute minimum but over the|year the number and the yield of weapon test have rapidly increase and so have the radioactive hazard from such testing continued unrestricted testing by the nuclear power join in time by other nation which may be less adept in limit pollution will increasingly contaminate the air that all of must breathe even then the number of child and grandchild with cancer in bone with leukemia in blood or with poison in lung may seem statistically small to some in comparison with natural health hazard but this be not a natural health hazard and be not a statistical issue the loss of even human life or the malformation of even baby who may be bear long after be go — should be of concern to all child and grandchild be not merely statistic toward which can be indifferent nor do this affect the nuclear power alone these test befoul the air of all man and all nation the commit and the uncommitted alike without knowledge and without consent that be why the continuation of atmospheric testing cause so many country to regard all nuclear power as equally evil and can hope that prevention will enable those country to see the world more clearly while enable all the world to breathe more easily third this treaty can be a step toward prevent the spread of nuclear weapon to nation not now possess during in addition to the current nuclear power a small but significant number of nation will have the intellectual physical and financial resource to produce both nuclear weapon and the mean of deliver in time be estimate many other nation will have either this capacity or other way of obtain nuclear warhead even as missile can be commercially purchase today ask to stop and think for a moment what would mean to have nuclear weapon in so many hand in the hand of country large and small stable and unstable responsible and irresponsible scatter throughout the world there would be no rest for anyone then no stability no real security and no chance of effective disarmament there would only be the increase chance of accidental war and an increase necessity for the great power to involve in what otherwise would be local conflict if only|one thermonuclear bomb be to be drop on any american russian or any other city whether be launch by accident or design by a madman or by an enemy by a large nation or by a small from any corner of the world that bomb could release more destructive power on the inhabitant of that helpless city than all the bomb drop in neither the|united|state nor the|soviet|union nor nor france can look forward to that|day with equanimity have a great obligation all nuclear power have a great obligation to use whatever time remain to prevent the spread of nuclear weapon to persuade other country not to test transfer acquire possess or produce such weapon this treaty can be the opening wedge in that campaign provide that none of the party will assist other nation to test in the forbidden environment open the door for further agreement on the control of nuclear weapon and be open for all nation to sign for be in the interest of all nation and already have hear from a number of country who wish to join with promptly fourth and finally this treaty can limit the nuclear arm race in way which on balance will strengthen nation 's security far more than the continuation of unrestricted testing for in today 's world a nation 's security do not always increase as arm increase when adversary be do the same and unlimited competition in the testing and development of new type of destructive nuclear weapon will not make the world safe for either side under this limited treaty on the other hand the testing of other nation could never be sufficient to offset the ability of strategic force to deter or survive a nuclear attack and to penetrate and destroy an aggressor 's homeland have and under this treaty will continue to have the nuclear strength that need be true that the soviets have test nuclear weapon of a yield high than that which think to be necessary but the megaton bomb of which speak 2|years|ago do not and will not change the balance of strategic power the|united|state have choose deliberately to concentrate on more mobile and more efficient weapon with low but entirely sufficient yield and security be therefore not impair by the treaty be discuss be also true as mr. khrushchev would agree that nation can not afford in these matter to rely simply on the good faith of adversary have not therefore overlook the risk of secret violation there be at present a possibility that deep in outer space that hundreds|and|thousands|and|millions|of|mile away from the earth illegal test may go undetected but already have the capability to construct a system of observation that would make such test almost impossible to conceal and can decide at any time whether such a system be need in the light of the limited risk to and the limited reward to other of violation attempt at that range for any test which may be conduct so far out in space which can not be conduct more easily and efficiently and legally underground would necessarily be of such a magnitude that would be extremely difficult to conceal can also employ new device to check on the testing of small weapon in the low atmosphere any violation moreover involve along with the risk of detection the end of the treaty and the worldwide consequence for the violator secret violation be possible and secret preparation for a sudden withdrawal be possible and thus own vigilance and strength must be maintain as remain ready to withdraw and to resume all form of testing if must but would be a mistake to assume that this treaty will be quickly break the gain of illegal testing be obviously slight compare to cost and the hazard of discovery and the nation which have initial and will sign this treaty prefer in judgment to unrestricted testing as a matter of own self interest for these nation too and all nation have a stake in limit the arm race in hold the spread of nuclear weapon and in breathing air that be not radioactive while may be theoretically possible to demonstrate the risk inherent in any treaty and such risk in this treaty be small the far great risk to security be the risk of unrestricted testing the risk of a nuclear arm race the risk of new nuclear power nuclear pollution and nuclear war this limited test ban in most careful judgment be safe by far for the|united|state than an unlimited nuclear arm race for all these reason be hopeful that this nation will promptly approve the limited test ban treaty there will of course be debate in the country and in the senate the constitution wisely require the advice and consent of the senate to all treaty and that consultation have already begin all this be as should be a document which may mark an historic and constructive opportunity for the world deserve an historic and constructive debate be hope that all of will take part in that debate for this treaty be for all of be particularly for child and grandchild and have no lobby here in washington this debate will involve military scientific and political expert but must be not leave to alone the right and the responsibility be yours if be to open new doorway to peace if be to seize this rare opportunity for progress if be to be as bold and farsighte in control of weapon as have be in invention then let now show all the world on this side of the wall and the other that a strong america also stand for peace there be no cause for complacency have learn in time past that the spirit of moment or place can be go in the next have be disappoint more than once and have no illusion now that there be shortcut on the road to peace at many point around the globe the communists be continue effort to exploit weakness and poverty concentration of nuclear and conventional arm must still be deter the familiar contest between choice and coercion the familiar place of danger and conflict be all still there in cuba in southeast|asia in berlin and all around the globe still require all the strength and the vigilance that can muster nothing could more greatly damage cause than if and ally be to believe that peace have already be achieve and that strength and unity be no longer require but now for the first time in many|years the path of peace may be open no one can be certain what the future will bring no one can say whether the time have come for an easing of the struggle but history and own conscience will judge harsher if do not now make every effort to test hope by action and this be the place to begin accord to the ancient chinese proverb a journey of a|thousand|miles must begin with a single step fellow americans let take that first step let if can step back from the shadow of war and seek out the way of peace and if that journey be or even more let history record that in this land at this time take the first step thank and good night view transcript transcript be

who happen to have be bear negro that be admit peacefully on the campus be due in good measure to the conduct of the student of the|university|of|alabama who meet responsibility in a constructive way hope that every american regardless of where live will stop and examine conscience about this and other related incident this nation be found by man of many nation and background be found on the principle that all man be create equal and that the right of every man be diminish when the right of man be threaten today be commit to a worldwide struggle to promote and protect the right of all who wish to be free and when americans be send to viet nam or west|berlin do not ask for white only ought to be possible therefore for american student of any color to attend any public institution select without have to be back up by troop ought to be possible for american consumer of any color to receive equal service in place of public accommodation such as hotel and restaurant and theater and retail store without be force to resort to demonstration in the street and ought to be possible for american citizen of any color to register and to vote in a free election without interference or fear of reprisal ought to be possible in short for every american to enjoy the privilege of be american without regard to race or color in short every american ought to have the right to be treat as would wish to be treat as one would wish child to be treat but this be not the case the negro baby bear in america today regardless of the section of the nation in which be bear have about|one half as

chance of become unemployed about|one seventh as much chance of earn a year a life expectancy which be and the prospect of earn only|half as much this be not a sectional issue difficulty over segregation and discrimination exist in every city in every state of the union produce in many city a rise tide of discontent that threaten the public safety nor be this a partisan issue in a time of domestic crisis man of good will and generosity should be able to unite regardless of party or politic this be not even a legal or legislative issue alone be well to settle these matter in the court than on the street and new law be need at every level but law alone can not make man see right be confront primarily with a moral issue be as old as the scripture and be as clear as the heart of the question be whether all americans be to be afford equal right and equal opportunity whether be go to treat fellow americans as want to be treat if an american because skin be dark can not eat lunch in a restaurant open to the public if can not send child to the good public school available if can not vote for the public official who represent if in short can not enjoy the full and free life which all of want then who among would be content to have the color of skin change and stand in place who among would then be content with the counsel of patience and delay one|hundred|year of delay have pass since president lincoln free the slave yet heir grandson be not fully free be not yet free from the bond of injustice be not yet free from social and economic oppression and this nation for all hope and all boast will not be fully free until all citizen be free preach freedom around the world and mean and cherish freedom here at home but be to say to the world and much more importantly to each other that this be a land of the free except for the negroes that have no second class citizen except negroes that have no class or cast system no ghettoes no master race except with respect to negroes now the time have come for this nation to fulfill promise the event in birmingham and elsewhere have so increase the cry for equality that no city or state or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore the fire of frustration and discord be burn in every city north|and|south where legal remedy be not at hand redress be seek in the street in demonstration parade and protest which create tension and threaten violence and threaten life face therefore a moral crisis as a country and as a people can not be meet by repressive police action can not be leave to increase demonstration in the street can not be quiet by token move or talk be a time to act in the congress in state and local legislative body and above all in all of daily life be not enough to pin the blame on other to say this be a problem of section of the country or another or deplore the fact that face a great change be at hand and task obligation be to make that revolution that change peaceful and constructive for all those who do nothing be invite shame as well as violence those who act boldly be recognize right as well as reality next|week shall ask the congress of the|united|state to act to make a commitment have not fully make in this|century to the proposition that race have no place in american life or law the federal judiciary have uphold that proposition in a series of forthright case the executive branch have adopt that proposition in the conduct of affair include the employment of federal personnel the use of federal facility and the sale of federally finance housing but there be other necessary measure which only the congress can provide and must be provide at this session the old code of equity law under which live command for every wrong a remedy but in too many community in too many part of the country wrong be inflict on negro citizen and there be no remedy at law unless the congress act only remedy be in the street be therefore ask the congress to enact legislation give all americans the right to be serve in facility which be open to the public hotel restaurant theater retail store and similar establishment this seem to to be an elementary right denial be an arbitrary indignity that no american in should have to endure but many do have recently meet with score of business leader urge to take voluntary action to end this discrimination and have be encourage by response and in the|last|2|weeks over city have see progress make in desegregate these kind of facility but many be unwilling to act alone and for this reason nationwide legislation be need if be to move this problem from the street to the court be also ask congress to authorize the|federal|government to participate more fully in lawsuit design to end segregation in public education have succeed in persuade many district to de - segregate voluntarily dozen have admit negroes without violence today a negro be attend a state support institution in every of 50|states but the pace be very slow too many negro child enter segregated grade school at the time of the|supreme|court 's decision 9|years|ago will enter segregated high school this|fall have suffer a loss which can never be restore the lack of an adequate education deny the negro a chance to get a decent job the orderly implementation of the decision therefore can not be leave solely to those who may not have the economic resource to carry the legal action or who may be subject to harassment other feature will be also request include great protection for the right to vote but legislation repeat can not solve this problem alone must be solve in the home of every american in every community across country in this respect want to pay tribute to those citizen north|and|south who have be work in community to make life better for all be act not out of a sense of legal duty but out of a sense of human decency like soldier and sailor in all part of the world be meet freedom 's challenge on the firing line and salute for honor and courage fellow americans this be a problem which face all in every city of the north as well as the south today there be negroes unemployed or time as many compare to white inadequate in education move into the large city unable to find work young people particularly out of work without hope deny equal right deny the opportunity to eat at a restaurant or lunch counter or go to a movie theater deny the right to a decent education deny almost today the right to attend a state university even though qualify seem to that these be matter which concern all not merely president or congressmen or governors but every citizen of the|united|state this be country have become country because all of and all the people who come here have an equal chance to develop talent can not say to of the population that can not have that right that child can not have the chance to develop whatever talent have that the only way that be go to get right be to go into the street and demonstrate think owe and owe a well country than that therefore be ask for help in make easy for to move ahead and to provide the kind of equality of treatment which would want to give a chance for every child to be educate to the limit of talent as have say before not every child have an equal talent or an equal ability or an equal motivation but should have the equal right to develop talent and ability and motivation to make something of have a right to expect that the negro community will be responsible will uphold the law but have a right to expect that the law will be fair that the constitution will be color blind as justice|harlan say at this be what be talk about and this be a matter which concern this country and what stand for and in meet ask the support of all citizen thank very much view transcript transcript president anderson member of the faculty board of trustee distinguished guest old colleague senator bob|byrd who have earn degree through many|year of attend night law school while be earn in the|next|30|minute lady and gentleman be with great pride that participate in this ceremony of the|american|university sponsor by the|methodist|church found by bishop john|fletcher|hurst and first open by president woodrow|wilson in this be a young and grow university but have already fulfil bishop|hurst 's enlighten hope for the study of history and public affair in a city devote to the making of history and to the conduct of the public 's business by sponsor this institution of high learn for all who wish to learn whatever color or creed the methodists of this area and the nation deserve the nation 's thank and commend all those who be today graduate professor woodrow|wilson once say that every man send out from a university should be a man of nation as well as a man of time and be confident that the man and woman who carry the honor of graduate from this institution will continue to give from life from talent a high measure of public service and public support there be few earthly thing more beautiful than a university write john|masefield in tribute to english university and word be equally true today do not refer to spire and tower to campus green and ivie wall admire the splendid beauty of the university say because be a place where those who hate ignorance may strive to know where those who perceive truth may strive to make other see have therefore choose this time and this place to discuss a topic on which ignorance too often abound and the truth be too rarely perceive yet be the most important topic on earth world peace what kind of peace do mean what kind of peace do seek not a pax americana enforce on the world by american weapon of war not the peace of the grave or the security of the slave be talk about genuine peace the kind of peace that make life on earth worth living the kind that enable man and nation to grow and to hope and to build a well life for child not merely peace for americans but peace for all man and woman — not merely peace in time but peace for all time speak of peace because of the new face of war total war make no sense in an age when great power can maintain large and relatively invulnerable nuclear force and refuse to surrender without resort to those force make no sense in an age when a single nuclear weapon contain almost|ten time the explosive force deliver by all of the ally air force in make no sense in an age when the deadly poison produce by a nuclear exchange would be carry by wind and water and soil and seed to the far corner of the globe and to generation yet unborn today the expenditure of billions|of|dollar every year on weapon acquire for the purpose of make sure never need to use be essential to keep the peace but surely the acquisition of such idle stockpile which can only destroy and never create be not the only much less the most efficient mean of assure peace speak of peace therefore as the necessary rational end of rational man realize that the pursuit of peace be not as dramatic as the pursuit of war and frequently the word of the pursuer fall on deaf ear but have no more urgent task some say that be useless to speak of world peace or world law or world disarmament and that will be useless until the leader of the|soviet|union adopt a more enlightened attitude hope do believe can help do but also believe that must reexamine own attitude as individual and as a nation for attitude be as essential as and every graduate of this school every thoughtful citizen who despair of war and wish to bring peace should begin by look inward by examine own attitude toward the possibility of peace toward the|soviet|union toward the course of the cold war and toward freedom and peace here at home first let examine attitude toward peace too many of think be impossible too many think unreal but that be a dangerous defeatist belief lead to the conclusion that war be inevitable that mankind be doom that be grip by force can not control need not accept that view problem be manmade therefore can be solve by man and man can be as big as want no problem of human destiny be beyond human being man 's reason and spirit have often solve the seemingly unsolvable and believe can do again be not refer to the absolute infinite concept of universal peace and good will of which some fantasy and fanatic dream do not deny the value of hope and dream but merely invite discouragement and incredulity by make that only and immediate goal let focus instead on a more practical more attainable peace base not on a sudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution in human institution on a series of concrete action and effective agreement which be in the interest of all concern there be no single simple key to this peace no grand or magic formula to be adopt by or power genuine peace must be the product of many nation the sum of many act must be dynamic not static change to meet the challenge of each new generation for peace be a process a way of solve problem with such a peace there will still be quarrel and conflict interest as there be within family and nation world peace like community peace do not require that each man love neighbor require only that live together in mutual tolerance submit dispute to a just and peaceful settlement and history teach that enmity between nation as between individual do not last forever however fix like and dislikes may seem the tide of time and event will often bring surprising change in the relation between nation and neighbor so let persevere peace need not be impracticable and war nee not be inevitable by define goal more clearly by make seem more manageable and less remote can help all people to see to draw hope from and to move irresistibly toward second let reexamine attitude toward the|soviet|union be discourage to think that leader may actually believe what propagandist write be discourage to read a recent authoritative soviet text on military strategy and find on page after page wholly baseless and incredible claim such as the allegation that american imperialist circle be prepare to unleash different type of war that there be a very real threat of a preventive war be unleash by american imperialist against the|soviet|union and that the political aim of the american imperialist be to enslave economically and politically the european and other capitalist country and to achieve world domination by mean of aggressive war truly as be write long ago the wicked flee when no man pursueth yet be sad to read these soviet statement to realize the extent of the gulf between but be also a warning a warning to the american people not to fall into the same trap as the soviets not to see only a distorted and desperate view of the other side not to see conflict as inevitable accommodation as impossible and communication as nothing more than an exchange of threat no government or social system be so evil that people must be consider as lack in virtue as americans find communism profoundly repugnant as a negation of personal freedom and dignity but can still hail the russian people for many achievement in science and space in economic and industrial growth in culture and in act of courage among the many trait the people of country have in common none be strong than mutual abhorrence of war almost unique among the major world power have never be at war with each other and no nation in the history of battle ever suffer more than the|soviet|union suffer in the course of the|second|world|war at|least|20|million lose life countless million of home and farm be burn or sack a|third of the nation 's territory include nearly|two|third of industrial base be turn into a wasteland a loss equivalent to the devastation of this country east of chicago today should total war ever break out again no matter how — country would become the primary target be an ironic but accurate fact that the strong power be the in the most danger of devastation all have build all have work for would be destroy in the|first|24|hours and even in the cold war which bring burden and danger to so many country include this nation 's close ally country bear the heavy burden for be both devote massive sum of money to weapon that could be better devoted to combat ignorance poverty and disease be both catch up in a vicious and dangerous cycle in which suspicion on side breed suspicion on the other and new weapon beget counter weapon in short both the|united|state and ally and the|soviet|union and ally have a mutually deep interest in a just and genuine peace and in halt the arm race agreement to this end be in the interest of the|soviet|union as well as ours — and even the most hostile nation can be rely upon to accept and keep those treaty obligation and only those treaty obligation which be in own interest so let not be blind to difference but let also direct attention to common interest and to the mean by which those difference can be resolve and if can not end now difference at least can help make the world safe for diversity for in the final analysis most basic common link be that all inhabit this small planet all breathe the same air all cherish child 's future and be all mortal third let reexamine attitude toward the cold war remember that be not engage in a debate seek to pile up debating point be not here distribute blame or point the finger of judgment must deal with the world as be and not as may have be have the history of the|last|18|year be different must therefore persevere in the search for peace in the hope that constructive change within the communist bloc may bring within reach solution which now seem beyond must conduct affair in such a way that become in the communists ' interest to agree on a genuine peace above all while defend own vital interest nuclear power must avert those confrontation which bring an adversary to a choice of either a humiliating retreat or a nuclear war to adopt that kind of course in the nuclear age would be evidence only of the bankruptcy of policy or of a collective death wish for the world to secure these end america 's weapon be nonprovocative carefully control design to deter and capable of selective use military force be commit to peace and discipline in self restraint diplomat be instruct to avoid unnecessary irritant and purely rhetorical hostility for can seek a relaxation of tension without relax guard and for part do not need to use threat to prove that be resolute do not need to jam foreign broadcast out of fear faith will be erode be unwilling to impose system on any unwilling people but be willing and able to engage in peaceful competition with any people on earth meanwhile seek to strengthen the|united|nation to help solve financial problem to make a more effective instrument for peace to develop into a genuine world security system a system capable of resolve dispute on the basis of law of insure the security of the large and the small and of create condition under which arm can finally be abolish at the same time seek to keep peace inside the non - communist world where many nation all of friend be divide over issue which weaken western unity which invite communist intervention or which threaten to erupt into war effort in west|new|guinea in the congo in the|middle|east and in the indian subcontinent have be persistent and patient despite criticism from both side have also try to set an example for other by seek to adjust small but significant difference with own close neighbor in mexico and in canada speak of other nation wish to make point clear be bind to many nation by alliance those alliance exist because concern and substantially overlap commitment to defend western|europe and west|berlin for example stand undiminished because of the identity of vital interest the|united|state will make no deal with the|soviet|union at the expense of other nation and other people not merely because be partner but also because interest and our converge interest converge however not only in defend the frontier of freedom but in pursue the path of peace be hope and the purpose of allied policy to convince the|soviet|union that too should let each nation choose own future so long as that choice do not interfere with the choice of other the communist drive to impose political and economic system on other be the primary cause of world tension today for there can be no doubt that if all nation could refrain from interfere in the self determination of other the peace would be much more assured this will require a new effort to achieve world law a new context for world discussion will require increase understanding between the soviets and and increase understanding will require increase contact and communication step in this direction be the propose arrangement for a direct line between moscow and washington to avoid on each side the dangerous delay misunderstanding and misreading of the other 's action which may occur at a time of crisis have also be talk in geneva about other first step measure of arm control design to limit the intensity of the arm race and to reduce the risk of accidental war primary long range interest in geneva however be general and complete disarmament — design to take place by stage permit parallel political development to build the new institution of peace which would take the place of arm the pursuit of disarmament have be an effort of this government since the 's have be urgently seek by the|past|three ado ministration and however dim the prospect may be today intend to continue this effort to continue in order that all country include own can better grasp what the problem and possibility of disarmament be the major area of these negotiation where the end be in sight yet where a fresh start be badly need be in a treaty to outlaw nuclear test the conclusion of such a treaty so near and yet so far would check the spiral arm race in of most dangerous area would place the nuclear power in a position to deal more effectively with of the great hazard which man face in the further spread of nuclear arm would increase security would decrease the prospect of war surely this goal be sufficiently important to require steady pursuit yield neither to the temptation to give up the whole effort nor the temptation to give up insistence on vital and responsible safeguard be take this opportunity therefore to announce important decision in this regard first chairman khrushchev prime minister macmillan and have agree that highlevel discussion will shortly begin in moscow look toward early agreement on a comprehensive test ban treaty hope must be temper with the caution of history but with hope go the hope of all mankind second to make clear good faith and solemn conviction on the matter now declare that the|united|states do not propose to conduct nuclear test in the atmosphere so long as other state do not do so will not be the first to resume such a declaration be no substitute for a formal binding treaty but hope will help achieve nor would such a treaty be a substitute for disarmament but hope will help achieve finally fellow americans let examine attitude toward peace and freedom here at home the quality and spirit of own society must justify and support effort abroad must show in the dedication of own life as many of who be graduate today will have a unique opportunity to do by serve without pay in the peace|corps abroad or in the propose national|service|corp here at home but wherever be must all in daily life live up to the age old faith that peace and freedom walk together in too many of city today the peace be not secure because freedom be incomplete be the responsibility of the executive branch at all level of government local state and national — to provide and protect that freedom for all of citizen by all mean within authority be the responsibility of the legislative branch at all level wherever that authority be not now adequate to make adequate and be the responsibility of all citizen in all section of this country to respect the right of all other and to respect the law of the land all this be not unrelated to world peace when a man 's way please the lord the scripture tell maketh even enemy to be at peace with and be not peace in the last analysis basically a matter of human right the right to live out life without fear of devastation the right to breathe air as nature provide the right of future generation to a healthy existence while proceed to safeguard national interest let also safeguard human interest and the elimination of war and arm be clearly in the interest of both no treaty however much may be to the advantage of all however tightly may be word can provide absolute security against the risk of deception and evasion but can — if be sufficiently effective in enforcement and if be sufficiently in the interest of signer offer far more security and far few risk than an unabated uncontrolled unpredictable arm race the|united|state as the world know will never start a war do not want a war do not now expect a war this generation of americans have already have enough more than enough — of war and hate and oppression shall be prepare if other wish shall be alert to try to stop but shall also do part to build a world of peace where the weak be safe and the strong be just be not helpless before that task or hopeless of success confident and unafraid labor on not toward a strategy of annihilation but toward a strategy of peace view transcript transcript general secretary zuckert general lemay member of the congress mr. fraser fellow graduate want to express appreciation for become

force to those of who be graduate from nation 's service academy today for today receive not only degree but also commission and tomorrow join with all those in the military service in the foreign service the civil service and elsewhere and one|million of serve outside frontier who have choose to serve the|great|republic at a turning point in history will have an opportunity to help make that history an opportunity for a service career more varied and demand than any that have be open to any officer corps in the history of any country there be some who may be skeptical of that assertion claim that the future of the|air|force be mortgage to an obsolete weapon system the man aircraft or that air|force officer of the future will be nothing more than silent silo sitter but nothing could be further from the truth be this very onrush of technology which demand an expand role for the nation 's air|force and officer and which guarantee that an career in the|next|40|year will be even more changing and more challenging than the career of the|last|40|year for some of will travel where no man have ever travel before some of will fly the fast plane that have ever be build reach the high altitude that man have ever go to and lift the heavy payload of any aviator in history some of will hold in hand the most awesome destructive power which any nation or any man have conceive some of will work with the leader of new nation which be not even nation a|few|years|ago some of will support guerrilla and counter - guerrilla operation that combine the new technique of warfare with the old technique of the jungle and some of will help develop new plane that spread wing in flight detect other plane at an unheard of distance deliver new weapon with unprecedented accuracy and survey the ground from incredible height as a testament to strong faith in the future of air power and the man airplane be announce today that the|united|states will commit to an important new program in civilian aviation civilian aviation long both the beneficiary and the benefactor of military aviation be of necessity equally dynamic neither the economic nor the politic of international air competition permit to stand still in this area today the challenging new frontier in commercial aviation and in military aviation be a frontier already cross by the military supersonic flight lead member of the administration under the chairmanship of the vice president have be consider carefully the role to be play by in determine the economic and technical feasibility of an american commercial supersonic aircraft and in the development of such an aircraft if be feasible have review recommendation be judgment that this government should immediately commence a new program in partnership with private industry to develop at the early practical date the prototype of a commercially successful supersonic transport superior to that be build in any other country of the world an open preliminary design competition will be initiate immediately among american airframe and powerplant manufacturer with a more detailed design phase to follow if these initial phase do not produce an aircraft capable of transport people and good safely swiftly and at price the traveler can afford and the airline find profitable shall not go further but if can build the good operational plane of this type and believe can then the congress and the country should be prepared to invest the fund and effort necessary to maintain this nation 's lead in long range aircraft a lead have hold since the end of the|second|world|war a lead should make every responsible effort to maintain spur by competition from across the atlantic and by the productivity of own company the|federal|government must pledge fund to supplement the risk capital to be contribute by private company must then rely heavily on the flexibility and ingenuity of private enterprise to make the detailed decision and to introduce successfully this new jet age transport into worldwide service and be talk about a plane in the end of the 's that will move ahead at a speed faster than to all corner of the globe this commitment believe be essential to a strong and forward look nation and indicate the future of the manned aircraft as move into a missile age as well the fact that the great value of all of the weapon of massive retaliation lie in ability to deter war do not diminish importance nor will national security in the|years|ahead be achieve simply by pile up big bomb or bury missile under big load of concrete for in an imperfect world where human folly have be the rule and not the exception the sure way to bring on the war that can never happen be to sit back and assure will not happen the existence of mutual nuclear deterrent can not be shrug off as stalemate for national security in a period of rapid change will depend on constant reappraisal of present doctrine on alertness to new development on imagination and resourcefulness and new idea stalemate be a static term and not of would be here today if believe be enter an outmoded service require only custodial duty in a period of nuclear stalemate be impress by the extraordinary scholastic record unmatched by any new college or university in this country which have be make by the student and graduate of this academy rhodes scholarship last|year two|this|year and other selected scholarship and also record in the graduate record examination make the people of this country proud of this academy and the|air|force which make possible this country be proud of the fact that out of of all military faculty have a doctor 's degree and all the rest have master 's degree this be what need for leadership in military service for the officer of today and tomorrow require the broad kind of scholarship to understand a most complex and change world require understanding and learn unmatched in the|day before world|war|ii any graduate of this academy who serve in armed|force will need to know economic and history and international affair and language will need an appreciation of other society and an understanding of own nation 's purpose and policy general norstad 's leadership in nato general smart 's outstanding tour of duty as the senior military representative in japan be example of officer who use broad talent for the benefit of country many of will have similar opportunity to represent this country in negotiation with adversary as well as friend work with international organization work in every way in the free country around the globe to help maintain freedom major responsibility in the final analysis will relate to military command some of may be member of the|joint|chiefs|of|staff and participate as adviser to the president who hold office last|october 's crisis in the caribbean amply demonstrate that military policy and power can not and must not be separate from political and diplomatic decision whatever the military motive and implication of the reckless attempt to put missile on the island of cuba the political and psychological implication be equally important need in october and have and shall need in the future and shall have military commander who be conscious of the enormous stake in the nuclear age of every decision that take who be aware of the fact that there be no purely political .decision or purely military decision that problem be a mixture of both man who know the difference between vital interest and peripheral interest who can maneuver military force with judgment and precision as well as courage and determination and who can foresee the effect of military action on political policy need man in short who can cope with the challenge of a new political struggle an armed doctrine which use every weapon in the struggle around the globe live in a world in short where the principal problem that face be not susceptible to military solution alone the role of military power in essence be therefore to free and ally to pursue the goal of freedom without the danger of enemy attack but do not have a separate military policy and a separate diplomatic policy and a separate disarmament policy and a separate foreign aid policy all unrelated to each other be all bind up together in the policy of the|united|state goal be a coherent overall national security policy that truly serve the good interest of this country and those who depend upon be worth note that all of the decision which now face today will come in increase number in the|months|and|years|ahead want to congratulate all of who have choose the|united|states|air|force as a career as far as any of can now see in washington in the|days|ahead will occupy position of the high responsibility and merely because move into a change period of weapon technology as well as political challenge because in fact move into that period there be great need for than ever before here

or legacy from the past increase responsibility go with increase ability for of those to whom much be give much be require commodore vanderbilt recognize this responsibility and recognition make possible the establishment of a great institution of learn for which will be long remember after steamboat and railroad have be forget speak in particular therefore of the responsibility of the educate citizen include the student the faculty and the alumnus of this great institution the creation and maintenance of vanderbilt|university like that of all great university have require considerable effort and expenditure and can not believe that all of this be undertake merely to give this school 's graduate an economic advantage in the life struggle every man send out from a university say professor woodrow|wilson every man send out from a university should be a man of nation as well as a man of time have responsibility in short to use talent for the benefit of the society which help develop those talent must decide as goethe put whether will be an anvil or a hammer whether will give to the world in which be rear and educate the broad possible benefit of that education of the many special obligation incumbent upon an educate citizen would cite as outstanding obligation to the pursuit of learning obligation to serve the public obligation to uphold the law if the pursuit of learning be not defend by the educate citizen will not be defend at all for there will always be those who scoff at intellectual who cry out against research who seek to limit educational system modern cynic and skeptic see no more reason for land a man on the moon which shall do than the cynic and skeptic of half|a|millennium|ago see for the discovery of this country see no harm in pay those to whom entrust the mind of child a small wage than be pay to those to whom entrust the care of plumbing but the educate citizen know how much more there be to know know that knowledge be power more so today than ever before know that only an educated and informed people will be a free people that the ignorance of voter in a democracy impair the security of all and that if can as jefferson put enlighten the people generally tyranny and the oppression of mind and body will vanish like evil spirit at the dawn of day and therefore the educate citizen have a special obligation to encourage the pursuit of learning to promote exploration of the unknown to preserve the freedom of inquiry to support the advancement of research and to assist at every level of government the improvement of education for all americans from grade school to graduate school secondly the educate citizen have an obligation to serve the public may be a precinct worker or president may give talent at the courthouse the state house may be a civil servant or a senator a candidate or a campaign worker a winner or a loser but must be a participant and not a spectator at the olympic game aristotle write be not the fine and strong man who be crown but who enter the list for out of these the prize man be elect so too in life of the honorable and the good be who act who rightly win the prize urge all of today especially those who be student to act to enter the list of public service and rightly win or lose the prize for can have only|one form of aristocracy in this country as jefferson write long ago in reject john|adam ' suggestion of an artificial aristocracy of wealth and birth be write the natural aristocracy of character and talent and the good form of government add be that which select these man for position of responsibility would hope that all educate citizen would fulfill this obligation in politic in government here in nashville here in this state in the|peace|corp in the|foreign|service in the|government|service in the|tennessee|valley in the world will find the pressure great than the pay may endure more public attack than support but will have the unequaled satisfaction of know that character and talent be contribute to the direction and success of this free society third and finally the educate citizen have an obligation to uphold the law this be the obligation of every citizen in a free and peaceful society but the educate citizen have a special responsibility by the virtue of great understanding for whether have ever study history or current event ethic or civic the rule of a profession or the tool of a trade know that only a respect for the law make possible for free man to dwell together in peace and progress know that law be the adhesive force in the cement of society create order out of chaos and coherence in place of anarchy know that for man to defy a law or court order do not like be to invite other to defy those which do not like lead to a breakdown of all justice and all order know too that every fellowman be entitle to be regard with decency and treat with dignity any educate citizen who seek to subvert the law to suppress freedom or to subject other human being to act that be less than human degrade heritage ignore learning and betray obligation certain other society may respect the rule of force respect the rule of law the nation indeed the whole world have watch recent event in the|united|state with alarm and dismay no one can deny the complexity of the problem involve in assure to all of citizen full fight as americans but no one can gainsay the fact that the determination to secure these right be in the high tradition of american freedom in these moment of tragic disorder a special burden rest on the educate man and woman of country to reject the temptation of prejudice and violence and to reaffirm the value of freedom and law on which free society depend when bishop|mctyeire propose to commodore vanderbilt say commodore country have be tear to piece by a civil war want to repair this damage and commodore vanderbilt reportedly reply want to unite this country and all section of so that all people will be response recognition of obligation and opportunity give vanderbilt|university not only an endowment but also a mission now in a time of tension be more important than ever to unite this country and strengthen these tie so that all of people will be year from now have no doubt that vanderbilt|university will still be fulfil this mission will still uphold learning encourage public service and teach respect for the law will neither turn back on prove wisdom or turn face from newborn challenge will still pass on to the youth of land the full meaning of right and responsibility and will still be teach the truth the truth that make free and will keep free thank view transcript transcript mr. vice president mr. speaker member of the 88th congress congratulate all not merely on electoral victory but on select role in history for and be privileged to serve the great republic in what could be the|most|decisive|decade in long history the choice make for good or ill may well shape the state of the union for generation yet to come little more|than|100|weeks|ago assume the office of president of the|united|state in seek the help of the congress and countryman pledge no easy answer pledge and ask only toil and dedication these the congress and the people have give in good measure and today have witness in recent|months a heightened respect for national purpose and power have see the courageous calm of a united people in a|perilous|hour and have observe a steady improvement in the opportunity and well being of citizen can report to that the state of this old but youthful union in the|175th|year of life be good in the world beyond border steady progress have be make in build a world of order the people of west|berlin remain both free and secure a settlement though still precarious have be reach in laos the spearpoint of aggression have be blunt in viet nam the end of agony may be in sight in the congo the doctrine of troika be dead and while danger continue a deadly threat have be remove in cuba at home the recession be behind well over a more man and woman be work today than be work the average factory workweek be once again more|than|40|hour industry be turn out more good than ever before and more|than|half of the manufacturing capacity that lie silent and waste be hum with activity in short both at home and abroad there may now be a temptation to relax for the road have be long the burden heavy and the pace consistently urgent but can not be satisfied to rest here this be the side of the hill not the top the mere absence of war be not peace the mere absence of recession be not growth have make a beginning but have only begin now the time have come to make the most of gain to translate the renewal of national strength into the achievement of national purpose america have enjoy of uninterrupted economic recovery but recovery be not enough if be to prevail in the long run must expand the long run strength of economy must move along the path to a high rate of growth and full employment for this would mean tens|of|billions|of|dollar more each|year in production profit wage and public revenue would mean an end to the persistent slack which have keep unemployment at or above|5|percent for out of the|past|62|month and an end to the grow pressure for such restrictive measure as which alone could increase hourly labor cost by as|much|as|14|percent start a new wage price spiral of inflation and undercut effort to compete with other nation to achieve these great gain step above all be essential the enactment this|year of a substantial reduction and revision in federal income taxis for be increasingly clear to those in government business and labor who be responsible for economy 's success that obsolete tax system exert too heavy a drag on private purchasing power profit and employment design to check inflation in earlier|years now check growth instead discourage extra effort and risk distort the use of resource invite recurrent recession depress federal revenue and cause chronic budget deficit now when the inflationary pressure of the war and the post - war year no longer threaten and the dollar command new respect now when no military crisis strain resource now be the time to act can not afford to be timid or slow for this be the most urgent task confront the congress in in an early message shall propose a permanent reduction in tax rate which will lower liability by of this result from reduce individual tax rate which now range between|20|and|91|percent to a more sensible range of with a split in the present first bracket and half dollar result from reduce corporate tax rate from which give the government today a majority interest in profit to the permanent pre - korean level of this be in addition to the|more|than|$2|billion cut in corporate tax liability result from last|year 's investment credit and depreciation reform to achieve this reduction within the limit of a manageable budgetary deficit urge first that these cut be phase over|3|calendar|year begin in with a cut of some|$6|billion at annual rate that these reduction be couple with select structural change begin in which will broaden the tax base end unfair or unnecessary preference remove or lighten certain hardship and in the net offset some|$3.5|billion of the revenue loss and third that budgetary receipt at the outset be increase by a year without any change in tax liability by gradually shift the tax payment of large corporation to a more current time schedule this combine program by increase the amount of national income will in time result in still high federal revenue be a fiscally responsible program the sure and the sound way of achieve in time a balanced budget in a balanced full employment economy this net reduction in tax liability of will increase the purchasing power of american family and business enterprise in every tax bracket with great increase go to low income consumer will in addition encourage the initiative and risk taking on which free system depend induce more investment production and capacity use help provide the new job need every year and reinforce the american principle of additional reward for additional effort do not say that a measure for tax reduction and reform be the only way to achieve these goal doubt a massive increase in federal spending could also create job and growth but in today 's setting private consumer employer and investor should be give a full opportunity first doubt a temporary tax cut could provide a spur to economy but a long run problem compel a long run solution doubt a reduction in either individual or corporation taxis alone would be of great help but corporation need customer and job seeker need job doubt tax reduction without reform would sound simple and more attractive to many but growth be also hamper by a host of tax inequity and special preference which have distort the flow of investment finally there be no doubt some who would prefer to put off a tax cut in the hope that ultimately an end to the cold war would make possible an equivalent cut in expenditure but that end be not in view and to wait for would be costly and self defeat in submit a tax program which will of course temporarily increase the deficit but can ultimately end and in recognition of the need to control expenditure will shortly submit a fiscal|1964 administrative budget which while allow for need rise in defense space and fix interest charge hold total expenditure for all other purpose below this year 's level this require the reduction or postponement of many desirable program the absorption of a large part of last|year 's federal pay raise through personnel and other economy the termination of certain installation and project and the substitution in several program of private for public credit but be convince that the enactment this|year of tax reduction and tax reform overshadow all other domestic problem in this congress for can not for long lead the cause of peace and freedom if ever cease to set the pace here at home tax reduction alone however be not enough to strengthen society to provide opportunity for the four|million americans who be bear every|year to improve the life of americans who live on the outskirt of poverty the quality of american life must keep pace with the quantity of american good this country can not afford to be materially rich and spiritually poor therefore by hold down the budgetary cost of exist program to keep within the limitation have set be both possible and imperative to adopt other new measure that can not afford to postpone these measure be base on a series of fundamental premise group under related heading first need to strengthen nation by invest in youth future of any country which be dependent upon the will and wisdom of citizen be damage and irreparably damage whenever any of child be not educate to the full extent of talent from grade school through graduate school today an|estimated|4 out of every student in the 5th grade will not even finish high school and that be a waste can not afford addition there be no reason why one|million young americans out of school and out of work should all remain unwanted and often untrained on city street when energy can be put to good use --finally the overseas success of volunteer most of young man and woman carry skill and idea to needy people suggest the merit of a similar corps serve own community need in mental hospital on indian reservation in center for the age or for young delinquent in school for the illiterate or the handicapped as the idealism of youth have serve world peace so can serve the domestic tranquility need to strengthen nation by safeguard health work man and woman instead of be force to beg for help from public charity once be old and ill should start contribute now to own retirement health program through the|social|security|system all miracle of medical research will count for little if can not reverse the grow nationwide shortage of doctor dentist and nurse and the widespread shortage of nursing home and modern urban hospital facility merely to keep the present ratio of doctor and dentist from decline any further must over the|next|10|years increase the capacity of medical school by and dental school by --finally and of deep concern believe that the abandonment of the mentally ill and the mentally retarded to the grim mercy of custodial institution too often inflict on and on family a needless cruelty which this nation should not endure the incidence of mental retardation in this country be time as high as that of sweden for example and that figure can and must be reduce third need to strengthen nation by protect the basic right of citizen right to competent counsel must be assure to every man accuse of crime in federal court regardless of mean the most precious and powerful right in the world the right to vote in a free american election must not be deny to any citizen on ground of race or color wish that all qualified americans permit to vote be willing to vote but surely in this|centennial|year of emancipation all those who be willing to vote should always be permit fourth need to strengthen nation by make the good and the most economical use of resource and facility economic health depend on healthy transportation artery and believe the way to a more modern economical choice of national transportation service be through increase competition and decrease regulation local mass transit fare even bad be as essential a community service as hospital and highway nearly|three fourth of citizen live in urban area which occupy only|2|percent of land and if local transit be to survive and relieve the congestion of these city need federal stimulation and assistance this government be in the storage and stockpile business to the melancholy tune of more|than|$|16|billion must continue to support farm income but should not pile more farm surplus on top of the already own must maintain a stockpile of strategic material but the have acquire for reason both good and bad be much more than need and should be empower to dispose of the excess in way which will not cause market disruption --finally already overcrowd national park and recreation area will have twice as many visitor 10|years|from|now as do today if do not plan today for the future growth of these and other great natural asset not only park and forest but wildlife and wilderness preserve and water project of all kind child and child will be poor in every sense of the word these be not domestic concern alone for upon achievement of great vitality and strength here at home hang fate and future in the world ability to sustain and supply the security of free man and nation ability to command respect for leadership ability to expand trade without threat to balance of payment and ability to adjust to the change demand of cold war competition and challenge shall be judge more by what do at home than by what preach abroad nothing could do to help the develop country would help half as much as a booming u.s. economy and nothing opponent could do to encourage own ambition would encourage half as much as a chronic lag u.s. economy these domestic task do not divert energy from security provide the very foundation for freedom 's survival and success turn to the world outside be only|a|few|years|ago in southeast|asia africa latin|america even outer space that communism seek to convey the image of a unified confident and expand empire close in on a sluggish america and a free world in disarray but few people would hold to that picture today in these|past|months have reaffirm the scientific and military superiority of freedom have double effort in space to assure of be first in the future have undertake the most far reach defense improvement in the peacetime history of this country and have maintain the frontier of freedom from viet nam to west|berlin but complacency or self congratulation can imperil security as much as the weapon of tyranny a moment of pause be not a promise of peace dangerous problem remain from cuba to the|south|china|sea the world 's prognosis prescribe in short not a year 's vacation for but a|year of obligation and opportunity special avenue of opportunity stand out the develop nation the new sino soviet difficulty and the search for worldwide peace first how fare the grand alliance free europe be enter into a new phase of long and brilliant history the era of colonial expansion have pass the era of national rivalry be fade and a new era of interdependence and unity be take shape defy the old prophecy of marx consent to what no conqueror could ever compel the free nation of europe be move toward a unity of purpose and power and policy in every sphere of activity for this movement have have consistent support both political and economic far from resent the new europe regard as a welcome partner not a rival for the road to world peace and freedom be still long and there be burden which only full partner can share in support the common defense in expand world trade in align balance of payment in aid the emergent nation in concert political and economic policy and in welcome to common effort other industrialized nation notably japan whose remarkable economic and political development of the 's permit now to play on the world scene a major constructive role no doubt difference of opinion will continue to get more attention than agreement on action as europe move from independence to more formal interdependence but these be honest difference among honorable associate more real and frequent in fact among western|european ally than between and the|united|state for the unity of freedom have never rely on uniformity of opinion but the basic agreement of this alliance on fundamental issue continue the first task of the alliance remain the common defense last|month prime minister macmillan and lay plan for a new stage in long cooperative effort which aim to assist in the wide task of frame a common nuclear defense for the whole alliance the nassau agreement recognize that the security of the west be indivisible and so must be defense but also recognize that this be an alliance of proud and sovereign nation and work best when do not forget recognize further that the nuclear defense of the west be not a matter for the present nuclear power alone that france will be such a power in the future and that way must be find without increase the hazard of nuclear diffusion to increase the role of other partner in planning manning and direct a truly multilateral nuclear force within an increasingly intimate nato alliance finally the nassau agreement recognize that nuclear defense be not enough that the agree nato level of conventional strength must be meet and that the alliance can not afford to be in a position of have to answer every threat with nuclear weapon or nothing remain too near the nassau decision and too far from full realization to know place in history but believe that for the first time the door be open for the nuclear defense of the alliance to become a source of confidence instead of a cause of contention the next most pressing concern of the alliance be common economic goal of trade and growth this nation continue to be concerned about balance of payment deficit which despite decline remain a stubborn and troublesome problem believe moreover that close economic tie among all free nation be essential to prosperity and peace and neither nor the member of the|european|common|market be so affluent that can long afford to shelter high cost farm or factory from the wind of foreign competition or to restrict the channel of trade with other nation of the free world if the common market should move toward protectionism and restrictionism would undermine own basic principle this government mean to use the authority confer on last year by the congress to encourage trade expansion on both side of the atlantic and around the world what of the develop and nonaligned nation be shock by the soviets ' sudden and secret attempt to transform cuba into a nuclear strike base and by communist china 's arrogant invasion of india have be reassure by prompt assistance to india by support through the|united|nation of the congo 's unification by patient search for disarmament and by the improvement in treatment of citizen and visitor whose skin do not happen to be white and as the old colonialism recede and the neocolonialism of the communist power stand out more starkly than ever realize more clearly that the issue in the world struggle be not communism versus capitalism but coercion versus free choice be begin to realize that the longing for independence be the same the world over whether be the independence of west|berlin or viet nam be begin to realize that such independence run athwart all communist ambition but be in keep with own and that approach to diverse need be resilient and resourceful while the communists be still rely on ancient doctrine and dogma nevertheless be hard for any nation to focus on an external or subversive threat to independence when energy be drain in daily combat with the force of poverty and despair make little sense for to assail in speech and resolution the horror of communism to spend a year to prevent military advance and then to begrudge spending largely on american product less than tenth of that amount to help other nation strengthen independence and cure the social chaos in which communism always have thrive be proud and think most americans be proud of a mutual defense and assistance program evolve with bipartisan support in administration which have with all recognize problem contribute to the fact that not a single of the nearly u.n. member to gain independence since the|second|world|war have succumb to communist control be proud of a program that have help to arm and feed and clothe million of people who live on the front line of freedom be especially proud that this country have put forward for the 's a vast cooperative effort to achieve economic growth and social progress throughout the|america the|alliance|for|progress do not underestimate the difficulty that face in this mutual effort among close neighbor but the free state of this hemisphere work in close collaboration have begin to make this alliance a live reality today be feed out of every school age child in latin|america an extra food ration from farm surplus have distribute school book and be build classroom have help resettle tens|of|thousand of farm family on land can call own be stimulate good neighbor to more self help and self reform fiscal social institutional and land reform be bring new housing and hope new health and dignity to million who be forget the man and woman of this hemisphere know that the alliance can not succeed if be only another name for united|stat handout that can succeed only as the latin|american nation devote good effort to fulfil goal this story be the same in africa in the|middle|east and in asia wherever nation be willing to help stand ready to help build new bulwark of freedom be not purchase vote for the cold war have go to the aid of imperil nation neutral and ally alike what do ask and all that ask be that help be use to good advantage and that own effort not be divert by needless quarrel with other independent nation despite all past achievement the continue progress of the mutual assistance program require a persistent discontent with present performance have be reorganize this program to make a more effective efficient instrument and that process will continue this|year but free world development will still be an uphill struggle government aid can only supplement the role of private investment trade expansion commodity stabilization and above all internal self improvement the process of growth be gradual bear fruit in a|decade not a|day success will be neither quick nor dramatic but if these program be ever to be end failure in a dozen country would be sudden and certain neither money nor technical assistance however can be only weapon against poverty in the end the crucial effort be of purpose require the fuel of finance but also a torch of idealism and nothing carry the spirit of this american idealism more effectively to the far corner of the earth than the|american|peace|corps a|year|ago less than volunteer be on the job a|year|from|now will number more than and woman age 18|to|79 willing to give of life to help people in other land there be in fact americans serve country and the cause of freedom in overseas post a record no other people can match surely those of who stay at home should be glad to help indirectly by support aid program open door to foreign visitor and diplomat and student and by proving day by day by deed as well as word that be a just and generous people third what comfort can take from the increase strain and tension within the communist bloc here hope must be temper with caution for the soviet chinese disagreement be over mean not end a dispute over how good to bury the free world be no ground for western rejoicing nevertheless while a strain be not a fracture be clear that the force of diversity be at work inside the communist camp despite all the iron discipline of regimentation and all the iron dogmatism 's of ideology marx be prove wrong once again for be the closed communist society not the free and open society which carry within the seed of internal disintegration the disarray of the communist empire have be heighten by other formidable force be the historical force of nationalism and the yearning of all man to be free the other be the gross inefficiency of economy for a closed society be not open to idea of progress and a police state find that can not command the grain to grow new nation ask to choose between compete system need only compare condition in east and west|germany eastern and western|europe north|and|south|viet nam need only compare the disillusionment of communist cuba with the promise of the|alliance|for|progress and all the world know that no successful system build a wall to keep people in and freedom out and the wall of shame divide berlin be a symbol of communist failure finally what can do to move from the present pause toward endure peace again would counsel caution foresee no spectacular reversal in communist method or goal but if all these trend and development can persuade the|soviet|union to walk the path of peace then let know that all free nation will journey with but until that choice be make and until the world can develop a reliable system of international security the free people have no choice but to keep arm nearby this country therefore continue to require the good defense in the world a defense which be suit to the sixty this mean unfortunately a rise defense budget for there be no substitute for adequate defense and no bargain basement way of achieve mean the expenditure of more|than|$15|billion this|year on nuclear weapon system alone a sum which be about equal to the combine defense budget of european|ally but also mean improve air and missile defense improve civil defense a strengthen anti - guerrilla capacity and of prime importance more powerful and flexible nonnuclear force for threat of massive retaliation may not deter piecemeal aggression and a line of destroyer in a quarantine or a division of well equip man on a border may be more useful to real security than the multiplication of awesome weapon beyond all rational need but commitment to national safety be not a commitment to expand military establishment indefinitely do not dismiss disarmament as merely an idle dream for believe that in the end be the only way to assure the security of all without impair the interest of any nor do mistake honorable negotiation for appeasement while shall never weary in the defense of freedom neither shall ever abandon the pursuit of peace in this quest the united|nation require full and continued support value in serve the cause of peace have be show anew in role in the west new guinea settlement in use as a forum for the cuban crisis and in task of unification in the congo today the|united|nation be primarily the protector of the small and the weak and a safety valve for the strong tomorrow can form the framework for a world of law a world in which no nation dictate the destiny of another and in which the vast resource now devoted to destructive mean will serve constructive end in short let adversary choose if choose peaceful competition shall have if come to realize that ambition can not succeed if see war of liberation and subversion will ultimately fail if recognize that there be more security in accept inspection than in permit new nation to master the black art of nuclear war and if be willing to turn energy as be to the great unfinished task of own people then surely the area of agreement can be very wide indeed a clear understanding about berlin stability in southeast|asia an end to nuclear testing new check on surprise or accidental attack and ultimately general and complete disarmament for seek not the worldwide victory of nation or system but a worldwide victory of man the modern globe be too small weapon be too destructive and disorder be too contagious to permit any other kind of victory to achieve this end the|united|states will continue to spend a great portion of national production than any other people in the free world for no other free nation have demand so much of through hot war and cold through recession and prosperity through the age of the atom and outer space the american people have never falter and faith have never flag if at time action seem to make life difficult for other be only because history have make life difficult for all but difficult day need not be dark think these be proud and memorable day in the cause of peace and freedom be proud for example of major rudolf|anderson who give life over the island of cuba salute specialist james|allen|johnson who die on the border of south|korea pay honor to sergeant gerald|pendell who be kill in viet nam be among the many who in this|century far from home have die for country task now and the task of all americans be to live up to commitment friend close on a note of hope be not lull by the momentary calm of the sea or the somewhat clear sky above know the turbulence that lie below and the storm that be beyond the horizon this|year but now the wind of change appear to be blow more strongly than ever in the world of communism as well as own for have sail with those wind at back and with the tide of human freedom in favor steer ship with hope as thomas|jefferson say leave fear astern today still welcome those wind of change and have every reason to believe that tide be run strong with thank to almighty god for see through a perilous passage ask help anew in guide the|"good|ship|union view transcript transcript good evening fellow citizen this government as promise have maintain the close surveillance of the soviet military buildup on the island of cuba within the|past|week unmistakable evidence have establish the fact that a series of offensive missile site be now in preparation on that imprison island the purpose of these basis can be none other than to provide a nuclear strike capability against the|western|hemisphere upon receive the first preliminary hard information of this nature last|tuesday morning at direct that surveillance be step up and have now confirm and complete evaluation of the evidence and decision on a course of action this government feel oblige to report this new crisis to in full detail the characteristic of these new missile site indicate distinct type of installation several of include medium range ballistic missile capable of carry a nuclear warhead for a distance of more|than|1,000 nautical mile each of these missile in short be capable of strike washington d.c. the|panama|canal cape|canaveral mexico|city or any other city in the southeastern part of the|united|state in central|america or in the caribbean area additional site not yet complete appear to be design for intermediate range bailistic missile capable of travel more than twice as far and thus capable of strike most of the major city in the|western|hemisphere range as far north as hudson|bay canada and as far south as lima peru in addition jet bomber capable of carry nuclear weapon be now be uncrated and assemble in cuba while the necessary air basis be be prepare this urgent transformation of cuba into an important strategic base by the presence of these large long range and clearly offensive weapon of sudden mass destruction constitute an explicit threat to the peace and security of all the americas in flagrant and deliberate defiance of the|rio|pact of the tradition of this nation and hemisphere the joint resolution of the 87th congress the charter of the|united|nation and own public warning to the soviets on september|4|and|13 this action also contradict the repeat assurance of soviet spokesman both publicly and privately deliver that the arm buildup in cuba would retain original defensive character and that the|soviet|union have no need or desire to station strategic missile on the territory of any other nation the size of this undertaking make clear that have be plan for some|months yet only|last|month after have make clear the distinction between any introduction of ground to ground missile and the existence of defensive antiaircraft missile the|soviet|government publicly state on september|11 that and quote the armament and military equipment send to cuba be design exclusively for defensive purpose that and quote the|soviet|government there be no need for the|soviet|government to shift weapon for a retaliatory blow to any other country for instance cuba and that and quote government the|soviet|union have so powerful rocket to carry these nuclear warhead that there be no need to search for site for beyond the boundary of the|soviet|union that statement be false only last|thursday as evidence of this rapid offensive buildup be already in hand soviet foreign minister gromyko tell in office that be instruct to make clear once again as say government have already do that soviet assistance to cuba and quote pursue solely the purpose of contribute to the defense capability of cuba that and quote training by soviet specialist of cuban national in handle defensive armament be by no mean offensive and if be otherwise mr. gromyko go on would never become involved in render such assistance that statement also be false neither nor the world community of nation can tolerate deliberate deception and offensive threat on the part of any nation large or small no longer live in a world where only the actual firing of weapon represent a sufficient challenge to a nation 's security to constitute maximum peril nuclear weapon be so destructive and ballistic missile be so swift that any substantially increase possibility of use or any sudden change in deployment may well be regard as a definite threat to peace for many|years both the|soviet|union and the|united|state recognize this fact have deploy strategic nuclear weapon with great care never upset the precarious status quo which insure that these weapon would not be use in the absence of some vital challenge own strategic missile have never be transfer to the territory of any other nation under a cloak of secrecy and deception and history unlike that of the soviets since the end of world|war|ii demonstrate that have no desire to dominate or conquer any other nation or impose system upon people nevertheless american citizen have become adjust to live daily on the bull's eye of soviet missile locate inside the u.s.s.r. or in submarine in that sense missile in cuba add to an already clear and present danger although should be note the nation of latin|america have never previously be subject to a potential nuclear threat but this secret swift and extraordinary buildup of communist missile in an area well know to have a special and historical relationship to the|united|state and the nation of the|western|hemisphere in violation of soviet assurance and in defiance of american and hemispheric policy this sudden clandestine decision to station strategic weapon for the first time outside of soviet soil be a deliberately provocative and unjustified change in the status quo which can not be accept by this country if courage and commitment be ever to be trust again by either friend or foe the 's teach a clear lesson aggressive conduct if allow to go unchecked and unchallenged ultimately lead to war this nation be oppose to war be also true to word unswerving objective therefore must be to prevent the use of these missile against this or any other country and to secure withdrawal or elimination from the|western|hemisphere policy have be of patience and restraint as befit a peaceful and powerful nation which lead a worldwide alliance have be determine not to be divert from central concern by mere irritant and fanatic but now further action be require and be under way and these action may only be the beginning will not prematurely or unnecessarily risk the cost of worldwide nuclear war in which even the fruit of victory would be ashe in mouth but neither will shrink from that risk at any time must be face acting therefore in the defense of own security and of the entire western|hemisphere and under the authority entrust to by the constitution as endorse by the resolution of the congress have direct that the follow initial step be take immediately first to halt this offensive buildup a strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment under shipment to cuba be be initiate all ship of any kind bind for cuba from whatever nation or port will if find to contain cargo of offensive weapon be turn back this quarantine will be extend if need to other type of cargo and carrier be not at this time however deny the necessity of life as the soviets attempt to do in berlin blockade of second have direct the continue and increase close surveillance of cuba and military buildup the foreign minister of the oas in communique of october|6 reject secrecy on such matter in this hemisphere should these offensive military preparation continue thus increase the threat to the hemisphere further action will be justify have direct the|armed|force to prepare for any eventuality and trust that in the interest of both the cuban people and the soviet technician at the site the hazard to all concerned of continue this threat will be recognize third shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile launch from cuba against any nation in the|western|hemisphere as an attack by the|soviet|union on the|united|state require a full retaliatory response upon the|soviet|union fourth as a necessary military precaution have reinforce base at guantanamo evacuate today the dependent of personnel there and order additional military unit to be on a standby alert basis fifth be call tonight for an immediate meeting of under the|organization|of|american|state to consider this threat to hemispheric security and to invoke article and of the|rio|treaty in support of all necessary action the|united|nations|charter allow for regional security arrangement and the nation of this hemisphere decide long ago against the military presence of outside power other ally around the world have also be alert sixth under the charter of the|united|nation be ask tonight that an emergency meeting of the|security|council be convoke without delay to take action against this late soviet threat to world peace resolution will call for the prompt dismantling and withdrawal of all offensive weapon in cuba under the supervision of u.n. observer before the quarantine can be lift seventh and finally call upon chairman khrushchev to halt and eliminate this clandestine reckless and provocative threat to world peace and to stable relation between nation call upon further to abandon this course of world domination and to join in an historic effort to end the perilous arm race and to transform the history of man have an opportunity now to move the world back from the abyss of destruction by return to government 's own word that have no need to station missile outside own territory and withdraw

present case against the soviet threat to peace and own proposal for a peaceful world at any time and in any forum in the oas in the|united|nation or in any other meeting that could be useful without limit freedom of action have in the past make strenuous effort to limit the spread of nuclear weapon have propose the elimination of all arm and military basis in a fair and effective disarmament treaty be prepared to discuss new proposal for the removal of tension on both side include the possibility of a genuinely independent cuba free to determine own destiny have no wish to war with the|soviet|union for be a peaceful people who desire to live in peace with all other people but be difficult to settle or even discuss these problem in an atmosphere of intimidation that be why this late soviet threat or any other threat which be make either independently or in response to action this|week must and will be meet with determination any hostile move anywhere in the world against the safety and freedom of people to whom be commit include in particular the brave people of west|berlin will be meet by whatever action be need finally want to say a few word to the captive people of cuba to whom this speech be be directly carry by special radio facility speak to as a friend as who know of deep attachment to fatherland as who share aspiration for liberty and justice for all and have watch and the american people have watch with deep sorrow how nationalist revolution be betray and how fatherland fall under foreign domination now leader be no longer cuban leader inspire by cuban ideal be puppet and agent of an international conspiracy which have turn cuba against friend and neighbor in the americas and turn into the first latin|american country to become a target for nuclear war the first latin|american country to have these weapon on soil these new weapon be not in interest contribute nothing to peace and well being can only undermine but this country have no wish to cause to suffer or to impose any system upon know that life and land be be use as pawn by those who deny freedom many time in the past the cuban people have rise to throw out tyrant who destroy liberty and have no doubt that most cubans today look forward to the time when will be truly free free from foreign domination free to choose own leader free to select own system free to own own land free to speak and write and worship without fear or degradation and then shall cuba be welcome back to the society of free nation and to the association of this hemisphere fellow citizen let no one doubt that this be a difficult and dangerous effort on which have set out no one can foresee precisely what course will take or what cost or casualty will be incur many|month of sacrifice and self discipline lie ahead month in which both patience and will be test month in which many threat and denunciation will keep aware of danger but the great danger of all would be to do nothing the path have choose for the present be full of hazard as all path be but be the most consistent with character and courage as a nation and commitment around the world the cost of freedom be always high but americans have always pay and path shall never choose and that be the path of surrender or submission goal be not the victory of might but the vindication of right not peace at the expense of freedom but both peace and freedom here in this hemisphere and hope around the world god willing that goal will be achieve thank and good night view transcript transcript the order of the court in the case of meredith versus fair be begin to be carry out mr. james|meredith be now in residence on the campus of the|university|of|mississippi this have be accomplish thus far without the use of national|guard or other troop and be to be hope that the law enforcement officer of the state of mississippi and the|federal|marshal will continue to be sufficient in the future all student member of the faculty and public official in both mississippi and the nation will be able be hope to return to normal activity with full confidence in the integrity of american law this be as should be for nation be found on the principle that observance of the law be the eternal safeguard of liberty and defiance of the law be the sure road to tyranny the law which obey include the final ruling of the court as well as the enactment 's of legislative body even among law abide man few law be universally love but be uniformly respect and not resist americans be free in short to disagree with the law but not to disobey for in a government of law and not of man no man however prominent or powerful and no mob however unruly or boisterous be entitle to defy a court of law if this country should ever reach the point where any man or group of man by force or threat of force could long defy the command of court and constitution then no law would stand free from doubt no judge would be sure of writ and no citizen would be safe from neighbor in this case in which the|united|states|government be not until recently involve mr. meredith bring a private suit in federal court against those who be exclude from the university a series of federal court all the way to the|supreme|court repeatedly order mr. meredith 's admission to the university when those order be defy and those who seek to implement threaten with arrest and violence the|united|states|court|of|appeal consist of chief judge tuttle of georgia judge hutcheson of texas judge rives|of|alabama judge jones of florida judge brown of texas judge wisdom of louisiana judge gewin of alabama and judge bell of georgia make clear the fact that the enforcement of order have become an obligation of the|united|states|government even though this government have not originally be a party to the case responsibility as president be therefore inescapable accept obligation under the constitution and the statute of the|united|state be and be to implement the order of the court with whatever mean be necessary and with as little force and civil disorder as the circumstance permit be for this reason that federalize the|mississippi|national|guard as the most appropriate instrument should any be need to preserve law and order while united|stat marshal carry out the order of the court and prepare to back up with whatever other civil or military enforcement may have be require deeply regret the fact that any action by the executive branch be necessary in this case but all other avenue and alternative include persuasion and conciliation have be try and exhaust have the police power of mississippi be use to support the order of the court instead of deliberately and unlawfully block have the|university|of|mississippi fulfil standard of excellence by quietly admit this applicant in conformity with what so many other southern state university have do for so|many|year a peaceable and sensible solution would have be possible without any federal intervention this nation be proud of the many instance in which governors educator and everyday citizen from the south have show to the world the gain that can be make by persuasion and good will in a society rule by law specifically would like to take this occasion to express the thank of this nation to those southerner who have contribute to the progress of democratic development in the entrance of student regardless of race to such great institution as the state support university of virginia north|carolina georgia florida texas louisiana tennessee arkansas and kentucky recognize that the present period of transition and adjustment in nation 's southland be a hard for many people neither mississippi nor any other southern state deserve to be charge with all the accumulate wrong of of race relation to the extent that there have be failure the responsibility for that failure must be share by all by every state by every citizen mississippi and university moreover be note for courage for contribution of talent and think to the affair of this nation this be the|state|of|lucius|lamar and many other who have place the national good ahead of sectional interest this be the state which have medal|of|honor winner in the korean war alone in fact the guard unit federalize this|morning early be part of the|155th|infantry of the old regiment in the union and of the most decorated for sacrifice and bravery in war in a mississippi sergeant jake|lindsey be honor by an unusual joint session of the congress close therefore with this appeal to the student of the university the people who be most concerned have a great tradition to uphold a tradition of honor and courage win on the field of battle and on the gridiron as well as the university campus have a new opportunity to show that be man of patriotism and integrity for the most effective mean of uphold the law be not the state policeman or the marshal or the|national|guard be lie in courage to accept those law with which disagree as well as those with which agree the eye of the nation and of all the world be upon and upon all of and the honor of university and state be in the balance be certain that the great majority of the student will uphold that honor there be in short no reason why the book on this case can not now be quickly and quietly close in the manner direct by the court let preserve both the law and the peace and then heal those wound that be within can turn to the great crisis that be without and stand united as people in pledge to man 's freedom thank and good night view transcript transcript president pitzer mr. vice president governor congressman thomas senator wiley and congressman|miller mr. webb mr.

be particularly delighted to be here on this occasion meet at a college note for knowledge in a city note for progress in a state note for strength and stand in need of all for meet in an hour of change and challenge in a|decade of hope and fear in an age of both knowledge and ignorance the great knowledge increase the great ignorance unfold despite the striking fact that most of the scientist that the world have ever know be alive and work today despite the fact that this nation 's own scientific manpower be double every|12|year in a rate of growth more|than|three time that of population as a whole despite that the vast stretch of the unknown and the unanswered and the unfinished still far outstrip collective comprehension no man can fully grasp how far and how fast have come but condense if will the|50,000|year of man 's record history in a time span of but a|half century state in these term know very little about the|first|40|year except at the end of advanced man have learn to use the skin of animal to cover then about|10|years|ago under this standard man emerge from cave to construct other kind of shelter only|5|years|ago man learn to write and use a cart with wheel christianity begin less|than|2|years|ago the printing press come this|year and then less|than|2|months|ago during this whole 50-year span of human history the steam engine provide a new source of

and now if america 's new spacecraft succeed in reach venus will have literally reach the star before midnight|tonight this be a breathtaking pace and such a pace can not help but create new ill as dispel old new ignorance new problem new danger surely the opening vista of space promise high cost and hardship as well as high reward so be not surprising that some would have stay where be a little longer to rest to wait but this city of houston this|state of texas this country of the|united|state be not build by those who wait and rest and wish to look behind this country be conquer by those who move forward and so will space william|bradford speak in of the founding of the|plymouth|bay|colony say that all great and honorable action be accompany with great difficulty and both must be enterprise and overcome with answerable courage if this capsule history of progress teach anything be that man in quest for knowledge and progress be determined and can not be deter the exploration of space will go ahead whether join in or not and be of the great adventure of all time and no nation which expect to be the leader of other nation can expect to stay behind in this race for space those who come before make certain that this country ride the first wave of the industrial revolution the first wave of modern invention and the first wave of nuclear power and this generation do not intend to founder in the backwash of the come age of space mean to be a part of mean to lead for the eye of the world now look into space to the moon and to the planet beyond and have vow that shall not see govern by a hostile flag of conquest but by a banner of freedom and peace have vow that shall not see space fill with weapon of mass destruction but with instrument of knowledge and understanding yet the vow of this nation can only be fulfil if in this nation be first and therefore intend to be first in short leadership in science and in industry hope for peace and security obligation to as well as other all require to make this effort to solve these mystery to solve for the good of all man and to become the world 's lead space fare nation set sail on this new sea because there be new knowledge to be gain and new right to be win and must be win and use for the progress of all people for space science like nuclear science and all technology have no conscience of own whether will become a force for good or ill depend on man and only if the|united|states occupy a position of pre - eminence can help decide whether this new ocean will be a sea of peace or a new terrifying theater of war do not say that should or will go unprotected against the hostile misuse of space any more than go unprotected against the hostile use of land or sea but do say that space can be explore and master without feed the fire of war without repeat the mistake that man have make in extend writ around this globe of there be no strife no prejudice no national conflict in outer space as yet hazard be hostile to all conquest deserve the good of all mankind and opportunity for peaceful cooperation may never come again but why some say the moon why choose this as goal and may well ask why climb the high mountain why fly the atlantic why do rice play texas choose to go to the moon choose to go to the moon in this|decade and do the other thing not because be easy but because be hard because that goal will serve to organize and measure the good of energy and skill because that challenge be that be willing to accept be unwilling to postpone and one which intend to win and the other too be for these reason that regard the decision last|year to shift effort in space from low to high gear as among the most important decision that will be make during incumbency in the|office|of|the|presidency in the|last|24|hour have see facility now be create for the great and most complex exploration in man 's history have feel the ground shake and the air shatter by the testing of a saturn c-1 booster rocket many time as powerful as the atlas which launch john|glenn generate power equivalent to automobile with accelerator on the floor have see the site where f-1 rocket engine each one as powerful as all engine of the saturn combine will be cluster together to make the advanced saturn missile assemble in a new building to be build at cape|canaveral as tall as a 48-story structure as wide as a city block and as long as length of this field within these|last|19|month at least satellite have circle the earth some of be make in the|united|states|of|america and be far more sophisticated and supply far more knowledge to the people of the world than those of the|soviet|union the mariner spacecraft now on way to venus be the most intricate instrument in the history of space science the accuracy of that shot be comparable to fire a missile from cape|canaveral and drop in this stadium between the 40-yard line transit satellite be help ship at sea to steer a safe course tiro satellite have give unprecedented warning of hurricane and storm and will do the same for forest fire and iceberg have have failure but so have other even if do not admit and may be less public to be sure be behind and will be behind for some time in man flight but do not intend to stay behind and in this|decade shall make up and move ahead the growth of science and education will be enrich by new knowledge of universe and environment by new technique of learning and mapping and observation by new tool and computer for industry medicine the home as well as the school technical institution such as rice will reap the harvest of these gain and finally the space effort while still in infancy have already create a great number of new company and tens|of|thousand of new job space and related industry be generate new demand in investment and skilled personnel and this city and this state and this region will share greatly in this growth what be once the furth outpost on the old frontier of the west will be the furth outpost on the new frontier of science and space houston city of houston with manned|spacecraft|center will become the heart of a large scientific and engineering community during the|next|5|years the|national|aeronautics|and|space|administration expect to double the number of scientist and engineer in this area to increase outlay for salary and expense to a year to invest some|$200|million in plant and laboratory facility and to direct or contract for new space effort over from this center in this city to be sure all this cost all a good deal of money this year 's space budget be time what be in january|1961 and be great than the space budget of the|previous|8|years combine that budget now stand at a year a staggering sum though somewhat less than pay for cigarette and cigar every|year space expenditure will soon rise some more from per person per week to more|than|50|cent a week for every man woman and child in the|united|state for have give this program a high national priority even though realize that this be in some measure an act of faith and vision for do not now know what benefit await but if be to say fellow citizen that shall send to the moon away from the control station in houston a giant rocket tall the length of this football field make of new metal alloy some of which have not yet be invent capable of stand heat and stress several time more than have ever be experience fit together with a precision better than the fine watch carry all the equipment need for propulsion guidance control communication food and survival on an untried mission to an unknown celestial body and then return safely to earth reentere the atmosphere at speed of over|25,000|miles|per|hour cause heat about|half that of the temperature of the sun almost as hot as be here today and do all this and do right and do first before this|decade be out then must be bold be the one who be do all the work so just want to stay cool for a|minute laughter however think be go to do and think that must pay what need to be pay do not think ought to waste any money but think ought to do the job and this will be do in may be do while some of be still here at school at this college and university will be do during the term of office of some of the people who sit here on this platform but will be do and will be do before be delighted that this university be play a part in put a man on the moon as part of a great national effort of many|years|ago the great british explorer george|mallory who be to die on mount|everest be ask why do want to climb say because be there well space be there and be go to climb and the moon and the planet be there and new hope for knowledge and peace be there and therefore as set sail ask god 's blessing on the most hazardous and dangerous and great adventure on which man have ever embark thank view transcript transcript president griswold member of the faculty graduate and family lady and gentleman let begin by express appreciation for the very deep honor that have confer upon as general de|gaulle occasionally acknowledge america to be the daughter of europe so be pleased to come to yale the daughter of harvard may be say now that have the good of both world a harvard education and a yale degree be particularly glad to become a yale man because as think about trouble find that a lot of have come from other yale man among businessman have have a minor disagreement with roger|blough of the law school class of and have have some complaint too from friend henry|ford of the class of in journalism seem to have a difference with john|hay|whitney of the class of and sometimes also displease henry|luce of the class of not to mention also william|f.|buckley jr. of the class of even have some trouble with yale adviser get along with but be not always sure how get along with each other have the warm feeling for chester|bowle of the class of and for dean|acheson of the class of and assistant mcgeorge|bundy of the class of but be not sure that these wise and experience yale man wholly agree with each other on every issue so this administration which aim at peaceful cooperation among all americans have be the victim of a certain natural pugnacity develop in this city among yale man now that too be a yale man be time for peace last|week at west|point in the historic tradition of that academy avail of the power of commander in chief to remit all sentence of offend cadet in that same spirit and in the historic tradition of yale let now offer to smoke the clay pipe of friendship with all of brother ells and hope that may be friend not only with but even with each other in any event be very glad to be here and as a new member of the club have be check to see what early link exist between the institution of the presidency and yale find that a member of the class of william|howard|taft serve term in the|white|house as preparation for become a member of this faculty and a graduate of john|c.|calhoun regard the vice presidency quite naturally as too lowly a status for a yale alumnus and become the only man in history to ever resign that office calhoun in and taft in graduate into a world very different from ours today and contemporary spend entire career stretch over|40|year in grapple with a few dramatic issue on which the nation be sharply and emotionally divide issue that occupy the attention of a generation at a time the national bank the disposal of the public land nullification or union freedom or slavery gold or silver today these old sweeping issue very largely have disappear the central domestic issue of time be more subtle and less simple relate not to basic clash of philosophy or ideology but to way and mean of reach common goal to research for sophisticated solution to complex and obstinate issue the world of calhoun the world of taft have own hard problem and notable challenge but problem be not problem age be not age as every past generation have have to disenthrall from an inheritance of truism and stereotype so in own time must move on from the reassuring repetition of stale phrase to a new difficult but essential confrontation with reality for the great enemy of the truth be very often not the lie deliberate contrive and dishonest but the myth — persistent persuasive and unrealistic too often hold fast to the cliche of forebear subject all fact to a prefabricate set of interpretation enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought mythology distract everywhere in government as in business in politic as in economic in foreign affair as in domestic affair but today want to particularly consider the myth and reality in national economy in recent|month many have come to feel as do that the dialog between the party between business and government between the government and the public be clog by illusion and platitude and fail to reflect the true reality of contemporary american society speak of these matter here at yale because of the self evident truth that a great university be always enlist against the spread of illusion and on the side of reality no one have say more clearly than president griswold liberal learning be both a safeguard against false idea of freedom and a source of true one role as university man whatever calling will be to increase each new generation 's grasp of duty there be great area of domestic affair in which today there be a danger that illusion may prevent effective action be first the question of the size and the shape of government 's responsibility the question of public fiscal policy and third the matter of confidence business confidence or public confidence or simply confidence in america want to talk about all and want to talk about carefully and dispassionately — and emphasize that be concern here not with political debate but with find way to separate false problem from real one if a contest in angry argument be force upon no administration could shrink from response and history do not suggest that american|president be totally without resource in an engagement force upon because of hostility in sector of society but in the wide national interest need not partisan wrangling but common concentration on common problem come here to this distinguished university to ask to join in this great task let take first the question of the size and shape of government the myth here be that government be big and bad and steadily get big and bad obviously this myth have some excuse for existence be true that in recent history each new administration have spend much more money than predecessor thus president roosevelt outspent president hoover and with allowance for the special case of the|second|world|war president truman outspent president roosevelt just to prove that this be not a partisan matter president eisenhower then outspent president truman by the handsome figure of be even possible some think that this trend may continue but do follow from this that big government be grow relatively big do not — for the fact be for the|last|15|year the|federal|government and also the federal debt and also the federal bureaucracy — have grow less rapidly than the economy as a whole if leave defense and space expenditure aside since the|second|world|war have expand less than any other major sector of national life less than industry less than commerce less than agriculture less than high education and very much less than the noise about big government the truth about big government be the truth about any other great activity be complex certainly be true that size bring danger but be also true that size can bring benefit here at yale which have contribute so much to national progress in science and medicine may be proper for to mention great and little noticed expansion of government which have bring strength to whole society the new role of federal|government as the major patron of research in science and in medicine few people realize that in in support of all university research in science and medicine three|dollar out of every come from the|federal|government need hardly point out that this have take place without undue enlargement of government control — that american scientist remain second to none in independence and in individualism be not suggest that federal expenditure can not bring some measure of control the whole thrust of federal expenditure in agriculture have be relate by purpose and design to control as a means of deal with the problem create by farmer and grow productivity each sector point be of activity must be approach on own merit and in term of specific national need generality in regard to federal expenditure therefore can be mislead each case science urban renewal education agriculture natural resource each case must be determine on merit if be to profit from unrivaled ability to combine the strength of public and private purpose next let turn to the problem of fiscal policy here the myth be legion and the truth hard to find but let take as a prime example the problem of the federal budget persist in measure federal fiscal integrity today by the conventional or administrative budget with result which would be regard as absurd in any business firm in any country of europe — or in any careful assessment of the reality of national finance the administrative budget have sound administrative us but for wide purpose be less helpful omit special trust fund and the effect that have on economy neglect change in asset or inventory can not tell a loan from a straight expenditure and bad of all can not distinguish between operate expenditure and long term investment this budget in relation to the great problem of federal|fiscal policy which be basic to economy in be not simply irrelevant can be actively mislead and yet there be a mythology that measure all of national soundness or unsoundness on the single simple basis of this same annual administrative budget if federal budget be to serve not the debate but the country must and will find way of clarify this area of discourse still in the area of fiscal policy let say a word about deficit the myth persist that federal deficit create inflation and budget surplus prevent yet sizeable budget surplus after the war do not prevent inflation and persistent deficit for the|last|several|year have not upset basic price stability obviously deficit be sometimes dangerous and so be surplus but honest assessment plainly require a more sophisticated view than the old and automatic cliche that deficit automatically bring inflation there be myth also about public debt be widely suppose that this debt be grow at a dangerously rapid rate in fact both the debt per person and the debt as a proportion of gross national product have decline sharply since in absolute term the national debt since the end of world|war|ii have increase only|8|percent while private debt be increase and the debt of state and local government on whom people frequently suggest should place additional burden the debt of state and local government have increase moreover debt public and private be neither good nor bad in and of borrowing can lead to over extension and collapse but can also lead to expansion and strength there be no single simple slogan in this field that can trust finally come to the problem of confidence confidence be a matter of myth and also a matter of truth and this time let take the truth of the matter first be true and of high importance that the prosperity of this country depend on the assurance that all major element within will live up to responsibility if business be to neglect obligation to the public if labor be blind to all public responsibility above all if government be to abandon obvious and statutory duty of watchful concern for economic health if any of these thing should happen then confidence may well be weaken and the danger of stagnation would increase this be the true issue of confidence but there be also the false issue and simple form be the assertion that any and all unfavorable turn of the speculative wheel however temporary and however plainly speculative in character be the result of and quote a lack of confidence in the national administration this must tell while comfort be not wholly true bad obscure the reality which be also simple the solid ground of mutual confidence be the necessary partnership of government with all of the sector of society in the steady quest for economic progress corporate plan be not base on a political confidence in party leader but on an economic confidence in the nation 's ability to invest and produce and consume business have full confidence in the administration in power in and this be not enough to prevent recession when business lack full confidence in the economy what matter be the capacity of the nation as a whole to deal with economic problem and opportunity the stereotype have be discuss distract attention and divide effort these stereotype do nation a disservice not just because be exhausted and irrelevant but above all because be mislead because stand in the way of the solution of hard and complicated fact be not new that past debate should obscure present reality but the damage of such a false dialogue be great today than ever before simply because today the safety of all the world the very future of freedom depend as never before upon the sensible and clearheaded management of the domestic affair of the|united|state the real issue of time be rarely as dramatic as the issue of calhoun the difference today be usually matter of degree and can not understand and attack contemporary problem in if be bind by traditional label and wear out slogan of an early era but the unfortunate fact of the matter be that rhetoric have not keep pace with the speed of social and economic change political debate public discourse on current domestic and economic issue — too often bear little or no relation to the actual problem the|united|stat face what be at stake in economic decision today be not some grand warfare of rival ideology which will sweep the country with passion but the practical management of a modern economy what need be not label and cliche but more basic discussion of the sophisticated and technical question involve in keep a great economic machinery move ahead the national interest lie in high employment and steady expansion of output in stable price and a strong dollar the declaration of such an objective be easy attainment in an intricate and interdependent economy and world be a little more difficult to attain require not some automatic response but hard thought let end by suggest a few of the real question on national agenda first how can budget and tax policy supply adequate revenue and preserve balance of payment position without slow up economic growth how be to set interest rate and regulate the flow of money in way which will stimulate the economy at home without weaken the dollar abroad give the spectrum of domestic and international responsibility what should be the mix between fiscal and monetary policy let give several example from experience of the complexity of these matter and how political label and ideological approach be irrelevant to the solution last|week a distinguished graduate of this school senator proxmire of the class of who be ordinarily regard as a liberal democrat suggest that should follow in meet economic problem a stiff fiscal policy with emphasis on budget balance and an easy monetary policy with low interest rate in order to keep economy go in the|same|week the|bank|for|international|settlement in basel switzerland a conservative organization represent the central banker of europe suggest that the appropriate economic policy in the|united|state should be the very opposite that should follow a flexible budget policy as in europe with deficit when the economy be down and a high monetary policy on interest rate as in europe in order to control inflation and protect goal both may be right or wrong will depend on many different factor the point be that this be basically an administrative or executive problem in which political label or cliche do not give a solution a well know business journal this|morning as journey to raise the prospect that a further budget deficit would bring inflation and encourage the flow of gold have have several budget deficit begin with a deficit in and be true that in the|fall|of|1960 have a gold dollar loss run at annually this would seem to prove the case that a deficit produce inflation and that lose gold yet there be no inflation follow the deficit of nor have there be inflation since then wholesale price index since have remain completely level in spite of several deficit because the loss of gold have be due to other reason price instability relative interest rate relative export import balance national security expenditure all the rest let give a third and final example at the world|bank meeting in september a number of american banker attend predict to european colleague that because of the fiscal|1962 budget deficit there would be a strong inflationary pressure on the dollar and a loss of gold prediction of inflation be share by many in business and help push the market up the recent reality of non - inflation help bring down have have no inflation because have have other factor in economy that have contribute to price stability do not suggest that the government be right and be wrong the fact of the matter be in the|federal|reserve|board and in the administration this|fall a similar view be hold by many well inform and disintereste man that inflation be the major problem that would face in the|winter|of|1962 but be not what do suggest be that these problem be endlessly complicated and yet go to the future of this country and ability to prove to the world what believe must prove be suggest that the problem of fiscal and monetary policy in the|sixty as oppose to the kind of problem face in the thirty demand subtle challenge for which technical answer not political answer must be provide these be matter upon which government and business may and in many case will disagree be certainly matter that government and business should be discuss in the most dispassionate and careful way if to maintain the kind of vigorous upon which country depend how can develop and sustain strong and stable world market for basic commodity without unfairness to the consumer and without undue stimulus to the producer how can generate the buying power which can consume what produce on farm and in factory how can take advantage of the miracle of automation with the great demand that will put upon highly skilled labor and yet offer employment to the|half|million of unskilled school dropout each|year who enter the labor market eight|million of in the 's how do eradicate the barrier which separate substantial minority of citizen from access to education and employment on equal term with the rest how in sum can make free economy work at full capacity that is provide adequate profit for enterprise adequate wage for labor adequate utilization of plant and opportunity for all these be the problem that should be talk about that the political party and the various group in country should be discuss can not be solve by incantation from the forget past but the example of western|europe show that be capable of solution that government and many of be conservative government prepare to face technical problem without ideological preconception can coordinate the element of a national economy and bring about growth and prosperity a decade of some conversation have hear in own country sound like old record long playing leave over from the|middle|thirties the debate of the|thirtie have great significance and produce great result but take place in a different world with different need and different task be responsibility today to live in own world and to identify the need and discharge the task of the 's if there be any current trend toward meet present problem with old cliche this be the moment to stop before land all in a bog of sterile acrimony discussion be essential and be hopeful that the debate of recent|weeks though up to now somewhat barren may represent the start of a serious dialog of the kind which have lead in europe to such fruitful collaboration among all the element of economic society and to a decade of unrivaled economic progress but let not engage in the wrong argument at the wrong time between the wrong people in the wrong country while the real problem of own time grow and multiply fertilize by neglect nearly|150|years|ago thomas|jefferson write the new circumstance under which be place call for new word new phrase and for the transfer of old word to new object new word new phrase the transfer of old word to new object that be truer today than be in the time of jefferson because the role of this country be so vastly more significant there be a show in england call stop|the|world want to get off have not choose to exercise that option be part of the world and must participate in these|days|of|our|year in the solution of the problem that pour upon require the most sophisticated and technical judgment and as work in consonance to meet the authentic problem of time will generate a vision and an energy which will demonstrate anew to the world the superior vitality and the strength of the free society view transcript transcript general westmoreland general lemnitzer mr. secretary general decker general taylor member of the graduate class and parent gentleman want to express appreciation for generous invitation to come to this graduate class be sure that all of who sit here today realize particularly in view of the song have just hear that be part of a long tradition stretch back to of this country 's history and that where sit sit once some of the most celebrated name in nation 's history and also some who be not so well know but who on different battlefield in many war involve every generation of this country 's history have give very clear evidence of commitment to country so that know feel a sense of pride in be part of that tradition and as a citizen of the|united|state as well as president want to express high regard to all of in appreciation for what be do and what will do for country in the|days|ahead would also like to announce at this time that as commander in chief be exercise privilege of direct the secretary of the army and the superintendent of west point to remit all exist confinement and other cadet punishment and hope that will be possible to carry this out today general westmoreland be slightly pained to hear that this be impend in view of the fact that cadet who be confident will some|day be the head of the army have just be remit for and be about to be release but be glad to have the opportunity to participate in the advancement of military career own confinement go for another and a half year and may ask for to be extend instead of remit want to say that wish all of the graduate success while say that be not unmindful of the fact that graduate of this academy have reach the|white|house and neither be a member of party until be more certain that this trend will be break wish that all of may be general and not commanders in chief want to say that be sure recognize that schooling be only interrupt by today 's occasion and not end because the demand that will be make upon in the service of country in the|coming|months and year will be really more pressing and in many way more burdensome as well as more challenging than ever before in history know that many of may feel and many of citizen may feel that in these|day of the nuclear age when war may last in final form a day or two|or|three|days before much of the world be burn up that service to country will be only stand and wait nothing of course could be further from the truth be sure that many americans believe that the|days before world|war|ii be the golden age when the star be fall on all the graduate of west|point that that be the golden time of service and that have move into a period where military service while vital be not as challenging as be then nothing could be further from the truth the fact of the matter be that the period just ahead in the|next|decade will offer more opportunity for service to the graduate of this academy than ever before in the history of the|united|state because all around the world in country which be heavily engage in the maintenance of freedom graduate of this academy be heavily involved whether be in viet nam or in laos or in thailand whether be a military advisory group in iran whether be a military attach in some latin|american country during a difficult and challenging period whether be the commander of troop in south|korea the burden that will be place upon when fill those position as must inevitably will require more from than ever before in history the graduate of west|point and in the|next|10|year will have the great opportunity for the defense of freedom that this academy 's graduate have ever have and be sure that the|joint|chiefs|of|staff endorse that view know as do and do the heavy burden that be require of this academy 's graduate every day general tucker in laos or general|harkins in viet nam and a|dozen other who hold key and significant position involve the security of the|united|state and the defense of freedom be go to follow in footstep and must say that think that will be privilege in the|years|ahead to find yourself so heavily involved in the great interest of this country therefore hope that realize and hope every american realize how much depend upon strictly military responsibility therefore will require a versatility and an adaptability never before require in either war or in peace may involve the command and control of modern nuclear weapon and modern delivery system so complex that only a few scientist can understand operation so devastating that inadvertent use would be of worldwide concern but so new that employment and effect have never be test in combat condition on the other hand responsibility may involve the command of more traditional force but in less traditional role man risk life not as combatant but as instructor or adviser or as symbol of nation 's commitment the fact that the|united|states be not directly at war in these area in no way diminish the skill and the courage that will be require the service to country which be render or the pain of the casualty which be suffer to cite final example of the range of responsibility that will fall upon may hold a position of command with special force force which be too unconventional to be call conventional force which be grow in number and importance and significance for now know that be wholly misleading to call this the nuclear age or to say that security rest only on the doctrine of massive retaliation korea have not be the only battleground since the end of the|second|world|war man have fight and die in malaya in greece in the philippines in algeria and cuba and cyprus and almost continuously on the|indo chinese|peninsula no nuclear weapon have be fire no massive nuclear retaliation have be consider appropriate this be another type of war new in intensity ancient in origin war by guerrilla subversive insurgent assassin war by ambush instead of by combat by infiltration instead of aggression seek victory by erode and exhaust the enemy instead of engage be a form of warfare uniquely adapt to what have be strangely call war of liberation to undermine the effort of new and poor country to maintain the freedom that have finally achieve prey on economic unrest and ethnic conflict require in those situation where must counter and these be the kind of challenge that will be before in the|next|decade if freedom be to be save a whole new kind of strategy a wholly different kind of force and therefore a new and wholly different kind of military training but have speak thus far only of the military challenge which education must prepare for the nonmilitary problem which will face will also be most demanding diplomatic political and economic in the|years|ahead some of will serve as adviser to foreign aid mission or even to foreign government some will negotiate term of a cease fire with broad political as well as military ramification some of will go to the far corner of the earth and to the far reach of space some of will sit in the high council of the pentagon other will hold delicate command post which be international in character still other will advise on plan to abolish arm instead of use to abolish other whatever position the scope of decision will not be confine to the traditional tenet of military competence and training will need to know and understand not only the foreign policy of the|united|state but the foreign policy of all country scatter around the world who 20|years|ago be the most distant name to will need to give order in different tongue and read map by different system will be involve in economic judgment which most economist would hesitate to make at what point for example do military aid become burdensome to a country and make freedom endanger rather than help to secure to what extent can the gold and dollar cost of overseas deployment be offset by foreign procurement or at what stage can a new weapon system be consider sufficiently advanced to justify large dollar appropriation in many country posture and performance will provide the local population with the only evidence of what country be really like in other country military mission advice and action will play a key role in determine whether those people will remain free will need to understand the importance of military power and also the limit of military power to decide what arm should be use to fight and when should be use to prevent a fight to determine what represent vital interest and what interest be only marginal above all will have a responsibility to deter war as well as to fight for the basic problem face the world today be not susceptible of a final military solution while will long require the service and admire the dedication and commitment of the fight man of this country neither strategy nor psychology as a nation and certainly not economy must become permanently dependent upon an ever increase military establishment force therefore must fulfill a broad role as a complement to diplomacy as an arm of diplomacy as a deterrent to adversary and as a symbol to ally of determination to support that be why this academy have see curriculum grow and expand in dimension in substance and in difficulty that be why can not possibly have crowd into these|4|busy|year all of the knowledge and all of the range of experience which must bring to these subtle and delicate task which have describe and that be why go to school year after year so can serve this country to the good of ability and talent to talk of such talent and effort raise in the mind be sure of everyone and the mind of all of countryman why why should man such as able to master the complex art of science mathematic language economy and all the rest devote life to a military career with all of risk and hardship why should family be expect to make the personal and financial sacrifice that a military career inevitably bring with when there be a visible enemy to fight in open combat the answer be not so difficult many serve all applaud and the tide of patriotism run high but when there be a long slow struggle with no immediate visible foe choice will seem hard indeed and will recall be sure the line find in an old sentry box in gibraltar god and the soldier all man adore in time of trouble and no more for when war be over and all thing right god be neglect and the old soldier slight but have satisfaction however difficult those|day may be when be ask by a president of the|united|state or by any other american what be do for country no man 's answer will be clear than own and that moral motivation which bring here in the first place be part of training here as well west|point be not build to produce technical expert alone be build to produce man commit to the defense of country leader of man who understand the great stake which be involve leader who can be entrust with the heavy responsibility which modern weapon and the fight for freedom entail leader who can inspire in man the same sense of obligation to duty which bring to there be no single slogan that can repeat to in hard day or give to those who may be associate with in time past a simple phrase or fight or to make the world safe for democracy"-that be enough but the time the weapon and the issue be now more complicated than ever eighteen|years|ago today ernie|pyle describe those tens|of|thousand of young man who cross the ageless and indifferent sea of the|english|channel search in vain for a word to describe what be fight for and finally conclude that be at least fight for each other and leave here today to meet separate responsibility to protect nation 's vital interest by peaceful mean if possible by resolute action if necessary and go forth confident of support and success because know that be work and fight for each other and for all those man and woman all over the globe who be determined to be free view transcript transcript mr. president governor brown dr. pauley chancellor member of the|board|of|regents member of the faculty and fellow student lady and gentleman the last time that come to this stadium be when visit in november|of|1940 as a student at a nearby small school for the game with stanford and get a must say have a much warm reception today than do from coast friend here on that occasion in those|days use to fill these university for football and now do for academic event and be not sure that this do not represent a rather dangerous trend for the future of country be delighted to be here on this occasion for though be the 94th anniversary of the charter in a sense this be the hundredth anniversary for this university and so many other university across country owe birth to the most extraordinary piece of legislation which this country have ever adopt and that be the|morrill|act sign by president abraham|lincoln in the dark and most uncertain day of the|civil|war which set before the country the opportunity to build the great land grant college of which this be so distinguish a part six|years|later this university obtain charter in first graduating class include a future governor of california a future congressman a judge a state assemblyman a clergyman a lawyer a doctor all in a graduate class of student this college therefore from early beginning have recognize and graduate have recognize that the purpose of education be not merely to advance the economic self interest of graduate the people of california as much if not more than the people of any other state have support college and university and school because recognize how important be to the maintenance of a free society that citizen be well educate every man say professor woodrow|wilson send out from a university should be a man of nation as well as a man of time and prince|bismarck be even more specific one|third say of the student of german university break down from overwork another third break down from dissipation and the other third rule germany do not know which third of student be here today but be confident that be talk to the future leader of this state and country who recognize responsibility to the public interest today carry on that tradition distinguished and courageous secretary of defense distinguished secretary of state the chairman of the|atomic|energy|commission the director of the cia and other all be graduate of this university be a disturbing fact to and may be to some of that the new frontier owe as much to berkeley as do to harvard|university this have be a|week of momentous event around the world the long and painful struggle in algeria which come to an end both nuclear power and neutral labor at geneva for a solution to the problem of a spiral arm race and also to the problem that so vex relation with the|soviet|union the congress open hearing on a trade bill which be far more than a trade bill but an opportunity to build a strong and close atlantic|community and wife have first and last ride on an elephant but history may well remember this as a|week for an act of less immediate impact and that be the decision by the|united|state and the|soviet|union to seek concrete agreement on the joint exploration of space experience have teach that an agreement to negotiate do not always mean a negotiate agreement but should such a joint effort be realize significance could well be tremendous for all in term of space science combined knowledge and effort can benefit the people of all the nation joint weather satellite to provide more ample warning against destructive storm joint communication system to draw the world more closely together and cooperation in space medicine research and space tracking operation to speed the|day when man will go to the moon and beyond but the scientific gain from such a joint effort would offer believe less realize return than the gain for world peace for a cooperative soviet american effort in space science and exploration would emphasize the interest that must unite rather than those that always divide offer an area in which the stale and sterile dogma of the cold war could be literally leave a|quarter of|a|million|miles behind and would remind on both side that knowledge not hate be the passkey to the future that knowledge transcend national antagonism that speak a universal language that be the possession not of a single class or of a single nation or a single ideology but of all mankind need hardly emphasize the happy pursuit of knowledge in this place faculty include more nobel laureate than any other faculty in the world more in this community than principal adversary have receive since the award begin in and take pride in that only from a national point of view because indicate as the chancellor point out the great intellectual benefit of a free society this|university|of|california will continue to grow as an intellectual center because president and chancellor and professor have rigorously defend that unhampered freedom of discussion and inquiry which be the soul of the intellectual enterprise and the heart of a free university may be proud as a nation of record in scientific achievement but at the same time must be impress by the interdependence of all knowledge be certain that every scholar and scientist here today would agree that own work have benefit immeasurably from the work of the man and woman in other country the prospect of a partnership with soviet scientist in the exploration of space open up exciting prospect of collaboration in other area of learning and cooperation in the pursuit of knowledge can hopefully lead to cooperation in the pursuit of peace yet the pursuit of knowledge imply a world where man be free to follow out the logic of own idea imply a world where nation be free to solve own problem and to realize own ideal imply in short a world where collaboration emerge from the voluntary decision of nation strong in own independence and own self respect imply believe the kind of world which be emerge before eye the world produce by the revolution of national independence which have today and have be since sweep across the face of the world sometimes think that be too much impress by the clamor of daily event the newspaper headline and the television screen give a short view so flood with the stop press detail of daily story that lose sight of of the great movement of history yet be the profound tendency of history and not the pass excitement that will shape future the short view give the impression as a nation of be shove and harry everywhere on the defense but this impression be surely an optical illusion from the perspective of moscow the world today may seem ever more troublesome more intractable more frustrating than do to the leader of the communist world be confront not only by acute internal problem in each communist country the failure of agriculture the rise discontent of the youth and the intellectual the demand of technical and managerial group for status and security be confront in addition by profound division within the communist world division which have already shatter the image of communism as a universal system guarantee to abolish all social and international conflict the most valuable asset the communists have for many|years wisdom require the long view and the long view show that the revolution of national independence be a fundamental fact of era this revolution will not be stop as new nation emerge from the oblivion of century first aspiration be to affirm national identity deep hope be for a world where within a framework of international cooperation every country can solve own problem accord to own tradition and ideal be in the interest of the pursuit of .knowledge and be in own national interest that this revolution of national independence succeed for the communists rest everything on the idea of a monolithic world a world where all knowledge have a single pattern all society move toward a single model and all problem and road have a single solution and a single destination the pursuit of knowledge on the other hand rest everything on the opposite idea on the idea of a world base on diversity self determination freedom and that be the kind of world to which americans as a nation be commit by the principle upon which the great republic be found as man conduct the pursuit of knowledge create a world which freely unite national diversity and international partnership this emerge world be incompatible with the communist world order will irresistibly burst the bond of the communist organization and the communist ideology and diversity and independence far from be oppose to the american conception of world order represent the very essence of view of the future of the world there use to be so much talk a|few|years|ago about the inevitable triumph of communism hear such talk much less now no one who examine the modern world can doubt that the great current of history be carry the world away from the monolithic idea towards the pluralistic idea away from communism and towards national independence and freedom no one can doubt that the wave of the future be not the conquest of the world by a single dogmatic creed but the liberation of the diverse energy of free nation and free man no one can doubt that cooperation in the pursuit of knowledge must lead to freedom of the mind and freedom of the soul beyond the drumfire of daily crisis therefore there be arise the outline of a robust and vital world community found on nation secure in own independence and unite by allegiance to world peace would be foolish to say that this world will be win tomorrow or the|day after the process of history be fitful and uncertain and aggravating there will be frustration and setback there will be time of anxiety and gloom the specter of thermonuclear war will continue to hang over mankind and must heed the advice of oliver|wendell|holme of freedom lean on spear until all nation be wise enough to disarm safely and effectively yet can have a new confidence today in the direction in which history be move nothing be more stirring than the recognition of great public purpose every great age be mark by innovation and daring by the ability to meet unprecedented problem with intelligent solution in a time of turbulence and change be more true than ever that knowledge be power for only by true understanding and steadfast judgment be able to master the challenge of history if this be so must strive to acquire knowledge and to apply with wisdom must reject over simplify theory of international life the theory that american power be unlimited or that the american mission be to remake the world in the american image must seize the vision of a free and diverse world and shape policy to speed progress toward a more flexible world order this be the unifying spirit of policy in the world today the purpose of aid program must be to help develop country move forward as rapidly as possible on the road to genuine national independence military policy must assist nation to protect the process of democratic reform and development against disruption and intervention diplomatic policy must strengthen relation with the whole world with several alliance and within the|united|nation as press forward on every front to realize a flexible world order the role of the university become ever more important both as a reservoir of idea and as a repository of the long view of the shore dimly see knowledge be the great sun of the firmament say senator daniel|webster life and power be scatter with all beam in light must think and act not only for the moment but for time be remind of the story of the great french marshal|lyautey who once ask gardener to plant a tree the gardener object that the tree be slow grow and would not reach maturity for a|hundred|years the marshal reply in that case there be no time to lose plant this afternoon today a world of knowledge a world of cooperation a just and last peace may be year away but have no time to lose let plant tree this|afternoon view transcript transcript mr. vice president

override obligation in the|months|ahead be to fulfill the world 's hope by fulfil own faith that task must begin at home for if can not fulfill own ideal here can not expect other to accept and when the young child alive today have grow to the care of manhood position in the world will be determine first of all by what provision make today for education health and opportunity for a good home and a good job and a good life at home begin the|year in the valley of recession complete on the high road of recovery and growth with the help of new congressionally approve or administratively increase stimulant to economy the number of major surplus labor u area have decline from nonagricultural employment have increase by job and the average factory work week have rise to well over 40|hour at year's|end the economy which mr. khrushchev once call a stumble horse be race to new record in consumer spending labor income and industrial production be gratify but be not satisfied too many unemployed be still look for the blessing of prosperity- as those who leave school and farm demand new job automation take old job away to expand growth and job opportunity urge on the congress measure first the|manpower|training|and|development|act to stop the waste of able bodied man and woman who want to work but whose only skill have be replace by a machine or move with a mill or shut down with a mine the|youth|employment|opportunities|act to help train and place not only the one|million young americans who be both out of school and out of work but the six|million young americans enter the labor market in this|decade and third the tax credit for investment in machinery and equipment which combine with planned revision of depreciation allowance will spur modernization growth and ability to compete abroad moreover pleasant as may be to bask in the warmth of recovery let not forget that have suffer recession in the|last|7|years the time to repair the roof be when the sun be shin by fill basic gap in anti - recession protection need first presidential standby authority subject to congressional veto to adjust personal income tax rate downward within a specify range and time to slow down an economic decline before have drag all down second presidential standby authority upon a give rise in the rate of unemployment to accelerate federal and federally aid capital improvement program and third a permanent strengthening of unemployment compensation system to maintain for fellow citizen search for a job who can not find purchasing power and living standard without constant resort as have see in recent|years by the congress and the administration to temporary supplement if enact this part program can show the whole world that a free economy nee not be an unstable economy that a free system nee not leave man unemployed and that a free society be not only the most productive but the most stable form of organization yet fashion by man but recession be only|one enemy of a free economy inflation be another last|year,|1961 despite rise production and demand consumer price hold almost steady and wholesale price decline this be the good record of overall price stability of any comparable period of recovery since the end of world|war|ii inflation too often follow in the shadow of growth while price stability be make easy by stagnation or control but mean to maintain both stability and growth in a climate of freedom first line of defense against inflation be the good sense and public spirit of business and labor keep total increase in wage and profit in step with productivity there be no single statistical test to guide each company and each union but strongly urge for country 's interest and for own to apply the test of the public interest to these transaction within this same framework of growth and wage price stability administration have help keep economy competitive by widen the access of small business to credit and government contract and by step up the drive against monopoly price fixing and racketeering will submit a federal pay reform bill aim at give classified postal and other employee new pay scale more comparable to those of private industry be hold the fiscal|1962 budget deficit far below the level incur after the last recession in and finally be submit for fiscal|1963 a balanced federal|budget this be a joint responsibility require congressional cooperation on appropriation and on source of income in particular first an increase in postal rate to end the postal deficit secondly passage of the tax reform previously urge to remove unwarranted tax preference and to apply to dividend and to interest the same withholding requirement have long apply to wage and third extension of the present excise and corporation tax rate except for those change which will be recommend in a message affect transportation but a strong nation and economy require more than a balanced budget require progress in those program that spur growth and fortify strength a strong america depend on city america 's glory and sometimes america 's shame to substitute sunlight for congestion and progress for decay have step up exist urban renewal and housing program and launch new one redouble the attack on water pollution speeded aid to airport hospital highway and decline mass transit system and secure new weapon to combat organize crime racketeering and youth delinquency assist by the coordinated and hard hit effort of investigative service the fbi the|internal|revenue the|bureau|of|narcotics and many other shall need further anti - crime mass transit and transportation legislation and new tool to fight air pollution and with all this effort under way both equity and commonsense require that nation 's urban area contain fourth of population sit as equal at the cabinet table urge a new department|of|urban|affair and housing a strong america also depend on farm and natural resource american farmer take heart in a|billion|dollar rise in farm income and from a hopeful start on reduce the farm surplus but be still operate under a patchwork accumulation of old law which cost a year in ccc carrying charge alone yet fail to halt rural poverty or boost farm earning task be to master and turn to fully fruitful end the magnificent productivity of farm and farmer the revolution on own countryside stand in the sharp contrast to the repeat farm failure of the communist nation and be a source of pride to all since agricultural output per man hour have actually double without new realistic measure will someday swamp farmer and taxpayer in a national scandal or a farm depression will therefore submit to the congress a new comprehensive farm program tailor to fit the use of land and the supply of each crop to the long range need of the sixty and design to prevent chaos in the|sixty with a program of commonsense also need for the sixty if be to bequeath full national estate to heir a new long range conservation and recreation program expansion of superb national park and forest preservation of authentic wilderness area new start on water and power project as population steadily increase and expand rea generation and transmission loan but america stand for progress in human right as well as economic affair and a strong america require the assurance of full and equal right to all citizen of any race or of any color this administration have show as never before how much could be do through the full use of executive power through the enforcement of law already pass by the congress through persuasion negotiation and litigation to secure the constitutional right of all the right to vote the right to travel without hindrance across state line and the right to free public education issue last|march a comprehensive order to guarantee the right to equal employment opportunity in all federal agency and contractor the vice president 's committee thus create have do much include the voluntary plan for progress which in all section of the country be achieve a quiet but striking success in opening up to all race new professional supervisory and other job opportunity but there be much more to be do by the executive by the court and by the congress among the bill now pende before on which the executive department will comment in detail be appropriate method of strengthen these basic right which have full support the right to vote for example should no longer be deny through such arbitrary device on a local level sometimes abuse such as literacy test and poll taxis as approach the 100th anniversary next|january of the|emancipation|proclamation let the act of every branch of the government and every citizen portray that righteousness do exalt a nation finally a strong america can not neglect the aspiration of citizen the welfare of the needy the health care of the elderly the education of the young for be not develop the nation 's wealth for own sake wealth be the mean and people arc the end all material rich will avail little if do not use to expand the opportunity of people last|year improve the diet of needy people provide more hot lunch and fresh milk to school child build more college dormitory and for the elderly expand private housing nursing home heath service and social security but have just begin to help those least fortunate of all be recommend a new public welfare program stress service instead of support rehabilitation instead of relief and training for useful work instead of prolong dependency to relieve the critical shortage of doctor and dentist and this be a matter which should concern all and expand research urge action to aid medical and dental college and scholarship and to establish new national|institutes|of|health to take advantage of modern vaccination achievement be propose a mass immunization program aim at the virtual elimination of such ancient enemy of child as polio diphtheria whooping cough and tetanus to protect consumer from the careless and the unscrupulous shall recommend improvement in the|food|and|drug law strengthen inspection and standard halt unsafe and worthless product prevent mislead label and crack down on the illicit sale of habit form drug but in matter of health no piece of unfinished business be more important or more urgent than the enactment under the social security system of health insurance for the aged for old citizen have long and more frequent illness high hospital and medical bill and too little income to pay private health insurance help very few for cost be high and coverage limit public welfare can not help those too proud to seek relief but hard press to pay own bill nor can child or grandchild always sacrifice own health budget to meet this constant drain social security have long help to meet the hardship of retirement death and disability now urge that coverage be extend without further delay to provide health insurance for the elderly equally important to strength be the quality of education eight|million adult americans be classify as functionally illiterate this be a disturbing figure reflect in rejection rate reflect in welfare roll and crime rate and shall recommend plan for a massive attack to end this adult illiteracy shall also recommend bill to improve educational quality to stimulate the art and at the college level to provide federal loan for the construction of academic facility and federally finance scholarship if this nation be to grow in wisdom and strength then every able high school graduate should have the opportunity to develop talent yet nearly|half lack either the fund or the facility to attend college enrollment be go to double in college in the short space of the annual cost per student be skyrocket to astronomical level now average a year although almost|half of family earn less|than|$5,000 can not afford such cost but this nation can not afford to maintain military power and neglect brainpower but excellence in education must begin at the elementary level send to the congress last|year a proposal for federal aid to public school construction and teacher ' salary believe that bill which pass the senate and receive house|committee approval offer the minimum amount require by need and in term of across the board aid the maximum scope permit by constitution therefore see no reason to weaken or withdraw that bill and urge passage at this session civilization say h.|g.|wells be a race between education and catastrophe be up to in this congress to determine the winner of that race these be not unrelated measure address to specific gap or grievance in national life be the pattern of intention and the foundation of hope believe in democracy say woodrow|wilson because release the energy of every human being the dynamic of democracy be the power and the purpose of the individual and the policy of this administration be to give to the individual the opportunity to realize own high possibility program be to open to all the opportunity for steady and productive employment to remove from all the handicap of arbitrary or irrational exclusion to offer to all the facility for education and health and welfare to make society the servant of the individual and the individual the source of progress and thus to realize for all the full promise of american life all of these effort at home give meaning to effort abroad since the close of a global civil war have divide and torment mankind but be not military might or high standard of living that have most distinguish from adversary be belief that the state be the servant of the citizen and not master this basic clash of idea and will be but of the force reshape globe sweep as be by the tide of hope and fear by crisis in the headline today that become mere footnote tomorrow both the success and the setback of the|past|year remain on agenda of unfinished business for every apparent blessing contain the seed of danger every area of trouble give out a ray of hope and the unchangeable certainty be that nothing be certain or unchangeable yet basic goal remain the same a peaceful world community of free and independent state free to choose own future and own system so long as do not threaten the freedom of other some may choose form and way that would not choose for but be not for that be choose can welcome diversity the communists can not for offer a world of choice offer the world of coercion and the way of the past show dearly that freedom not coercion be the wave of the future at time goal have be obscure by crisis or endanger by conflict but draw sustenance from basic source of strength --the moral and physical strength of the|united|state united strength of the|atlantic|community regional strength of hemispheric relation --the creative strength of effort in the new and develop nation and peace keep strength of the|united|nation moral and physical strength begin at home as already discuss but include military strength as well so long as fanaticism and fear brood over the affair of man must arm to deter other from aggression in the|past|12|month military posture have steadily improve increase the previous defense budget by not in the expectation of war but for the preservation of peace more than double acquisition rate of polaris submarine double the production capacity for minuteman missile and increase by the number of man bomber stand ready on a alert this|year the combine force level plan under new defense budget include nearly|three|hundred additional polaris and minuteman missile have be precisely calculate to insure the continue strength of nuclear deterrent but strength may be test at many level intend to have at all time the capacity to resist non - nuclear or limited attack as a complement to nuclear capacity not as a substitute have reject any all or nothing posture which would leave no choice but inglorious retreat or unlimited retaliation thus have double the number of ready combat division in the army 's strategic reserve increase troop in europe build up the marines add new sealift and airlift capacity modernize weapon and ammunition expand anti - guerrilla force and increase the active fleet by more|than|70 vessel and tactical air force by nearly|a|dozen wing because need to reach this high long term level of readiness more quickly member of the reserve and national|guard be activate under the act of this congress some disruption and distress be inevitable but the overwhelming majority bear burden and nation 's burden with admirable and traditional devotion in the|coming|year reserve program will be revise army|division will hope replace those guard|division on duty and substantial other increase will boost air|force fighter unit the procurement of equipment and continental defense and warning effort the nation 's first serious civil defense shelter program be under way identify marking and stock space and urge approval of federal incentive for the construction of public fall out shelter in school and hospital and similar center but arm alone be not enough to keep the peace must be keep by man instrument and hope be the|united|nation and see little merit in the impatience of those who would abandon this imperfect world instrument because dislike imperfect world for the trouble of a world organization merely reflect the trouble of the world and if the organization be weaken these trouble can only increase may not always agree with every detailed action take by every officer of the|united|nation or with every voting majority but as an institution should have in the future as have have in the past since inception no strong or more faithful member than the|united|states|of|america in the peace keep strength of the|united|nation be reinforce and those who prefer or predict demise envision a troika in the seat of hammarskiold or red|china inside the assembly have see instead a new vigor under a new secretary general and a fully independent secretariat in make plan for a new forum and principle on disarmament for peace keeping in outer space for of development effort the un fulfil charter 's lofty aim eighteen|months|ago the tangled and turbulent congo present the un with grave challenge the prospect be of chaos or certain big power confrontation with all of hazard and all of risk to and to other today the hope have improve for peaceful conciliation within a united congo this be the objective of policy in this important area no policeman be universally popular particularly when use stick to restore law and order on beat those member who be willing to contribute vote and view but very little else have create a serious deficit by refuse to pay share of special un assessment yet do pay annual assessment to retain vote and a new un bond issue finance special operation for the|next|18|month be to be repay with interest from these regular assessment this be clearly in interest will not only keep the un solvent but require all vote member to pay fair share of activity share of special operation have long be much high than share of the annual assessment and the bond issue will in effect reduce disproportionate obligation and for these reason be urge congress to approve participation with the approval of this congress have undertake in the|past|year a great new effort in outer space aim be not simply to be first on the moon any more than charles|lindbergh 's real aim be to be the first to paris aim be to develop the technique of own country and other country in the field of air and the atmosphere and objective in make this effort which hope will place of citizen on the moon be to develop in a new frontier of science commerce and cooperation the position of the|united|state and the|free|world this nation belong among the first to explore and among the first if not the first shall be be offer know how and cooperation to the|united|nation satellite will soon be provide other nation with improve weather observation and shall soon send to the congress a measure to govern the financing and operation of an international|communications|satellite system in a manner consistent with the public interest and foreign policy but peace in space will help naught once peace on earth be go world order will be secure only when the whole world have lay down these weapon which seem to offer present security but threaten the future survival of the human race that armistice day seem very far away the vast resource of this planet be be devote more and more to the mean of destroying instead of enriching human life but the world be not mean to be a prison in which man await execution nor have mankind survive the test and trial of thousands|of|years to surrender everything include existence now this nation have the will and the faith to make a supreme effort to break the log jam on disarmament and nuclear test and will persist until prevail until the rule of law have replace the ever dangerous use of force turn now to a prospect of great promise hemispheric relation the|alliance|for|progress be be rapidly transform from proposal to program last|month in see for the quickening of hope the revival of confidence the new trust in country among worker and farmer as well as diplomat have pledge help in speed economic educational and social progress the|latin|american republics have in turn pledge a new and strenuous effort of self help and self reform to support this historic undertaking be propose under the authority contain in the bill of the last session of the congress a special long term alliance for progress fund of combine with food|for|peace,|export import|bank and other resource this will provide more|than|$1|billion a year in new support for the alliance in addition have increase fold spanish and portuguese language broadcasting in latin|america improve hemispheric trade and defense and while the blight of communism have be increasingly expose and isolate in the americas liberty have score a gain the people of the|dominican|republic with firm encouragement and help and those of sister republics of this hemisphere be safely pass through the treacherous course from dictatorship through disorder towards democracy effort to help other new or develop nation and to strengthen stand for freedom have also make progress a newly unify agency|for|international|development be reorient foreign assistance to emphasize long term development loan instead of grant more economic aid instead of military individual plan to meet the individual need of the nation and new standard on what must do to marshal own resource a newly conceive peace|corps be win friend and help people in country supply train and dedicated young man and woman to give these new nation a hand in build a society and a glimpse of the good that be in country if there be a problem here be that can not supply the spontaneous and mount demand a newly expand food|for|peace|pro- gram be feed the hungry of many land with the abundance of productive farm provide lunch for child in school wage for economic development relief for the victim of flood and famine and a well diet for million whose daily bread be chief concern these program help people and by help people help freedom the view of government may sometimes be very different from our but event in africa the|middle|east and eastern|europe teach never to write off any nation as lose to the communists- that be the lesson of time support the independence of those new or weak state whose history geography economy or lack of power impel to remain outside entangle alliances"--as do for more|than|a|century for the independence of nation be a bar to the communists ' grand design"-it be the basis of own in the|past|year for example have urge a neutral and independent laos regain there a common policy with major ally and insist that a cease fire precede negotiation while a workable formula for supervise independence be still to be achieve both the spread of war which may have involve this country also and a communist occupation have thus far be prevent a satisfactory settlement in laos would also help to achieve and safeguard the peace in viet nam where the foe be increase tactic of terror where own effort have be step up and where the local government have initiate new program and reform to broaden the base of resistance the systematic aggression now bleed that country be not a war of liberation"--for viet nam be already free be a war of attempt subjugation and will be resist finally the united strength of the|atlantic|community have flourish in the|last|year under severe test nato have increase both the number and the readiness of air ground and naval unit both nuclear and non - nuclear capability even great effort by all member be still require nevertheless unity of purpose and will have be believe immeasurably strengthen the threat to the brave city of berlin remain in these|last|6|months the allies have make unmistakably clear that presence in berlin free access thereto and the freedom of two|million|west|berliner would not be surrender either to force or through appeasement and to maintain those right and obligation be prepared to talk when appropriate and to fight if necessary every member of nato stand with in a common commitment to preserve this symbol of free man 's will to remain free can not now predict the course of future negotiation over berlin can only say that be spare no honorable effort to find a peaceful and mutually acceptable resolution of this problem believe such a resolution can be find and with an improvement in relation with the|soviet|union if only the leader in the kremlin will recognize the basic right and interest involve and the interest of all mankind in peace but the|atlantic|community be no longer concerned with purely military aim as common undertaking grow at an ever increase pace be and increasingly will be partner in aid trade defense diplomacy and monetary affair the emergence of the new europe be be match by the emergence of new tie across the atlantic be a matter of undramatic daily cooperation in hundred of workaday task of currency keep in effective relation of development loan mesh together of standardized weapon and concert diplomatic position the|atlantic|community grow not like a volcanic mountain by mighty explosion but like a coral reef from the accumulate activity of all thus in the free world be move steadily toward unity and cooperation in the tooth of that old bolshevik prophecy and at the very time when extraordinary rumble of discord can be hear across the iron curtain be not free society which bear within the seed of inevitable disunity on special problem of great concern to friend and to be proud to give the congress an encouraging report effort to safeguard the dollar be progress in the|11|months|preceding|last|february|1 suffer a net loss of nearly|$2|billion in gold in the|11|month that follow the loss be just|over half a dollar and deficit in basic transaction with the rest of the world trade defense foreign aid and capital exclude volatile short term flow have be reduce from for to about|one third that amount for speculative fever against the dollar be end and confidence in the dollar have be restore do not and could not achieve these gain through import restriction troop withdrawal exchange control dollar devaluation or choke off domestic recovery act not in panic but in perspective but the problem be not yet solve persistently large deficit would endanger economic growth and military and defense commitment abroad goal must be a reasonable equilibrium in balance of payment with the cooperation of the congress business labor and major ally that goal can be reach shall continue to attract foreign tourist and investment to shore to seek increase military purchase here by ally to maximize foreign aid procurement from american firm to urge increase aid from other fortunate nation to the less fortunate to seek tax law which do not favor investment in other industrialized nation or tax haven and to urge coordination of ally fiscal and monetary policy so as to discourage large and disturbing capital movement above all if be to pay for commitment abroad must expand export businessman must be export conscious and export competitive tax policy must spur modernization of plant wage and price gain must be consistent with productivity to hold the line on price export credit and promotion campaign for american industry must continue to expand but the great challenge of all be pose by the growth of the|european|common|market assume the accession of there will arise across the atlantic a trading partner behind a single external tariff similar to with an economy which nearly equal own will in this country adapt thinking to these new prospect and pattern or will wait until event have pass by this be the|year to decide the|reciprocal|trade|act be expire need a new law a wholly new approach a bold new instrument of american trade policy decision could well affect the unity of the west the course of and the economic growth of nation for a generation to come if move decisively factory and farm can increase sale to rich fastest grow market export will increase balance of payment position will improve and will have forge across the atlantic a trading partnership with vast resource for freedom if on the other hand hang back in deference to local economic pressure will find cut off from major ally industry and believe this be most vital industry will move plant and job and capital inside the wall of the common market and job therefore will be lose here in the|united|state if can not otherwise compete for consumer farm surplus balance of trade as all know to europe the common market in farm product be nearly|three|or|four|to|one in favor amount to of the good earner of dollar in balance of payment structure and without entrance to this market without the ability to enter farm surplus will pile up in the|middle|west tobacco in the south and other commodity which have go through western|europe for balance of payment position will worsen consumer will lack a wide choice of good at low price and million of american worker whose job depend on the sale or the transportation or the distribution of export or import or whose job will be endanger by the movement of capital to europe or whose job can be maintain only in an expand economy these million of worker in home state and mine will see real interest sacrifice member of the congress the|united|state do not rise to greatness by wait for other to lead this nation be the world 's foremost manufacturer farmer banker consumer and exporter the common market be move ahead at an economic growth rate twice ours the communist economic offensive be under way the opportunity be ours the initiative be up to and believe that be the time to seize that initiative shall shortly send to the congress a new year trade expansion action far reach in scope but design with great care to make certain that benefit to people far outweigh any risk the bill will permit the gradual elimination of tariff here in the|united|state and in the common market on those item in which together supply of the world 's trade mostly item in which own ability to compete be demonstrate by the fact that sell abroad in these item substantially more than import this step will make possible for major industry to compete with counterpart in western|europe for access to european consumer on other good the bill will permit a gradual reduction of duty up|to|50|percent permit bargaining by major category and provide for appropriate and tested form of assistance to firm and employee adjust to import competition be not neglect the safeguard provide by peril point an escape clause or the|national|security|amendment nor be abandon non - european friend or traditional most favor nation principle on the contrary the bill will provide new encouragement for sale of tropical agricultural product so important to friend in latin|america who have long depend upon the european market who now find face with new challenge which must join with in overcome concessions in this bargaining must of course be reciprocal not unilateral the common market will not fulfill own high promise unless outside tariff wall be low the danger of restriction or timidity in own policy have counterpart for friend in europe for together face a common challenge to enlarge the prosperity of free man everywhere to build in partnership a new trading community in which all free nation may gain from the productive energy of free competitive effort these various element in foreign policy lead as have say to a single goal the goal of a peaceful world of free and independent state this be guide for the present and vision for the future a free community of nation independent but interdependent unite north and south east and west in great family of man outgrow and transcend the hate and fear that rend age will not reach that goal today or tomorrow may not reach in own lifetime but the quest be the great adventure of our|century sometimes chafe at the burden of obligation the complexity of decision the agony of choice but there be no comfort or security for in evasion no solution in abdication no relief in irresponsibility a|year|ago in assume the task of the presidency say that few generation in all history have be grant the role of be the great defender of freedom in hour of maximum danger this be good fortune and welcome now as do a|year|ago for be the fate of this generation of in the congress and of as president to live with a struggle do not start in a world do not make but the pressure of life be not always distribute by choice and while no nation have ever face such a challenge no nation have ever be so ready to seize the burden and the glory of freedom and in this high endeavor may god watch over the|united|states|of|america view

suppose really the only date that most people remember where be be pearl|harbor and the death of president franklin|roosevelt face entirely different challenge on this|pearl|harbor in many way the challenge be more serious and in a sense long reach because do not think that any of have any doubt in those|day that the|united|states would survive and prevail and strength increase now be face to face in a most critical time with challenge all around the world and in the labor movement bear a heavy responsibility occasionally read article by those who say that the labor movement have fall into dark day do not believe that and would be very distressed if be true of the great quality about the|united|state which do not think people realize who be not in the labor movement be what a great asset for freedom the american labor movement represent not only here but all around the world be no accident that communists concentrate attention on the trade union movement know that people the work people be frequently leave out that in many area of the world have no one to speak for and the communists mislead and say that will protect right so many go along but in the|united|state because have have a strong free labor movement the work people of this country have not feel that be leave out and as long as the labor movement be strong and as long as be commit to freedom then think that freedom in this country be strengthen so would hope that every american whether be on side of the bargaining table or the other or whether be in a wholly different sphere of life would recognize that the strength of a free american labor movement be vital to the maintenance of freedom in this country and all around the world and be delighted that there be here today understand nearly|150 trade union leader from nearly|32 country around the world believe and say this as president that of the great asset that this country have be the influence which this labor movement can promote around the world in demonstrate what a free trade union can do hope that will go back from this meeting recognize that in the long run a strong labor movement be essential to the maintenance of democracy in country be no accident that there have not be a strike in the|soviet|union for or or 40|year the communists who in latin|america or africa or asia say that represent the people can not possibly under any rule of reason or debate say that a labor movement be free when be not able to express right not only in relationship to the employer but also to speak out and recognize the limitation of governmental power be not omniscient be not all powerful this be a free society and management and labor and the farmer and the citizen have right do not give right in government and hope that those who go from this hall to latin|america to europe to africa will recognize that believe in freedom and in progress in this country that believe that freedom be not an end in but believe that freedom can bring material abundance and prosperity and want to know that consider this meeting and the house of labor vital to the interest of this country and the cause of freedom in the|coming|days what unite labor what unite this country be far more important than those thing on which may disagree so gentleman and lady be not only leader of union but occupy a .position of responsibility as citizen of the|united|state and therefore feel most appropriate to come here today and talk with first want to express appreciation to for several thing for example appreciate the effort that those of who represent the interest of the man and woman who work at missile plant have make the fact that have give and that the man and woman who work there have live up to the no strike pledge at missile and space site have make an appreciable difference in the progress that be make in these area and the country appreciate the effort be make secondly have for the first time a|presidential|advisory|committee on labor management policy which for once do not break up on the passage of the|wagner|act in but instead meet month by month in an attempt to work out and develop economic policy which will permit this country to go forward under condition of full employment and want to thank for the participation have give that third as say want to thank the labor movement for what be do abroad in strengthen the free labor movement and urge to redouble effort the hope as have say of freedom in these country rest in many part with the labor movement do not want to leave the people of some country a choice between place destiny in the hand of a few who hold in hand most of the property and on the other side the communist movement do not give that choice want to have the instrument of freedom to protect and provide for progress in country and a strong free labor movement can do and hope will concentrate attention in the|next|12|month in that area in and all around the world the fact be that the head of the|congo - adoula who have be a strong figure for freedom come out of the labor movement and that be happen in country after country and this be a great opportunity and responsibility for all of to continue to work together and finally want to take this opportunity to express thank to the aflcio for the support that give in the passage of legislative program in the long session of the congress do not always agree on every tactic may not have achieve every goal but can take some satisfaction in the fact that do make progress toward a minimum wage that do expand the coverage for the first time in that do pass the good housing act since that do finally after presidential veto in the|last|4|years pass a bill provide assistance to those area suffer from chronic unemployment that do pass a long range water pollution bill that do pass increase social|security benefit a lowering of the retirement age in social|security from to for man temporary unemployment compensation and aid to dependent child and be come back in january and be go to start again the gross national product have climb since january from to an|estimated|$540|billion in the|last|quarter and be a pleasure for to say that the november employment figure receive this|morning show not more people than be work in february but have now an all time high for november people work but more importantly unlike the usual seasonal run in november which ordinarily provide for an increase in unemployment of about a half a have now bring the figure for the first time below where be hover down to and be go to have to get low would not claim have achieve full .recovery or the permanently high growth rate of which be capable since the recession of from which only partially recover and go into the recession of too many man and woman have be idle for too long a time and first concern must still be with those unable to get work unemployment compensation must be place on a permanent rational basis of nationwide standard and even more importantly those who be old and retire must be permit under a system of social|security to get assistance and relief from the staggering cost of medical bill the time have come in the next session of the congress to face the fact that eider citizen do need these benefit that need can not be adequately meet in any other way and that every member of the congress should have the opportunity to go on the record up or down on this question and believe when come to the floor as believe must be go to vote up and through before adjourn in july or august now there be area that believe that need to give attention to if the manpower budget be to be balance first must give special attention to the problem of young people dr. conant 's recent book only highlight a fact which all of be familiar with and that be the problem of those who drop out of school before have finish because of hardship in home inadequate motivation or counseling or whatever may be and then drift without be able to find a decent job and this fall particularly heavily upon the young man and woman who be in minority group in addition to that young people will be crowd into the labor market in the|next|10|year this can be a tremendous asset because have many task that require talent but today there be one|million young americans under the|age|of|25 who be out of school and out of work million of other leave school early destine to fall for life into a pattern of be untrained unskille and frequently unemployed be for this reason that have ask the congress to pass a youth employment opportunities act to guide these hand so that can make a life for equally important if young people be to be well train and skilled labor be go to be need in the|next|years and if be to be inspire to finish study the|federal|government must meet responsibility in the field of education be not satisfied if particular community have a good school want to make sure that every child in this country have an adequate opportunity for a good education thomas|jefferson once say if expect a country to be ignorant and free expect what never be and never will be be not enough that own home town have a good school want the|united|state as a country to be among the best educate in the world and believe that must invest in youth secondly need a program of retrain unemployed worker all of who live so close to this problem know what happen when technology change and industry move out and man be leave and have see in own state|of|massachusett where textile worker be unemployed unable to find work even with new electronic plant go up all around want to make sure that worker be able to take advantage of the new job that must inevitably come as technology change in the 's and believe therefore that retrain deserve the attention of this congress in the|coming|days and the third group require attention consist of minority citizen all of know the statistic of those who be first discharge and the last to be rehire too often be among those who be member of minority group want everyone to have a chance regardless of race or color to have an opportunity to make a life for and family to get a decent education so have a fair chance to compete and then be judge on what be in here and not on what be on the outside and the american labor movement have be identify with this cause and know that will be in the future and be make a great effort to make sure that all those who secure federal contract and there be billions|of|dollar spend each|year by the|federal|government will give fair opportunity to all of citizen to participate in that work fourth want to provide opportunity for plant re - investment of the matter which be of concern in maintain economy now be the fact that do not have as much re - investment in plant as do for example in and and want this economy and this rise to be continuous and believe have to give as much incentive as be possible to provide reinvestment in plant which make work and will keep economy move ahead and therefore have suggest a tax credit which be hopeful the american labor movement have not place on list of those matter yet that have not support but will consider this proposal as a method of stimulate the economy so that this recovery do not run out of gas in as the recovery after the recession of run out in fifth to add to arsenal of build in stabilizer so can keep economy move ahead be intention to ask the congress at next session for stand by authority somewhat along the line of the bill introduce by senator clark of pennsylvania to make grant in aid to community for need public work when unemployment begin to mount and economy to slow down sixth and finally must expand job opportunity by stimulate trade abroad know that this be a matter to which the labor movement have give a good deal of attention mr. meany make an outstanding speech on this matter several|weeks|ago and be a matter which be of concern to this administration be sure wonder perhaps why be place so much emphasis on and would like to say why be very briefly the first be this country must maintain a favorable balance of trade or suffer severely from the point of view of national security sell abroad now nearly|$5|billion more than import but unfortunately that 5|billion go abroad in order to maintain the national security requirement of the|united|state spend of that in order to keep troop overseas cost nearly|$700|to|$800|million to keep division in western|germany and to keep troop establishment in france and what be true in france and germany which be outpost of commitment be true in other area so that if be not able to maintain a favorable balance of trade then of course will have to do as the british have have to do which be begin to bring troop back and lie the way open for other action so that this be a matter which involve very greatly security and unless believe that the|united|states should retreat to own hemisphere and forget commitment abroad then can share with concern about what will happen if that balance of trade begin to drop now the problem that face have be intensify by the development of the common market this be good market for manufactured product what be concerned about be that shall be able to keep move trade into those area otherwise what will find be that american capital which can not place good in that market will decide as be do now to build plant in western|europe and then hire western|european worker and suffer and the country suffer and the balance of payment suffer so this be a matter of the great importance to in fact to all americans be for example of the great importance to american farmer sell of agricultural commodity to western|europe bring in of agricultural commodity from western|europe in other word make almost|$2|billion of foreign exchange from that sale of agricultural commodity and yet western|europe have great agricultural resource which be increase and be go to find increasingly difficult unless be able to negotiate from a position of strength with so this matter be important the purpose of this discussion be to increase employment the purpose of this discussion be to strengthen the|united|state and be a matter which deserve most profound attention be go to export good and crop or be go to export capital that be the question that be now face and know that those of who have be concern about this know this to be a major problem last|year invest abroad and take in from investment abroad which sound like be a pretty good exchange but if analyze these figure will see that take in from the underdeveloped world which need capital take in and send out in capital for investment and yet this be the area that need investment while in western|europe send out and take in so that if this trend should continue and more and more western|europe become the object of american investment affect all and affect the people who work with be attempt to repeal those tax privilege which make particularly attractive for american capital to invest in western|europe pass law in the|day of the|marshall|plan when want american capital over there and as the result of that there be provision on the tax book which make good business to go over there now want all to be fair and have state be not put in exchange control which will not but recommend in january the passage of a bill which would lessen the tax privilege of invest in western|europe and which would have give in revenue and in balance of payment the tax privilege or the attraction should be in the underdeveloped world where have be take capital out rather than put in and not in western|europe where the capital be sufficient and which do not serve that great national purpose so this be a matter of concern for all of and be a matter which must consider in the|coming|months the common market be a tremendous market have more people than do rate of growth be twice ours income be about|three fifth of and may some day be equal to this can be a great asset not only to but to a great strength tie western|europe the|united|state and latin|america and japan together as a great area of freedom and think that represent of the most hopeful sign since be place where the free world can be on the offensive and be anxious that the|united|states play proper role to protect the interest of people and to advance the cause of freedom and ask the careful consideration of the american labor movement in this area of the problem which have be to recognize that those who have be affect by import have receive no protection at all for a|number|of|year from the|united|states|government when be a senator in introduce legislation to provide assistance to those industry which be hard hit by import be go to recommend in january a program which hope the congress will pass which will provide a recognition of the national responsibility in the period of transition for those industry and people who may be adversely affect be optimistic about the future of this country this be a great country with an energetic people and believe over the long period the people of country and of the world really want freedom and wish to solve own life and own destiny be hopeful that can be associate with that movement be hopeful that will continue to meet responsibility to people as well as to the country hope that can maintain a viable economy here with full employment be hopeful can be competitive here and around the world be hopeful that management and labor will recognize responsibility to permit to compete that those of who be in the area of wage negotiation will recognize the desirability of maintain as stable price as possible and that the area of productivity and stable price that negotiation will take adequate calculation and account of this need for to maintain a balance of trade in favor in the long run be in the interest of own worker let repeat if can not maintain the balance of trade in favor which now be of and indeed increase then this country be go to face most serious problem in the|last|3|years even though the balance of trade in favor have be have lose in gold and if this trend should go on year after year then the|united|stat as have say would have to make adjustment which would be extremely adverse to the cause of freedom around the world the solution rest with increase export trade with remain competitive with business sell abroad find new market and keep people work at home and around the world and be a fact that the country of the common market who face the problem that now face have have in the|last|4|years full employment and an economic growth twice ours even a country which face staggering economic problem a|decade|ago italy have be steadily build gold balance cut down unemployment and move ahead twice what have over the|last|4|years so what be talk about be an opportunity not a burden this be a chance to move the united|state forward in the 's not only in the economic sphere but also to make a contribution to the cause of freedom and come to miami today and ask help as on other occasion other president of the|united|state stretch back to the time of woodrow|wilson and roosevelt and truman have come to the af of l and the cio and each time this organization have say yes thank view transcript transcript mr. president and gentleman understand that president mckinley and be the only|two president of the|united|state to ever address such an occasion suppose that president mckinley and be the only|two that be regard as fiscally sound enough to be qualified for admission to this organization on an occasion such as this have not always consider the membership of the nam as among strong supporter be not sure have all approach the new frontier with the great possible enthusiasm and be therefore somewhat nervous about accept this invitation until do some studying of the history of this organization learn that this organization have once denounce on occasion i'll quote--"swollen bureaucracy as among the triumph of karl|marx and decry on another occasion new governmental paternalism and socialism be comfort when read this very familiar language to note that be in very good company for the first attack quote be on calvin|coolidge and the second on herbert|hoover remind of this only to indicate the happy failure of many of most pessimistic prediction and that be true of all of recognize that in the last campaign most of the member of this luncheon group today support opponent except for a very few who be under the impression that be father 's son but hope that some of most alarming feeling of a|year|ago about the imminent collapse of the whole business system if be elect have be somewhat lessen have select think able man who hope have come to have a regard for to serve in the responsible position of the government of here distinguished secretary of commerce governor hodges who have a long career in business secretary goldberg who think have earn the respect of business as well as labor secretary of the treasury dillon and under secretary mr. robert|roosa who be the vice president of the|federal|reserve|bank|of|new|york mr. robert|mcnamara whom many of know the secretary of defense mr. john|mccone who be the head of the|central|intelligence|agency succeed mr. dulles and mr. rusk secretary of state think be all man of experience and also think be vitally interested in the maintenance of all kind of freedom in this country think that while may not have be together a|year|ago be together now and will be the president of the|united|state for and be most anxious that while may not agree on all matter that goodwill at least will prevail among and that will both recognize that those of who work in the national government and all of be motivate by a desire to serve country responsibility be different but believe that can have a period in the|next|few|year of cooperation between business and government in order to advance the common interest have read about the feeling of some businessman that be anti - business and would think that a moment 's thought would show how really untrue that must be and say really for reason in the first place be committed to the defense of freedom around the world when business do well in this country have full employment and this country be move ahead then strengthen image as a prosperous and vital country in this great fight in which be engage when do well the|united|state do well and policy abroad do well and when do badly all suffer secondly be unable to maintain the kind of high employment which must maintain unless be make profit and reinvesting and produce and therefore as be commit to the goal and must all be in this country of try to make sure that everyone who want a job will find then quite obviously must make the system work and the business community must prosper and thirdly and to put on most narrow basis be in the national government and know a rather unpopular partner in every of business revenue come from when be make profit then be able to meet bill when fail then fail so for every reason government and business be completely interdependent and completely involve and while may differ on the policy which may bring this country prosperity there be no disagreement be sure on either side about the tremendous importance of gentleman move ahead and prosper and contribute to the growth of this country and hope if nothing else that presence here today indicate that remark represent the view of all of who occupy a position of responsibility in washington today be not an exaggeration to say that this endeavor of build a prosperous america in a world of free and prosperous state of make the most of human and material resource and avoid the harmful effect and fluctuation of inflation and recession be of course matter of the great importance to all and be not an exaggeration to say that this endeavor proceed under condition today more fraught with peril than any in history as communism continue long range drive to impose way of life all around the world strong desire be not unnaturally to seize the initiative to get off the defensive to do more than react to the soviets but while this be not an unreasonable urge concrete application be more difficult in the military arena the initiative rest with the aggressor a role that shun by nature and tradition and alliance be largely therefore defensive in the paramilitary arena of subversion intimidation and insurrection an open and peaceful society be again at a disadvantage but there be area in particular where the initiative can and have be ours an area of strategic importance in which have the capacity for a still great effort and that be in the area of economic policy the marshall plan be an example of initiative in this area so be point|4 and oecd and the|alliance|for|progress this year 's new long range program to aid in the growth of the underdeveloped region of the world and the unaligned nation can bring still further gain not merely as a blow against communism but as a blow for freedom of equal if not great importance be the stunning evolution of western|european economic unity from treaty to concrete reality and be the success of this still grow movement which present the west at this time with an historic opportunity to seize the initiative again the|united|state be in fact require to do so for own self interest and progress the communist bloc largely self contain and isolate represent an economic power already by some standard large than that of western|europe and gain to some degree on the|united|state but the combined output and purchasing power of the|united|state and western|europe be more than twice as great as that of the entire sino soviet bloc though have only|half as much population and far less|than|half as much territory coordinated economic strength will represent a powerful force for the maintenance and growth of freedom but will strength be combine and coordinate or divide and self defeat will work together on problem of trade payment and monetary reserve or will mutual strength be splinter by a network of tariff wall exchange control and the pursuit of narrow self interest in unrelated if not outright hostile policy on aid trade procurement interest rate and currency this be not a debate between deficit nation and surplus nation be not speculation over some grand design for the future be a hard practical question for every member of the western community involve most immediately for this nation policy in mutually dependent area balance of payment and balance of trade while exaggerated fear can be harmful would not inspire need confidence abroad by reign satisfaction with international balance of payment position in essence that position reflect the burden of responsibility as the free world 's leader the chief defender of freedom and the major source of capital investment around the world as the cost of these responsibility grow and be not offset by foreign expenditure here the monetary deficit in relation with the rest of the world grow except to the extent that trade surplus of export over import can increase with during as competition in international market increase in spite of the fact that have a generous balance in favor in trade trade surplus do not keep pace with need at the same time high interest rate in other country as well as speculation in the price of gold attract some american short term capital away from shore balance of payment be in deficit at a rate of nearly|4|billion|dollar a year and with consequence extend by a weaken confidence in the dollar suffer over that period a net loss of 5|billion|dollar in gold reserve the complete elimination of this problem be clearly some time off but so be any ultimately dangerous consequence the|united|state still hold some|43 % of the|free|world 's monetary gold stock a proportion far large than share of trade and clearly sufficient to tide over a temporary deficit period and emphasize the word temporary deficit period while mount an offensive to reverse these trend export and export surplus have both be rise the net claim of americans against foreigner have double during the|last|decade and the annual increase in the value of asset abroad which now total nearly|45|billion|dollar and must always be put in the balance sheet when be consider the movement of gold and dollar in the value of asset abroad have regularly exceed payment deficit contrary to the assertion that this nation have be live beyond mean abroad have be increase those mean instead this|year moreover wholesale price have be steady in fact in spite of the recovery wholesale price be a fraction less than be in february and in a very real sense for the|united|state have have generally stable price confidence in the dollar have be uphold the speculation fever against the dollar have cease the outflow of gold have be reduce from in the|ten|months|before|february|1961 to in the|last|ten|month and due partly to the temporary decline in import that accompany the recession general payment deficit in will be less|than|half of the deficit there be cause for concern in short but do not believe that there be cause for alarm should be blind neither to basic strength nor to basic problem a long term deficit require long term solution and must not be panic by setback of a short run nature or the inevitable result of a revive economy which have increase import and therefore leave in a less favorable position than may have expect two|or|three|months|ago for negative shortsighted remedy will do more to weaken confidence in the dollar than strengthen and this administration therefore during term of office and repeat this and make as a flat statement have no intention of impose exchange control devalue the dollar raise trade barrier or choke off economic recovery what will do and have be do be to take a series of positive step to reduce outpayment and to increase receipt from abroad first of all recognize as already stress that this country can not solve this problem alone ally have a vital interest in solution because let repeat if be not for national security commitment abroad which defend own interest and that of allies the|united|states would have gold pour in rather than pour out be this commitment which be extremely large and constant which give problem and should be so recognize allies therefore have a vital interest in the solution thus have seek to increase the share of the contribution which other industrialize state be make to the less develop world and be seek assumption of a large share of the cost of joint defense requirement lose three|billion|dollars a year because of defense expenditure cost hundreds|of|millions|of|dollar to keep troop in western|germany lose nearly|three|hundred|million|dollar a year to france alone because of defense expenditure in those area that three|billion|dollars therefore represent a charge in the interest of national security which be vitally important that drain be serious and be because of that reason that president eisenhower last|year suggest the exceptional step of bring back dependent from western|europe which would have save two|hundred|and|fifty|million|dollars but three|billion|dollars represent the contribution which make to defense establishment abroad the reason why the british as know have be consider withdraw some of troop from basis station around the world be because of balance of payment difficulty the reason that have be reluctant to station additional troop in western|germany have be because of the same reason in other word therefore the matter which be now discuss of trade involve not only economic wellbeing but the basic commitment of the|united|state to dozen of country around the world unless balance of trade and surplus be sufficient for example to pay for this three|billions|of|dollar then have no remedy but to start pull back so that for those who address to this subject in the|coming|months must realize that go to the heart of survival as well as economic vitality be work with foreign government now and central bank on new technique for deal in foreign currency on coordinate development aid fiscal debt management monetary and other policy through the oecd on prepare a new stand by lending authority for on the prepayment of allies ' long term debt during this period of adverse trend and on increase the proportion of own military procurement in the|united|state a very important move because of the arrangement that have be recently make that be expect to cut payment deficit by at|least|another|half a dollar next|year secondly to hold own outlay abroad to the absolute essential have emphasize procurement in this country for military aid and overseas defense and insist upon for quarter of economic aid this mean that economic aid to these country do not go as far as once do the south|korean can buy fertilizer from japan at half the cost that can buy here in the|united|state and much less shipping but because be determined to protect gold and therefore dollar have impose the buy american policy which mean now that loss because of economic aid abroad general program which amount to about|four|billion|dollar be now down as far as dollar loss to five|hundred|million|dollar and be hopeful that can squeeze even down further have also substitute local currency expenditure for dollar expenditure to cover local cost wherever possible and seek to discourage by a change in the custom law heavy expenditure abroad by tourist to supplement restriction already place on military family will say be alarm to hear the other day of a study in the|defense|department of this question of dependent abroad which indicate that those who have no dependent abroad spend more money abroad than those with dependent so indicate that for every solution there be additional problem third to encourage a great movement of fund in this direction and to discourage transfer in these other direction have set up a new program to attract foreign visitor secure passage of a tax exemption encourage foreign central bank to invest capital in u.s. security keep own short term interest rate high enough to avoid unnecessary outflow and urge ally to free own private capital for investment here at the same time have direct the treasury for the first time in a generation to buy and sell foreign currency in the international exchange market so as to strengthen ability to offset unfavorable development affect the value of the dollar fourth have ask the congress and this be a matter which be controversial and to which this group have take exception have ask the congress to remove the artificial tax preference for american investment in highly develop country with no capital shortage and the unjustifiable tax avoidance loophole available to those americans invest in so call tax haven nation do not seek to penalize those who wish to invest capital abroad be commit to the free flow of capital but also want to make sure that tax law do not encourage the outward movement of capital in a way which do not serve national purpose be aware that many of will argue that the investment abroad of these fund will mean that ultimately and in the long run these money will be come back but how long a run and how long can afford without take every responsible step to try to bring this in balance in the short run can not wait till if be lose two|or|three|billion|dollar a year and be now for the first time down to about|sixteen|billion nine|hundred|million|dollar in gold in the|united|state so that want to emphasize that however unsatisfactory may feel be be not be do to harass business but only because represent additional effort to try to bring the dollar into balance and if can increase trade so that surplus in trade be sufficient to make up these figure then this kind of tax would be unnecessary or if this organization have some other plan or program which do not affect national security which be more equitable will be glad to listen to that but be concerned that while capital move freely the tax policy do not stimulate and emphasize this in say again that do not believe that exchange control base on the experience of the british and other and unique role as the banker of the world would be either workable or helpful but the recent flow of capital to nation already fully develop have be a serious drain in the shortrun on current balance of payment position the eventual return from that capital be no help to today and at a time when be hardpressed to pay for the maintenance of force in europe without unreasonably increase payment deficit and gold outflow be sure must realize that make no sense to be encourage an exodus of capital through tax law that be more appropriate at a time when europe be deficient in capital probably be familiar with these figure in the long term outward flow of capital fund be a seven|hundred|million|dollar the return be two|billion three|hundred|million|dollar and therefore may argue that be get more back than be send out but when those figure be break down see that the outward investment into the develop country such as western|europe be a five|hundred|million|dollar and the return be only|one|billion|dollars a loss therefore in dollar and potentially in gold of a|half|a|billion|dollar to these country while in the underdeveloped country where would like to see american capital be invest take in one|billion three|hundred|million and invest so that would say gentleman that all of the proposal which will have to put forward in the|coming|months and year to try to bring this into balance and will say that be go to reduce without weaken defense expenditure for military purpose from three|billion|dollar to two|billion|dollars do have to use every available mean that have and if this organization have suggestion as to how may be do want to hear the good way of course be by increase export fifth and most important of all be seek to increase export and thus surplus of export over import shall discuss opportunity but be worth while recount now that have embark on a step up campaign of export promotion and trade fair exhibit increase agricultural export and to indicate the kind of problem that be go to have send to western|europe in agricultural export nearly|two|billion|dollars which be of great dollar earner take in in agricultural export from europe only|about|80|million|dollars a balance of trade for of nearly a and yet as the common market begin to get more and more developed with all of these country begin to face surplus problem there be not any doubt that of most important problem in maintain this kind of dollar flow would be to maintain the free flow of agricultural commodity into the common market there be go to be no more difficult task than that and therefore have to recognize that this too may affect balance of payment have broaden the|export import|bank 's loan guarantee system create a new program of export credit insurance and in a variety of way seek to help to keep american price competitive this require if be to avoid the inflation that will price good out of the world market price and wage restraint by both industry and labor and responsible budget policy by the government require if be to offer modern product efficiently produce at a low cost a high rate of investment in new equipment encourage by the full use of exist capacity in a strong recovery by the investment tax credit now pende before the|house|ways|and|means|committee and by the depreciation reform now under study and already put into effect on textile machinery this organization have take a position against tax credit and the reason be that do not feel be sufficient and support a much more general overhaul of depreciation support that too but tax credit will cost a|billion,|800|million in revenue have suggest and know this have be unpopular certain taxis to make up that revenue because quite obviously can not carry out a tax reduction in these critical time without budget problem as difficult as be therefore while would like under ideal condition and have hope for example to have a surplus this|year before additional expenditure for defense in july be very difficult for to send up a broad tax depreciation scheme which may cost three|billion|dollars with the expectation that other tax reduction would be add to at a time when balance budget with the great difficulty so that be not unsympathetic and can think of very few tax change that would be more useful to the country in stimulate employment and keep competitive particularly with western|europe and the only reason have not go further in and the only reason have limit to the proposal which be now before the|house|ways|and|means|committee be because do not have the available revenue to provide for a tax reduction this|year so that be hopeful in make position know to the congress this|year that while will continue to commit yourself to depreciation change and as say have make some progress in textile will also recognize what budgetary problem be and work with in attempt to get the good arrangement can at this time and plan for more satisfactory arrangement in the future in short achieve a healthy equilibrium in international account depend in part upon the cooperation of allies in part upon action by the congress in part upon the self discipline exercise by this administration in executive and budgetary policy and here repeat intention to submit a balanced budget in january)--and in part upon and other member of the business community labor too have responsibility for price stability and shall stress this tomorrow in address the aflcio recognize that effort will be govern in part by the kind of atmosphere the government can help to create that be why intend to submit balanced budget the government must not be demand more from the saving of the country nor drain more from the available supply of credit when the national interest demand a priority for productive creative investment not only to spur growth at home but to make sure that can sell and sell effectively in market abroad but own responsibility be great and there be thing in particular that can do be competitive through low cost and price and well product and productivity be export minded in a very real sense the british use to say export or die be go to meet commitment have get to export and have to increase export and however impressive have be in the past must be well in the future for the security of this country and finally be calm in the sense of refrain from talk which really do not represent the fact and which cause a concern about where be go abroad be hope that when submit balanced budget in january that those who look at fiscal situation from abroad and make judgment will recognize that be in control that be move ahead and that the|united|states be a good bet all of must share in this effort for this in part as have say be a part of the national security and do not want the|united|state pull troop home because be unable to meet problem in other way but can be calm because basic international position be strong this year 's deficit will be low than last year' gold store be large and the outflow be ease be go to make progress next|year in diminish still further will submit a balanced budget be not undergo a damaging inflation can over the|next|few|year offset with the help of allies a dollar as have say of overseas defense outlay reduce with the help of the congress the money which go because of tax advantage cut back still further that portion of foreign aid procurement which be not already spend here and take the other step have mention include an increase in export for which all the additional tool need be well within reach of those tool which urgently need for own well being be a new trade and tariff policy the|reciprocal|trade|agreements|act expire in june|of|next|year must not simply be renew must be replace if the west be to take the initiative in the economic arena if the|united|state be to keep pace with the revolutionary change which be take place throughout the world if export be to retain and expand position in the world market then need a new and bold instrument of american trade policy for the world of trade be no longer the same % of the|free|world 's industrial production may soon be concentrate in great market and an expand european common market own example of states without a trade barrier behind a common external tariff help to inspire the common market support ever since the close of world|war|ii have be throw behind great european unity for recognize long ago that such unity would produce a europe in which the ancient rivalry which result in world war for as well as for could rest in peace a europe in which the strength and the destiny of germany would be inextricably tie with the west and a europe no longer dependent upon but on the contrary strong enough to share in full partnership with the responsibility and initiative of the|free|world now this new house of europe that seek so long under different administration be actually rise and mean vast new change in outlook as well with the accession of and other european nation to the common market will have almost twice as many people as do will cover nation whose economy have be grow twice as fast as our and will represent an area with a purchasing power which some|day will rival own could be should be most reliable and profitable customer consumer demand be grow particularly for the type of good that produce good for american good not previously sell and sometimes not even know in european market today be an historic meeting of need and opportunity at the very time that urgently need to increase export to protect balance of payment and to pay for troop abroad a vast new market be rise across the atlantic if however the|united|state be to enjoy this opportunity must have the mean to persuade the common market to reduce external tariff to a level which permit product to enter on a truly competitive basis that be why a trade policy adequate to deal with a large number of small state be no longer adequate for almost|thirty|years the reciprocal trade agreements act have strengthen foreign trade policy but today the approach and procedure provide for in that act be totally irrelevant to the problem and opportunity that confront vitality be go a fresh approach be essential and the longer postpone replacement the more painful that step will be when finally happen for this be no longer a matter of local economic interest but of high national policy can no longer haggle over item by item reduction with principal trading partner but must adjust trading tool to keep pace with world trading pattern and the eec can not bargain effectively on an item by item basis be propose in short a new american trade initiative which will make possible for the economic potential of these great market to be harness together in a team capable of pull the full weight of common military economic and political aspiration and do not underrate at all the difficulty that will have in develop this initiative be not propose nor be either necessary or desirable that join the common market alter concept of political sovereignty establish a rich man 's trading community abandon traditional most favor nation policy create an atlantic free trade area or impair in any way close economic tie with canada japan and the rest of the|free|world and this of course be a problem of the great importance to also do not want japan leave out of this great market or latin|america which have depend so much on the european market may find now increasingly difficult because of competition from africa to sell in europe which could mean serious trouble for and therefore for in the long run both political as well as economic be not propose nor be either necessary or desirable that in set new policy on import do away altogether with traditional safeguard and institution believe can provide more meaningful concept of injury and relief and far speedy proceeding can use tariff to cushion adjustment instead of use only to shut off competition and the federal government can aid that process of adjustment through a program shall discuss further tomorrow not a welfare program or a permanent subsidy but a means of permit the traditional american force of adaptability and initiative to substitute progress for injury for obviously import will also increase not as much as export but will increase and need those import if other nation be to have the money to buy export and the incentive to lower own tariff barrier because nobody be go to lower barrier unless the|united|state make a bargain with which feel to be in own economic interest need those import to give consumer a wide choice of good at competitive price need those import to give industry and defense establishment the raw material require at price can afford and to keep a healthy pressure on own producer and worker to improve efficiency develop well product and avoid the inflation that could price out of market vital to own prosperity finally let make clear that be not propose a unilateral lowering of trade barrier what be propose be a joint step on both side of the atlantic aim at benefit not only the exporter of the country concern but the economy of all of the country of the|free|world lead by the great common|market of the atlantic trade barrier in all the industrial nation must be bring down surely will be say that the bold vision which produce the eec will fall short if merely transfer european protectionism from the national to the continental level but if can obtain from the congress and successfully use in negotiation sufficient bargaining power to lower common market restriction against good every segment of the american economy will benefit there be relatively few member of the business community who do not or could not transport distribute or process either export or import there be million of american worker whose job depend on the sale of good abroad make industrial sewing machine or truck or aircraft part or chemical or equipment for oil field or mining or construction may produce lubricant or resin may dig coal or plant cotton in fact the average american farmer today depend on foreign market to sell the crop grow on out of plant in wheat cotton rice and tobacco to name but a few example consumer as mention will benefit most of all but if american industry can not increase sale to the common market and increase this nation 's surplus of export over import international payment position and commitment to the defense of freedom will be endanger if american businessman can not increase or even maintain export to the common market will surely step up investment in new american own plant behind those tariff wall so can compete on an equal basis thereby take capital away from as well as job from own shore and worsen still further balance of payment position if american industry can not increase outlet in the common market own expansion will be stifle the growth target of % in the|sixty adopt last|month by the nation of oecd for combine gross national product will not be reach and business community will lack the incentive to lower price and improve technology which great competition would otherwise inspire the industry which would benefit the most from increase trade be most efficient even though in many case pay high wage good can compete with the good of any other nation those who would benefit the least and be unwilling to adjust to competition be stand in the way as the|nam|economic|advisory|committee point out last|year of great growth and a high standard of living be endanger the profit and job of other effort against inflation balance of payment position and in the long run own economic wellbeing because will suffer from competition in the u.s. inevitably if not from abroad for in order to avoid exertion accept paralysis finally let add if can not increase sale abroad will diminish stature in the|free|world economic isolation and political leadership be wholly incompatible the|united|kingdom face with even more serious problem in effort to achieve both high growth and reasonable balance of payment be move with boldness welcome in the prime minister 's word the brisk shower of competition can not do less for if the nation of the west can weld together on these problem a common program of action as extraordinary in economic history as nato be unprecedented in military history the long range communist aim of divide and encircle all be doom to failure in every sense of the word therefore capitalism be on trial as debate these issue for many|year in many land have boast of the virtue of the marketplace under free competitive enterprise of america 's ability to compete and sell of the vitality of system in keep abreast with the time now the world will see whether mean or not whether america will remain the foremost economic power in the world or whether will evacuate the field of power before a shot be fire or go forth to meet new risk and test of ability the hour of decision have arrive can not afford to wait and see what happen while the tide of event sweep over and beyond must use time as a tool not as a couch must carve out own destiny this be what americans have always do and this have every confidence be what will continue to do in each new trial and opportunity that lie ahead view transcript transcript president odegaard member o the regent member of the faculty student lady and gentleman be a great honor on behalf of the people of the|united|state to extend to congratulation on this university which represent of service to this state and country this nation in of the most critical time in the life of country once in the|day after the|revolution|in|the northwest ordinance to which doctor odegaard refer and again during of the|civil|war in the|morrill|act which establish land grant college this nation make a basic commitment to the maintenance of education for the very reason which thomas|jefferson give that if this nation be to remain free could not remain ignorant the basis of self government and freedom require the development of character and self restraint and perseverance and the long view and these be quality which require many|year of training and education so that think this university and other like across the country and graduate have recognize that these school be not maintain by the people of the various states in order to merely give the graduate of these school an economic advantage in the life struggle rather these school be support by people because people realize that this country have need in the past and need today as never before educate man and woman who be commit to the cause of freedom so for what this university have do in the past and what graduate can do now and in the future salute this university be round when the|civil|war be already on and no one could be sure in whether this country would survive but the picture which the student of have of the world and indeed the picture which citizen have of the world be infinitely more complicated and infinitely more dangerous in the world relation of this country have become tangled and complex of former ally have become adversary and have own adversary who be not ally hero be remove from tomb history rewrite — the name of city change overnight increase arm at a heavy cost primarily to make certain that will not have to use must face up to the chance of war if be to maintain the peace must work with certain country lack in freedom in order to strengthen the cause of freedom find some who call neutral who be friend and sympathetic to and other who call neutral who be unremittingly hostile to and as the most powerful defender of freedom on earth find unable to escape the responsibility of freedom and yet unable to exercise without restraint impose by the very freedom seek to protect can not as a free nation compete with adversary in tactic of terror assassination false promise counterfeit mob and crisis can not under the scrutiny of a free press and public tell different story to different audience foreign and domestic friendly and hostile can not abandon the slow process of consult with ally to match the swift expediency of those who merely dictate to satellite can neither abandon nor control the international organization in which now cast less|than|1|percent of the vote in the|general|assembly possess weapon of tremendous power but be least effective in combat the weapon most often use by freedom 's foe subversion infiltration guerrilla warfare civil disorder send arm to other people just as send the ideal of democracy in which believe but can not send the will to use those arm or to abide by those ideal and while believe not only in the force of arm but in the force of right and reason have learn that reason do not always appeal to unreasonable man that be not always true that a soft answer turneth away wrath"—and that right do not always make might in short must face problem which do not lend to easy or quick or permanent solution and must face the fact that the|united|states be neither omnipotent or omniscient that be only|6|percent of the world 's population that can not impose will upon the other percent of mankind that can not right every wrong or reverse each adversity and that therefore there can not be an american solution to every world problem these burden and frustration be accept by most americans with maturity and understanding may long for the|day when war mean charge up san|juan|hill or when isolation be guard by ocean or when the atomic bomb be ours alone or when much of the industrialized world depend upon resource and aid but now know that those|day be go — and that go with be the old policy and the old complacency 's and know too that must make the good of new problem and new opportunity whatever the risk and the cost but there be other who can not bear the burden of a long twilight struggle lack confidence in long run capacity to survive and succeed hate communism yet see communism in the long run perhaps as the wave of the future and want some quick and easy and final and cheap solution — now there be group of these frustrated citizen far apart in view yet very much alike in approach on the hand be those who urge upon what regard to be the pathway of surrender appease enemy compromise commitment purchase peace at any price disavow arm friend obligation if view have prevail the world of free choice would be small today on the other hand be those who urge upon what regard to be the pathway of war equate negotiation with appeasement and substitute rigidity for firmness if view have prevail would be at war today and in place be a curious fact that each of these extreme opposite resemble the other each believe that have only|two choice appeasement or war suicide or surrender humiliation or holocaust to be either red or dead each side see only hard and soft nation hard and soft policy hard and soft man each believe that any departure from own course inevitably lead to the other group believe that any peaceful solution mean appeasement the other believe that any arm build up mean war group regard everyone else as warmonger the other regard everyone else as appeaser neither side admit that path will lead to disaster but neither can tell how or where to draw the line once descend the slippery slope of appeasement or constant intervention in short while both extreme profess to be the true realist of time neither could be more unrealistic while both claim to be do the nation a service could do no great disservice this kind of talk and easy solution to difficult problem if believe could inspire a lack of confidence among people when must all above all else — be unite in recognize the long and difficult day that lie ahead could inspire uncertainty among ally when above all else must be confident in and even more dangerously could if believe inspire doubt among adversary when must above all be convince that will defend vital interest the essential fact that both of these group fail to grasp be that diplomacy and defense be not substitute for another either alone would fail a willingness to resist force unaccompanie by a willingness to talk could provoke belligerence while a willingness to talk unaccompanie by a willingness to resist force could invite disaster but as long as know what comprise vital interest and long range goal have nothing to fear from negotiation at the appropriate time and nothing to gain by refuse to take part in at a time when a single clash could escalate overnight into a holocaust of mushroom cloud a great power do not prove firmness by leave the task of explore the other 's intention to sentry or those without full responsibility nor can ultimate weapon rightfully be employ or the ultimate sacrifice rightfully demand of citizen until every reasonable solution have be explore how many war winston|churchill have write have be avert by patience and persist good will how many war have be precipitate by firebrand if vital interest under duress can be preserve by peaceful mean negotiation will find that out if adversary will accept nothing less than a concession of right negotiation will find that out and if negotiation be to take place this nation can not abdicate to adversary the task of choose the forum and the framework and the time for there be carefully define limit within which any serious negotiation must take place with respect to any future talk on germany and berlin for example can not on the hand confine proposal to a list of concession be willing to make nor can on the other hand advance any proposal which compromise the security of free germans and west|berliner or endanger tie with the west no one should be under the illusion that negotiation for the sake of negotiation always advance the cause of peace if for lack of preparation break up in bitterness the prospect of peace have be endanger if be make a forum for propaganda or a cover for aggression the process of peace have be abuse but be a test of national maturity to accept the fact that negotiation be not a contest spelling victory or defeat may succeed may fail be likely to be successful only if both side reach an agreement which both regard as preferable to the status an agreement in which each side can consider own situation to be improve and this be most difficult to obtain but while shall negotiate freely shall not negotiate freedom answer to the classic question of patrick|henry be still no — life be not so dear and peace be not so precious as to be purchase at the price of chain and slavery and that be answer even though for the first time since the ancient battle between greek city state war entail the threat of total annihilation of everything know of society for to save mankind 's future freedom must face up to any risk that be necessary will always seek peace but will never surrender in short be neither warmonger nor appeaser neither hard nor soft be americans determine to defend the frontier of freedom by an honorable peace if peace be possible but by arm if arm be use against and if be to move forward in that spirit shall need all the calm and thoughtful citizen that this great university can produce all the light can shed all the wisdom can bring to bear be customary both here and around the world to regard life in the|united|state as easy advantage be many but more than any other people on earth bear burden and accept risk unprecedented in size and duration not for alone but for all who wish to be free no other generation of free man in any country have ever face so many and such difficult challenge — not even those who live in the|day when this university be found in this nation be then tear by war this territory have only the simple element of civilization and this city have barely begin to function but a university be of early thought and sum up in the motto that adopt let there be light what more can be say today regard all the dark and tangle problem face than let there be light and to accomplish that illumination the|university|of|washington shall still hold high the torch view transcript transcript general gavan mr. gleason member of the military force veteran fellow americans today be here to celebrate and to honor and to commemorate the dead and the living the young man who in every war since this country begin have give testimony to loyalty to country and own great courage do not believe that any nation in the history of the world have bury soldier farther from native soil than americans or bury closer to the town in which grow up celebrate this veterans day for a|very|few|minutes a|few|second of silence and then this country 's life go on but think most appropriate that recall on this occasion and on every other moment when be face with great responsibility the contribution and the sacrifice which so many man and family have make in order to permit this country to now occupy present position of responsibility and freedom and in order to permit to gather here together bruce|catton after total the casualty which take place in the battle of antietam not so very far from this cemetery when look at statistic which show that in the short space of a|few|minute whole regiment lose of number then write that life perhaps be not the most precious gift of all that man die for the possession of a|few|feet of a corn field or a rocky hill or for almost nothing at all but in a very large sense die that this country may be permit to go on and that may permit to be fulfil the great hope of founder in a world torment by tension and the possibility of conflict meet in a quiet commemoration of an|historic|day of peace in an age that threaten the survival of freedom join together to honor those who make freedom possible the resolution of the congress which first proclaim armistice|day describe november|11,|1918 as the end of the most destructive sanguinary and far reach war in the history of human annal that resolution express the hope that the|first|world|war would be in truth the war to end all war suggest that those man who have die have therefore not give life in vain be a tragic fact that these hope have not be fulfil that war still more destructive and still more sanguinary follow that man 's capacity to devise new way of kill fellow man have far outstrip capacity to live in peace with fellow man some may say therefore that this|day have lose meaning that the shadow of the new and deadly weapon have rob this|day of great value that whatever name now give this|day whatever flag fly or prayer utter be too late to honor those who die before and too soon to promise the live an end to organized death but let not forget that november|11,|1918 signify a beginning as well as an end the purpose of all war say augustine be peace the first world|war produce man 's first great effort in recent time to solve by international cooperation the problem of war that experiment continue in our|present|day still imperfect still short of responsibility but do offer a hope that some|day nation can live in harmony for part shall achieve that peace only with patience and perseverance and courage the patience and perseverance necessary to work with ally of diverse interest but common goal the courage necessary over a long period of time to overcome an adversary skilled in the art of harassment and obstruction there be no way to maintain the frontier of freedom without cost and commitment and risk there be no swift and easy path to peace in generation no man who witness the tragedy of the last war no man who can imagine the unimaginable possibility of the next war can advocate war out of irritability or frustration or impatience but let no nation confuse perseverance and patience with fear of war or unwillingness to meet responsibility can not save by abandon those who be associate with or reject responsibility in the end the only way to maintain the peace be to be prepare in the final extreme to fight for country and to mean as a nation have little capacity for deception can convince friend and foe alike that be in earnest about the defense of freedom only if be in earnest and can assure the world that be this cemetery be first establish 97|years|ago in this hill be first bury man who die in an early war a savage war here in own country today the man in gray be retire from antietam where thousand of comrade have fall between dawn and dusk in one|terrible|day and the man in blue be move towards fredericksburg where thousand would soon lie by a stone wall in heroic and sometimes miserable death be a crucial moment in nation 's history but these memory sad and proud these quiet ground this cemetery and other like all around the world remind with pride of obligation and opportunity on this|veterans|day|of|1961 on this|day of remembrance let pray in the name of those who have fight in this country 's war and most especially who have fight in the|first|world|war and in that there will be no veteran of any further war not because all shall have perish but because all shall have learn to live together in peace and to the dead here in this cemetery say be the race-- be the race immortal whose beam make broad the common light of day though time may dim though death have bar portal these salute which nameless pass away view transcript transcript mr. chancellor governor sanford member of the faculty lady and gentleman be honor today to be admit to the fellowship of this ancient and distinguished university and be pleased to receive in the short space of the honor for which spend over of life but whether the degree be honorary or earn be a proud symbol of this university and this state north|carolina have long be identify with enlightened and progressive leader and people and can think of no more important reason for that reputation than this university which year after year have send educate man and woman who have have a recognition of public responsibility as well as in private interest distinguished president like president graham and gray distinguished leader like the secretary of commerce governor hodges distinguished member of the congressional delegation carry out a tradition which stretch back to the beginning of this school and that be that the graduate of this university be a man of nation as well as a man of time and be hope in a change world when untold possibility lie before north|carolina and indeed the entire south and country that this university will still hew to the old line of the responsibility that graduate owe to the community at large that in time too will be willing to give to the state and country a portion of life and all of knowledge and all of loyalty want to emphasize in the great concentration which now place upon scientist and engineer how much still need the man and woman educate in the liberal tradition willing to take the long look undisturbed by prejudice and slogan of the moment who attempt to make an honest judgment on difficult event this university have a more important function today than ever before and therefore be proud as president of the|united|state and as a graduate of a small land grant college in massachusetts harvard|university to come to this center of education those of who regard profession of political life with some disdain should remember that make possible for to move from be an obscure lieutenant in the|united|states|navy to commander in chief in with very little technical competence but more than that hope that will realize that from the beginning of this country and especially in north|carolina there have be the close link between educate man and woman and politic and government and also to remember that nation 's first great leader be also first great scholar a contemporary describe thomas|jefferson as a gentleman of who could calculate an eclipse survey an estate tie an artery plan an edifice try a cause break a horse dance the minuet and play the violin john|quincy|adams after be summarily dismiss by the|massachusetts|legislature from the|united|state senate for support thomas|jefferson could then become boylston professor of rhetoric and oratory at harvard|university and then become a great secretary of state and senator daniel|webster could stroll down the corridor of the congress a few step after make some of the great speech in the history of this country and dominate the|supreme|court as the foremost lawyer of this versatility this vitality this intellectual energy put to the service of country represent great resource in these|difficult|days would urge therefore regardless of specialty and regardless of choose field or occupation and regardless of whether bear office or not that recognize the contribution which can make as educate man and woman to intellectual and political leadership in these|difficult|days when the problem be infinitely more complicated and come with increase speed with increase significance in life than be a|century|ago when so many gifted man dominate political life the|united|states|senate have more able man serve in from the period of to than probably any time in history and yet deal with three|or|four problem which have deal with for over a generation now come day by day from all part of the world even the expert find confused and therefore in a free society such as this where the people must make an educated judgment depend upon those of who have have the advantage of the scholar 's education ask to give to the service of country the critical faculty which society have help develop in here ask to decide as goethe put whether will be an anvil or a hammer whether will give the|united|state in which be rear and educate the broad possible benefit of that education be not enough to lend talent to deplore present solution most educated man and woman on occasion prefer to discuss what be wrong rather than to suggest alternative course of action but would have count a friend of ancient greece as george|william|curtis ask a body of educator a|century|ago would have count a friend of ancient greece who quietly discuss the theory of patriotism on that hot summer|day through whose hopeless and immortal hour leonidas and the three|hundred stand at thermopylae for liberty be john|milton to conjugate greek verb in library when the liberty of englishmen be imperil this be a great institution with a great tradition and with devoted alumnus and with the support of the people of this state establishment and continue functioning like that of all great university have require great sacrifice by the people of north|carolina can not believe that all of this be undertake merely to give this school 's graduate an economic advantage in the lifestruggle a university say professor woodrow|wilson should be an organ of memory for the state for the transmission of good tradition and prince|bismarck be even more specific one|third of the student of german university once say break down from over work another third break down from dissipation and the other third rule germany leave to each of to decide in which category will fall do not suggest that political and public life should be turn over to college train expert nor would give this university a seat in the congress as william and mary be once represent in the|virginia|house|of|burgess nor would adopt from the belgian constitution a provision give vote instead of to college graduate at least not until more democrats go to college but do hope that join this university produce train man and woman and what this country need be those who look as the motto of state say at thing as be and not at thing as seem to be for this meeting be hold at an extraordinary time angola and algeria brazil and bizerte syria and south|viet nam korea or kuwait the|dominican|republic berlin the|united|nation all problem which 20|years|ago could not even dream of task in this country be to do good to serve nation 's interest as see and not to be sway from course by the faint hearted or the unknowing or the threat of those who would make foe this be not a simple task in a democracy can not open all book in advance to an adversary who operate in the|night the decision make the weapon possess the bargain will accept nor can always see reflect overnight the success or failure of the action that may take in time past a simple slogan describe policy fifty or fight to make the world safe for democracy no entangling alliance but the time issue and the weapon all have change and complicate and endanger life be a dangerous illusion to believe that the policy of the|united|state stretch as do world wide under vary and different condition can be encompass in slogan or adjective hard or soft or otherwise or to believe that shall soon meet total victory or total defeat peace and freedom do not come cheap and be destine all of here today to live out most if not all of life in uncertainty and challenge and peril policy must therefore blend whatever degree of firmness and flexibility which be necessary to protect vital interest by peaceful mean if possible by resolute action if necessary there be of course no place in america where reason and firmness be more clearly point out than here in north|carolina all americans can profit from what happen in this state a|century|ago be this state firmly fix in the tradition of the south which seek a way of reason in a troubled and dangerous world yet when the|war come north|carolina provide a fourth of all of the confederate soldier who make the supreme sacrifice in those|years and win the right to the slogan first at bethel farth to the front at gettysburg and chickamauga last at appomattox quest for a peaceful resolution of problem be never identify in the mind of people of people today with anything but a desire for peace and a preparation to meet responsibility move for the first time in history through an age in which oppose power have the capacity to destroy each other and while do not intend to see the free world give up shall make every effort to prevent the world from be blow up the american eagle on official seal emphasize both peace and freedom and as say in in this country give equal attention to claws when in left hand hold the arrow and in right the olive branch this be a time of national maturity understanding and willingness to face issue as be not as would like to be be a test of ability to be far see and calm as well as resolute to keep an eye on both danger and opportunity and not to be divert by momentary gain or setback or pressure and be the long view of the educate citizen to which the graduate of this university can best contribute must distinguish the real from the illusory the long range from the temporary the significant from the petty but if can be purposeful if can face up to risk and live up to word if can do duty undeterred by fanatic or frenzy at home or abroad then surely peace and freedom can prevail shall be neither red nor dead but alive and free and worthy of the tradition and responsibility of north|carolina and view transcript transcript mr. president honor delegate lady and gentleman meet in an|hour of grief and challenge dag|hammarskjold be dead but the|united|nation live tragedy be deep in heart but the task for which die be at the top of agenda a noble servant of peace be go but the quest for peace lie before the problem be not the death of man the problem be the life of this organization will either grow to meet the challenge of age or will be go with the wind without influence without force without respect be to let die to enfeeble vigor to cripple power would condemn future for in the development of this organization rest the only true alternative to war and war appeal no longer as a rational alternative unconditional war can no longer lead to unconditional victory can no longer serve to settle dispute can no longer concern the great power alone for a nuclear disaster spread by wind and water and fear could well engulf the great and the small the rich and the poor the commit and the uncommitted alike mankind must put an end to war or war will put an end to mankind so let here resolve that dag|hammarskjold do not live or die in vain let call a truce to terror let invoke the blessing of peace and as build an international capacity to keep peace let join in dismantle the national capacity to wage war this will require new strength and new role for the|united|nation for disarmament without check be but a shadow and a community without law be but a shell already the|united|nation have become both the measure and the vehicle of man 's most generous impulse already have provide in the|middle|east in asia in africa this|year in the congo a means of hold man 's violence within bound but the great question which confront this body in be still before whether man 's cherish hope for progress and peace be to be destroy by terror and disruption whether the foul wind of war can be tame in time to free the cool wind of reason and whether the pledge of charter be to be fulfil or defy pledge to secure peace progress human right and world law in this hall there be not force but be compose of those who be try to build the kind of world describe in articles i and ii of the charter the other seek a far different world would undermine this organization in the process today of all day dedication to the charter must be maintain must be strengthen first of all by the selection of an outstanding civil servant to carry forward the responsibility of the secretary general a man endow with both the wisdom and the power to make meaningful the moral force of the world community the late secretary general nurture and sharpen the|united|nation ' obligation to act but do not invent be there in the charter be still there in the charter however difficult may be to fill mr. hammarskjold 's place can better be fill by man rather than by even the horse of the troika do not have driver all go in different direction have only|one and so must the united|nation executive to install a triumvirate or any panel or any rotate authority in the united|nation administrative office would replace order with anarchy action with paralysis confidence with confusion the secretary general in a very real sense be the servant of the|general|assembly diminish authority and diminish the authority of the only body where all nation regardless of power be equal and sovereign until all the powerful be just the weak will be secure only in the strength of this assembly effective and independent executive action be not the same question as balanced representation in view of the enormous change in membership in this body since founding the american delegation will join in any effort for the prompt review and revision of the composition of united|nation body but to give this organization driver to permit each great power to decide own case would entrench in the headquarters of peace whatever advantage such a plan may hold out to own country as of the great power reject for far prefer world law in the age of self determination to world war in the age of mass extermination today every inhabitant of this planet must contemplate the|day when this planet may no longer be habitable every man woman and child live under a nuclear sword of damocles hang by the slender of thread capable of be cut at any moment by accident or miscalculation or by madness the weapon of war must be abolish before abolish man no longer debate whether armament be a symptom or a cause of tension the mere existence of modern weapon ten|million time more powerful than any that the world have ever see and only|minute away from any target on earth be a source of horror and discord and distrust man no longer maintain that disarmament must await the settlement of all dispute for disarmament must be a part of any permanent settlement and man may no longer pretend that the quest for disarmament be a sign of weakness for in a spiral arm race a nation 's security may well be shrink even as arm increase for this organization have seek the reduction and destruction of arm now that goal be no longer a dream be a practical matter of life or death the risk inherent in disarmament pale in comparison to the risk inherent in an unlimited arm race be in this spirit that the recent belgrade|conference recognize that this be no longer a soviet problem or an american problem but a human problem endorse a program of general complete and strictly an internationally control disarmament be in this same spirit that in the|united|state have labor this|year with a new urgency and with a new now statutory agency fully endorse by the congress to find an approach to disarmament which would be so far reach yet realistic so mutually balanced and beneficial that could be accept by every nation and be in this spirit that have present with the agreement of the|soviet|union under the label both nation now accept of general and complete disarmament"--a new statement of newly agree principle for negotiation but be well aware that all issue of principle be not settle and that principle alone be not enough be therefore intention to challenge the|soviet|union not to an arm race but to a peace race to advance together step by step stage by stage until general and complete disarmament have be achieve invite now to go beyond agreement in principle to reach agreement on actual plan the program to be present to this assembly for general and complete disarmament under effective international control move to bridge the gap between those who insist on a gradual approach and those who talk only of the final and total achievement would create machinery to keep the peace as destroy the machinery of war would proceed through balanced and safeguarded stage design to give no state a military advantage over another would place the final responsibility for verification and control where belong not with the big power alone not with one 's adversary or one 's self but in an international organization within the framework of the|united|nation would assure that indispensable condition of disarmament true inspection and apply in stage proportionate to the stage of disarmament would cover delivery system as well as weapon would ultimately halt production as well as testing transfer as well as possession would achieve under the eye of an international disarmament organization a steady reduction in force both nuclear and conventional until have abolish all army and all weapon except those need for internal order and a new and start that process now today even as the talk begin in short general and complete disarmament must no longer be a slogan use to resist the first step be no long to be a goal without mean of achieve without mean of verify progress without mean of keep the peace be now a realistic plan and a test a test of those only willing to talk and a test of those willing to act such a plan would not bring a world free from conflict and greed but would bring a world free from the terror of mass destruction would not usher in the era of the super state but would usher in an era in which no state could annihilate or be annihilate by another in this nation propose the|baruch|plan to internationalize the atom before other nation even possess the bomb or demilitarize troop propose with ally the|disarmament|plan of while still at war in korea and make proposal today while build up defense over berlin not because be inconsistent or insincere or intimidate but because know the right of free man will prevail because while be compel against will to rearm look confidently beyond berlin to the kind of disarm world all prefer therefore propose on the basis of this plan that disarmament negotiation resume promptly and continue without interruption until an entire program for general and complete disarmament have not only be agree but have be actually achieve the logical place to begin be a treaty assure the end of nuclear test of all kind in every environment under workable control the|united|state and have propose such a treaty that be both reasonable effective and ready for signature be still prepared to sign that treaty today also propose a mutual ban on atmospheric testing without inspection or control in order to save the human race from the poison of radioactive fallout regret that that offer have not be accept for have seek to make the atom an instrument of peaceful growth rather than of war but for concession have be match by obstruction patience by intransigence and the plea of mankind for peace have meet with disregard finally as the explosion of other becloud the sky country be leave with no alternative but to act in the interest of own and the free world 's security can not endanger that security by refrain from testing while other improve arsenal nor can endanger by another long un - inspected ban on testing for three|year accept those risk in open society while seek agreement on inspection but this|year while be negotiate in good faith in geneva other be secretly prepare new experiment in destruction test be not pollute the atmosphere deterrent weapon be guard against accidental explosion or use doctor and scientist stand ready to help any nation measure and meet the hazard to health which inevitably result from the test in the atmosphere but to halt the spread of these terrible weapon to halt the contamination of the air to halt the spiral nuclear arm race remain ready to seek new avenue of agreement new disarmament|program thus include the follow proposal sign the test ban treaty by all nation this can be do now test ban negotiation need not and should not await general disarmament stop the production of fissionable material for use in weapon and prevent transfer to any nation now lack in nuclear weapon prohibit the transfer of control over nuclear weapon to state that do not own keep nuclear weapon from seed new battleground in outer space gradually destroy exist nuclear weapon and convert material to peaceful us and --finally halt the unlimited testing and production of strategic nuclear delivery vehicle and gradually destroy as well to destroy arm however be not enough must create even as destroy create worldwide law and law enforcement as outlaw worldwide war and weapon in the world seek the|united|nations|emergency|force which have be hastily assemble uncertainly supply and inadequately finance will never be enough therefore the|united|states recommend the president that all member nation earmark special peace keep unit in armed force to be on call of the|united|nation to be specially train and quickly available and with advance provision for financial and logistic support in addition the american delegation will suggest a series of step to improve the|united|nation ' machinery for the peaceful settlement of dispute for on the spot fact find mediation and adjudication for extend the rule of international law for peace be not solely a matter of military or technical problem be primarily a problem of politic and people and unless man can match stride in weaponry and technology with equal stride in social and political development great strength like that of the dinosaur will become incapable of proper control and like the dinosaur vanish from the earth as extend the rule of law on earth so must also extend to man 's new domain outer space all of salute the brave cosmonaut of the|soviet|union the new horizon of outer space must not be drive by the old bitter concept of imperialism and sovereign claim the cold reach of the universe must not become the new arena of an even cold war to this end shall urge proposal extend the|united|nations|charter to the limit of man 's exploration in the universe reserve outer space for peaceful use prohibit weapon of mass destruction in space or on celestial body and open the mystery and benefit of space to every nation shall propose further cooperative effort between all nation in weather prediction and eventually in weather control shall propose finally a global system of communication satellite link the whole world in telegraph and telephone and radio and television the|day nee not be fat away when such a system will televise the proceeding of this body to every corner of the world for the benefit of peace but the mystery of outer space must not divert eye or energy from the harsh reality that face fellow man political sovereignty be but a mockery without the mean of meeting poverty and literacy and disease self determination be but a slogan if the future hold no hope that be why nation which have freely share capital and technology to help other help now propose officially designate this|decade of the 's as the|united|nations|decade|of|development under the framework of that resolution the|united|nation ' exist effort in promote economic growth can be expand and coordinate regional survey and training institute can now pool the talent of many new research technical assistance and pilot project can unlock the wealth of less developed land and untapped water and development can become a cooperative and not a competitive enterprise to enable all nation however diverse in system and belief to become in fact as well as in law free and equal nation country favor a world of free and equal state agree with those who say that colonialism be a key issue in this assembly but let the full fact of that issue be discuss in full on the hand be the fact that since the close of world|war|ii a worldwide declaration of independence have transform people and into free and independent state less|than|2|percent of the world 's population now live in dependent territory do not ignore the remain problem of traditional colonialism which still confront this body those problem will be solve with patience good will and determination within the limit of responsibility in such matter country intend to be a participant and not merely an observer in the peaceful expeditious movement of nation from the status of colony to the partnership of equal that continue tide of self determination which run so strong have sympathy and support but colonialism in harsh form be not only the exploitation of new nation by old of dark skin by light or the subjugation of the poor by the rich nation be once a colony and know what colonialism mean the exploitation and subjugation of the weak by the powerful of the many by the few of the govern who have give no consent to be govern whatever continent class or color and that be why there be no ignore the fact that the tide of self determination have not reach the communist empire where a population far large than that officially term dependent life under government instal by foreign troop instead of free institution under a system which know only|one party and belief which suppress free debate and free election and free newspaper and free book and free trade union and which build a wall to keep truth a stranger and own citizen prisoner let debate colonialism in full and apply the principle of free choice and the practice of free plebiscite in every corner of the globe finally as president of the|united|state consider duty to report to this assembly on threat to the peace which be not on crowded agenda but which cause and most of the deep concern the first threat on which wish to report be widely misunderstood the smolder coal of war in southeast|asia south|viet nam be already under attack sometimes by a single assassin sometimes by a band of guerrilla recently by full battalion the peaceful border of burma cambodia and india have be repeatedly violate and the peaceful people of laos be in danger of lose the independence gain not so long ago no one can call these war of liberation for these be free country live under own government nor be these aggression any less real because man be knife in home and not shoot in the field of battle the very simple question confront the world community be whether measure can be devise to protect the small and the weak from such tactic for if be successful in laos and south|viet nam the gate will be open wide the|united|states seek for no base no territory no special position in this area of any kind support a truly neutral and independent laos people free from outside interference live at peace with and with neighbor assure that territory will not be use for attack on other and under a government comparable as mr. khrushchev and agree at vienna to cambodia and burma but now the negotiation over laos be reach a crucial stage the cease fire be at good precarious the rainy season be come to an end laotian territory be be use to infiltrate south|viet nam the world community must recognize and all those who be involve that this potent threat to laotian peace and freedom be indivisible from all other threat to own secondly wish to report to on the crisis over germany and berlin this be not the time or the place for immoderate tone but the world community be entitle to know the very simple issue as see if there be a crisis be because an exist peace be under threat because an exist island of free people be under pressure because solemn agreement be be treat with indifference establish international right be be threaten with unilateral usurpation peaceful circulation have be interrupt by barbed wire and concrete block one recall the order of the czar in pushkin 's boris godunov take step at this|very|hour that frontier be fence in by barrier that not a single soul pass o'er the border that not a hare be able to run or a crow to fly be absurd to allege that be threaten a war merely to prevent the|soviet|union and east|germany from sign a so call treaty of peace the|western|allie be not concerned with any paper arrangement the soviets may wish to make with a regime of own creation on territory occupy by own troop and govern by own agent no such action can affect either right or responsibility if there be a dangerous crisis in berlin and there be be because of threat against the vital interest and the deep commitment of the|western|power and the freedom of west|berlin can not yield these interest can not fail these commitment can not surrender the freedom of these people for whom be responsible a peace treaty which carry with the provision which destroy the peace would be a fraud a free city which be not genuinely free would suffocate freedom and would be an infamy for a city or a people to be truly free must have the secure right without economic political or police pressure to make own choice and to live own life and as have say before if anyone doubt the extent to which presence be desire by the people of west|berlin be ready to have that question submit to a free vote in all berlin and if possible among all the german people the elementary fact about this crisis be that be unnecessary the elementary tool for a peaceful settlement be to be find in the charter under law agreement be to be keep unless change by all those who make establish right be to be respect the political disposition of people should rest upon own wish freely express in plebiscite or free election if there be legal problem can be solve by legal mean if there be a threat of force must be reject if there be desire for change must be a subject for negotiation and if there be negotiation must be root in mutual respect and concern for the right of other the western powers have calmly resolve to defend by whatever mean be force upon obligation and access to the free citizen of west|berlin and the self determination of those citizen this generation learn from bitter experience that either brandish or yield to threat can only lead to war but firmness and reason can lead to the kind of peaceful solution in which country profoundly believe be committed to no rigid formula see no perfect solution recognize that troop and tank can for a time keep a nation divide against will however unwise that policy may seem to but believe a peaceful agreement be possible which protect the freedom of west|berlin and ally presence and access while recognize the historic and legitimate interest of other in assure european security the possibility of negotiation be now be explore be too early to report what the prospect may be for part would be glad to report at the appropriate time that a solution have be find for there be no need for a crisis over berlin threaten the peace and if those who create this crisis desire peace there will be peace and freedom in berlin the event and decision of the|next|ten|month may well decide the fate of man for the|next|ten|thousand|years there will be no avoid those event there will be no appeal from these decision and in this hall shall be remember either as part of the generation that turn this planet into a flame funeral pyre or the generation that meet vow to save succeed generation from the scourge of war in the endeavor to meet that vow pledge every effort this nation possess pledge that shall neither commit nor provoke aggression that shall neither flee nor invoke the threat of force that shall never negotiate out of fear shall never fear to negotiate terror be not a new weapon throughout history have be use by those who could not prevail either by persuasion or example but inevitably fail either because man be not afraid to die for a life worth live or because the terrorist come to realize that free man can not be frighten by threat and that aggression would meet own response and be in the light of that history that every nation today should know be friend or foe that the|united|states have both the will and the weapon to join free man in stand up to responsibility but come here today to look across this world of threat to a world of peace in that search can not expect any final triumph for new problem will always arise can not expect that all nation will adopt like system for conformity be the jailer of freedom and the enemy of growth nor can expect to reach goal by contrivance by fiat or even by the wish of all but however close sometimes seem to that dark and final abyss let no man of peace and freedom despair for do not stand alone if all can persevere if can in every land and office look beyond own shore and ambition then surely the age will dawn in which the strong be just and the weak secure and the peace preserve lady and gentleman of this assembly the decision be ours never have the nation of the world have so much to lose or so much to gain together shall save planet or together shall perish in flame save can and save must and then shall earn the eternal thank of mankind and as peacemaker the eternal blessing of god.&nbsp & nbsp & nbsp view transcript transcript good evening seven|weeks|ago tonight return from europe to report on meeting with premier|khrushchev and the other grim warning about the future of the world aide memoire on berlin subsequent speech and threat which and agent have launch and the increase in the soviet military budget that have announce have all prompt a series of decision by the administration and a series of consultation with the member of the nato organization in berlin as recall intend to bring to an end through a stroke of the pen first legal right to be in west|berlin and secondly ability to make good on commitment to the two|million free people of that city that can not permit be clear about what must be do and intend to do want to talk frankly with tonight about the first step that shall take these action will require sacrifice on the part of many of citizen more will be require in the future will require from all of courage and perseverance in the|year to come but if and ally act out of strength and unity of purpose with calm determination and steady nerve use restraint in word as well as weapon be hopeful that both peace and freedom will be sustain the immediate threat to free man be in west|berlin but that isolated outpost be not an isolated problem the threat be worldwide effort must be equally wide and strong and not be obsess by any single manufactured crisis face a challenge in berlin but there be also a challenge in southeast|asia where the border be less guard the enemy harder to find and the danger of communism less apparent to those who have so little face a challenge in own hemisphere and indeed wherever else the freedom of human being be at stake let remind that the fortune of war and diplomacy leave the free people of west|berlin in behind the iron curtain this map make very dear the problem that face the white be west|germany the east be the area control by the|soviet|union and as can see from the chart west|berlin be within the area which the soviets now dominate which be immediately control by the so call east|german regime be there as a result of victory over nazi germany and basic right to be there derive from that victory include both presence in west|berlin and the enjoyment of access across east|germany these right have be repeatedly confirm and recognize in special agreement with the|soviet|union berlin be not a part of east|germany but a separate territory under the control of the ally power thus right there be clear and deep rooted but in addition to those right be commitment to sustain and defend if need be the opportunity for more|than|two|million people to determine own future and choose own way of life thus presence in west|berlin and access thereto can not be end by any act of the soviet government the nato shield be long ago extend to cover west|berlin and have give word that an attack upon that city will be regard as an attack upon all for west|berlin lie expose inside east|germany surround by soviet troop and close to soviet supply line have many role be more than a showcase of liberty a symbol an island of freedom in a communist sea be even more than a link with the|free|world a beacon of hope behind the iron curtain an escape hatch for refugee west|berlin be all of that but above all have now become as never before the great testing place of western courage and will a focal point where solemn commitment stretch back over the|years|since|1945 and soviet ambition now meet in basic confrontation would be a mistake for other to look upon berlin because of location as a tempting target the|united|state be there and france be there the pledge of nato be there and the people of berlin be there be as secure in that sense as the rest of for can not separate safety from own hear say that west|berlin be militarily untenable and so be bastogne and so in fact be stalingrad any dangerous spot be tenable if man brave man will make so do not want to fight but have fight before and other in early time have make the same dangerous mistake of assume that the west be too selfish and too soft and too divide to resist invasion of freedom in other land those who threaten to unleash the force of war on a dispute over west|berlin should recall the word of the ancient philosopher a man who cause fear can not be free from fear can not and will not permit the communists to drive out of berlin either gradually or by force for the fulfillment of pledge to that city be essential to the morale and security of western|germany to the unity of western|europe and to the faith of the entire free|world soviet strategy have long be aim not merely at berlin but at divide and neutralize all of europe force back on own shore must meet oft state pledge to the free people of west|berlin and maintain right and safety even in the face of force in order to maintain the confidence of other free people in word and resolve the strength of the alliance on which security depend be dependent in turn on willingness to meet commitment to so long as the communists insist that be prepare to end by unilaterally right in west|berlin and commitment to people must be prepared to defend those right and those commitment will at all time be ready to talk if talk will help but must also be ready to resist with force if force be use upon either alone would fail together can serve the cause of freedom and peace the new preparation that shall make to defend the peace be part of the long term build up in strength which have be underway since january be base on need to meet a world wide threat on a basis which stretch far beyond the present berlin crisis primary purpose be neither propaganda nor provocation but preparation a first need be to hasten progress toward the military goal which the north|atlantic ally have set for in europe today nothing less will suffice will put even great resource into fulfil those goal and look to ally to do the same the supplementary defense build up that ask from the congress in march and may have already start move toward these and other defense goal include an increase in the size of the|marine|corps improved readiness of reserve expansion of air and sea lift and step up procurement of need weapon ammunition and other item to insure a continue invulnerable capacity to deter or destroy any aggressor provide for the strengthening of missile power and for put % of b-52 and b-47 bomber on a ground alert which would send on way with warning these measure must be speed up and still other must now be take must have sea and air lift capable of move force quickly and in large number to any part of the world but even more importantly need the capability of place in any critical area at the appropriate time a force which combine with those of ally be large enough to make clear determination and ability to defend right at all cost and to meet all level of aggressor pressure with whatever level of force be require intend to have a wide choice than humiliation or all out nuclear action while be unwise at this time either to call up or send abroad excessive number of these troop before be need let make clear that intend to take as time go on whatever step be necessary to make certain that such force can be deploy at the appropriate time without lessen ability to meet commitment elsewhere thus in the|day and month ahead shall not hesitate to ask the congress for additional measure or exercise any of the executive power that possess to meet this threat to peace everything essential to the security of freedom must be do and if that should require more man or more taxis or more control or other new power shall not hesitate to ask the measure propose today will be constantly study and alter as necessary but while will not let panic shape policy neither will permit timidity to direct program accordingly be now take the following step be tomorrow request the congress for the|current|fiscal|year an additional of appropriation for the|armed|force to fill out present army|division and to make more man available for prompt deployment be request an increase in the army 's total authorized strength from to approximately|1|million man be request an increase of and man respectively in the active duty strength of the navy and the|air|force to fulfill these manpower need be order that draft call be double and triple in the|coming|months be ask the congress for authority to order to active duty certain ready reserve unit and individual reservist and to extend tour of duty;2 and under that authority be plan to order to active duty a number of air transport squadron and air|national|guard tactical air squadron to give the airlift capacity and protection that need other reserve force will be call up when need many ship and plane once head for retirement be to be retain or reactivate increase airpower tactically and sealift airlift and anti - submarine warfare capability in addition strategic air power will be increase by delay the deactivation of b-47 bomber finally some|$1.8|billion of the total sum be need for the procurement of non - nuclear weapon ammunition and equipment the detail on all these request will be present to the congress tomorrow subsequent step will be take to suit subsequent need comparable effort for the common defense be be discuss with nato ally for commitment and interest be as precise as own and let add that be well aware of the fact that many american family will bear the burden of these request study or career will be interrupt husband and son will be call away income in some case will be reduce but these be burden which must be bear if freedom be to be defend americans have willingly bear before and will not flinch from the task now have another sober responsibility to recognize the possibility of nuclear war in the missile age without citizen know what should do and where should go if bomb begin to fall would be a failure of responsibility in may pledge a new start on civil defense last|week assign on the recommendation of the civil defense director basic responsibility for this program to the secretary of defense to make certain be administer and coordinate with continental defense effort at the high civilian level tomorrow be request of the congress new fund for the follow immediate objective to identify and mark space in exist structure public and private that could be use for fall out shelter in case of attack to stock those shelter with food water first aid kit and other minimum essential for survival to increase capacity to improve air raid warning and fall out detection system include a new household warning system which be now under development and to take other measure that will be effective at an|early|date to save million of life if need in the event of an attack the life of those family which be not hit in a nuclear blast and fire can still be save if can be warn to take shelter and if that shelter be available owe that kind of insurance to family and to country in contrast to friend in europe the need for this kind of protection be new to shore but the time to start be now in the|coming|months hope to let every citizen know what step can take without delay to protect family in case of attack know that will want to do no less the addition of in civil|defense appropriation bring total new defense budget request to and a total of for the|year this be an increase in the defense budget of since january and have result in official estimate of a budget deficit of over|$5|billion the secretary of the treasury and other economic adviser assure however that economy have the capacity to bear this new request be recover strongly from this year 's recession the increase in this|last|quarter|of|our|year of total national output be great than that for any postwar period of initial recovery and yet wholesale price be actually low than be during the recession and consumer price be only|1/4 of % high than be last|october in fact this|last|quarter be the first in eight|year in which production have increase without an increase in the overall price index and for the first time since the|fall|of|1959 gold position have improve and the dollar be more respected abroad these gain should be stress be be accomplish with budget deficit far small than those of the recession this improve business outlook mean improve revenue and intend to submit to the congress in january a budget for the|next|fiscal|year which will be strictly in balance nevertheless should an increase in taxis be need because of event in the|next|few|month to achieve that balance or because of subsequent defense rise those increase taxis will be request in january meanwhile to help make certain that the current deficit be hold to a safe level must keep down all expenditure not thoroughly justify in budget request the luxury of current post - office deficit must be end cost in military procurement will be closely scrutinize and in this effort welcome the cooperation of the congress the tax loophole have specify on expense account overseas income dividend interest coo operative and other must be close realize that no public revenue measure be welcome by everyone but be certain that every american want to pay fair share and not leave the burden of defend freedom entirely to those who bear arm for have mortgage very future on this defense and can not fail to meet responsibility but must emphasize again that the choice be not merely between resistance and retreat between atomic holocaust and surrender peace time military posture be traditionally defensive but diplomatic posture nee not be response to the berlin crisis will not be merely military or negative will be more than merely stand firm for do not intend to leave to other to choose and monopolize the forum and the framework of discussion do not intend to abandon duty to mankind to seek a peaceful solution as signer of the|un|charter shall always be prepared to discuss international problem with any and all nation that be willing to talk and listen with reason if have proposal not demand shall hear if seek genuine understanding not concession of right shall meet with have previously indicate readiness to remove any actual irritant in west|berlin but the freedom of that city be not negotiable can not negotiate with those who say what be mine be and what be your be negotiable but be willing to consider any arrangement or treaty in germany consistent with the maintenance of peace and freedom and with the legitimate security interest of all nation recognize the|soviet|union 's historical concern about security in central|and after a series of ravage invasion and believe arrangement can be work out which will help to meet those concern and make possible for both security and freedom to exist in this troubled area for be not the freedom of west|berlin which be abnormal in germany today but the situation in that entire divided country if anyone doubt the legality of right in berlin be ready to have submit to international adjudication if anyone doubt the extent to which presence be desire by the people of west|berlin compare to east|german feeling about regime be ready to have that question submit to a free vote in berlin and if possible among all the german people and let hear at that time from the and half|million refugee who have flee the communist regime in east|germany voting for western type freedom with foot the world be not deceive by the communist attempt to label berlin as a hot bed of war there be peace in berlin today the source of world trouble and tension be moscow not berlin and if war begin will have begin in moscow and not berlin for the choice of peace or war be largely theirs not ours be the soviet who have stir up this crisis be who be try to force a change be who have oppose free election be who have reject an all german peace treaty and the ruling of international law and as americans know from history on own old frontier gun battle be cause by outlaw and not by officer of the peace in short while be ready to defend interest shall also be ready to search for peace in quiet exploratory talk in formal or informal meeting do not want military consideration to dominate the thinking of either east or west and mr. khrushchev may find that invitation to other nation to join in a meaningless treaty may lead to invite to join in the community of peaceful man in abandon the use of force and in respect the sanctity of agreement while all of these effort go on must not be divert from total responsibility from other danger from other task if new threat in berlin or elsewhere should cause to weaken program of assistance to the develop nation who be also under heavy pressure from the same source or to halt effort for realistic disarmament or to disrupt or slow down economy or to neglect the education of child then those threat will surely be the most successful and least costly maneuver in communist history for can afford all these effort and more but can not afford not to meet this challenge and the challenge be not to alone be a challenge to every nation which assert sovereignty under a system of liberty be a challenge to all those who want a world of free choice be a special challenge to the|atlantic|community the heartland of human freedom in the west must move together in build military strength must consult one another more closely than ever before must together design proposal for peace and labor together as be press at the conference table and together must share the burden and the risk of this effort the|atlantic|community as know have be build in response to challenge the challenge of european chaos in of the berlin blockade in the challenge of communist aggression in korea in now stand strong and prosperous after an|unprecedented|decade of progress the|atlantic|community will not forget either history or the principle which give meaning the solemn vow each of give to west|berlin in time of peace will not be break in time of danger if do not meet commitment to berlin where will later stand if be not true to word there all that have achieve in collective security which rely on these word will mean nothing and if there be path above all other to war be the path of weakness and disunity today the endanger frontier of freedom run through divide berlin want to remain a frontier of peace this be the hope of every citizen of the|atlantic|community every citizen of and be confident every citizen of the|soviet|union for can not believe that the russian people who bravely suffer enormous loss in the|second|world|war would now wish to see the peace upset once more in germany the soviet government alone can convert berlin 's frontier of peace into a pretext for war the step have indicate tonight be aim at avoid that war to sum all up seek peace but shall not surrender that be the central meaning of this crisis and the meaning of government 's policy with help and the help of other free man this crisis can be surmount freedom can prevail and peace can endure would like to close with a personal word when run for the presidency of the|united|state know that this country face serious challenge but could not realize nor could any man realize who do not bear the burden of this office how heavy and constant would be those burden time in life time country and europe have be involve in major war in each case serious misjudgment be make on both side of the intention of other which bring about great devastation now in the thermonuclear age any misjudgment on either side about the intention of the other could rain more devastation in several|hours than have be work in all the war of human history therefore as president and commander in chief and all of as americans be move through serious|day shall bear this responsibility under constitution for half|years but be sure that all regardless of occupation will do very good for country and for cause for all of want to see child grow up in a country at peace and in a world where freedom endure know that sometimes get impatient wish for some immediate action that would end peril but must tell that there be no quick and easy solution the communists control over a people and recognize that if should falter success would be imminent must look to long day ahead which if be courageous and persevering can bring what all desire in these|day and week ask for help and advice ask for suggestion when think could do better all of know love country and shall all do good to serve in meet responsibility in these|coming|months as president need good will and support and above all prayer thank and good night view transcript transcript admiral mr. secretary member of the|joint|chiefs|of|staff member of the faculty member of the|graduating|class and family be proud as a citizen of the|united|state to come to this institution and this room where there be concentrate so many man who have commit to the defense of the|united|state be honor to be here in the past have have some slight contact with this service though never do reach the state of professional and physical perfection where could hope that anyone would ever mistake for an annapolis graduate know that be constantly warn during day here not to mix in naval career in politic should point out however on the other side that rather rapid rise from a reserve lieutenant of uncertain standing to commander in chief have be because do not follow that very good advice trust however that those of who be regulars will for a moment grant a retire civilian officer some measure of fellowship nearly|a|half|century|ago president woodrow|wilson come here to annapolis on a similar mission and address the|class|of|1914 on that|day the graduate class number man there have be since that time a revolution in the size of military establishment and that revolution have be reflect in the revolution in the world around when wilson address the class in the victorian structure of power be still intact the world be dominate by europe and europe be the scene of an uneasy balance of power between dominant figure and america be a spectator on a remote sideline the autumn after wilson come to annapolis the victorian world begin to fall to piece and world half|a|century|later be vastly different today be witness to the most extraordinary revolution nearly in the history of the world as the emergent nation of latin|america africa and asia awaken from long century of torpor and impatience today the victorian certitude 's which be take to be so much a part of man 's natural existence be under siege by a faith commit to the destruction of liberal civilization and today be no longer the spectator but the leader this|half|century therefore have not only revolutionize the size of military establishment have bring about also a more striking revolution in the thing that the nation expect from the man in service fifty|years|ago the graduate of the|naval|academy be expect to be seaman and leader of man be remind of the saying of john|paul|jone give a fair ship so that may go into harm 's way when captain mahan begin to write in the ninety on the general issue of war and peace and naval strategy the navy quickly ship to sea duty today expect all of in fact must of necessity be prepare not only to handle a ship in a storm or a land party on a beach but to make great determination which affect the survival of this country the revolution in the technology of war make necessary in order that when hold position of command may make an educated judgment between various technique that also be a scientist and an engineer and a physicist and responsibility go far beyond the classic problem of tactic and strategy in the|year to come some of will serve as commandant do last|year as an adviser to foreign government some will negotiate as admiral burke do in korea with other government on behalf of the|united|state some will go to the far reach of space and some will go to the bottom of the ocean many of from time or another in the position of command or as member of staff will participate in great decision which go far beyond the narrow reach of professional competence gentleman therefore have a most important responsibility to recognize that education be just begin and to be prepare in the most difficult period in the life of country to play the role that the country hope and need and expect from must understand not only this country but other country must know something about strategy and tactic and logic logistic but also economic and politic and diplomacy and history must know everything can know about military power and must also understand the limit of military power must understand that few of the important problem of time have in the final analysis be finally solve by military power alone when say that officer today must go far beyond the official curriculum say not because do not believe in the traditional relationship between the civilian and the military but must be more than the servant of national policy must be prepared to play a constructive role in the development of national policy a policy which protect interest and security and the peace of the world woodrow|wilson remind predecessor that be not serve a government or an administration but a people in serve the american people represent the american people and the good of the ideal of this free society posture and performance will provide many people far beyond shore who know very little of country the only evidence will ever see as to whether america be truly dedicated to the cause of justice and freedom in inaugural address say that each citizen should be concern not with what country can do for but what can do for country what have choose to do for country by devote life to the service of country be the great contribution that any man could make be easy for in a moment of exhilaration today to say that freely and gladly dedicate life to the|united|state but the life of service be a constant test of will will be hard at time to face the personal sacrifice and the family inconvenience to maintain this high resolve to place the need of country above all else when there be a visible enemy to fight the tide of patriotism in this country run strong but when there be a long slow struggle with no immediate visible foe when watch contemporary indulge the urge for material gain and comfort and personal advancement choice will seem hard and will recall be sure the line find in an old sentry box at gibraltar god and the soldier all man adore in time of trouble and no more for when war be over and all thing right god be neglect and the old soldier slight never forget however that the battle for freedom take many form those who through vigilance and firmness and devotion be the great servant of this country and let have no doubt that the|united|states need devoted assistance today the answer to those who challenge so severely in so many part of the globe lie in willingness to freely commit to the maintenance of country and the thing for which stand this ceremony today represent the kind of commitment which be willing to make for that reason be proud to be here this nation salute as commence service to country in and on behalf of all of congratulate and thank view transcript

vienna of london be generous in greeting be heartwarme in hospitality and graciousness to wife be particularly appreciate know of course that the crowd and the shout be mean in large measure for the country that represent which be regard as the chief defender of freedom equally memorable be the pageantry of european history and culture that be very much a part of any ceremonial reception to lay a wreath at the|arc|de|triomphe to dine at versailles and schonbrunn|palace and with the|queen|of|england these be the colorful memory that will remain with for many year to come each of the city that visit paris vienna and london have exist for many|centurie and each serve as a reminder that the western civilization that seek to preserve have flower over many|years and have defend over many

achievement of a last peace trip be devoted to the advancement of these aim to strengthen the unity of the west journey open in paris and close in london talk with general de|gaulle be profoundly encouraging to certain difference in attitude on or another problem become insignificant in view of common commitment to defend freedom alliance believe become more secure the friendship of nation hope with become firm and the relation between the of who bear responsibility become close and hope be mark by confidence find general de|gaulle far more interested in frankly state position whether or not be own than in appear to agree with when do not but know full well the true meaning of an alliance be after all the only major leader of world|war|ii who still occupy a position of great responsibility life have be of unusual dedication be a man of extraordinary personal character symbolize the new strength and the historic grandeur of france throughout discussion take the long view of france and the world at large find a wise counselor for the future and an informative guide to the history that have help to make thus have a valuable meeting believe that certain doubt and suspicion that may have come up in a long time believe be remove on both side problem which prove to be not of substance but of wording or procedure be clear away no question however sensitive be

paris for vienna with increase confidence in western unity and strength the people of vienna know what be to live under occupation and know what be to live in freedom welcome to as president of this country should be heartwarme to all go to vienna to meet the leader of the|soviet|union mr. khrushchev for 2|day meet in sober intensive conversation and believe be obligation to the people to the congress and to ally to report on those conversation candidly and publicly mr. khrushchev and have a very full and frank exchange of view on the major issue that now divide country will tell now that be a very sober 2|day there be no discourtesy no loss of temper no threat or ultimatum by either side no advantage or concession be either gain or give no major decision be either plan or take no spectacular progress be either achieve or pretend this kind of informal exchange may not be as exciting as a full fledged summit meeting with a fix agenda and a large corps of adviser where negotiation be attempt and new agreement seek but this be not intend to be and be not such a meeting nor do plan any future summit meeting at vienna but find this meeting with chairman khrushchev as somber as be to be immensely useful have read speech and of policy have be advise on view have be tell by other leader of the west general de|gaulle chancellor adenauer prime minister macmillan what manner of man be but bear the responsibility of the presidency of the|united|state and be duty to make decision that no adviser and no ally can make for be obligation and responsibility to see that

desire peace with all nation of every kind want to present view to directly precisely realistically and with an opportunity for discussion and clarification this be do no new aim be state in private that have not be state in public on either side the gap between be not in such a short period materially reduce but at least the channel of communication be open more fully at least the chance of a dangerous misjudgment on either side should now be less and at least the man on whose decision the peace in part depend have agree to remain in contact this be important for neither of try to merely please the other to agree merely to be agreeable to say what the other want to hear and just as judicial system rely on witness appear in court and on cross - examination instead of hearsay testimony or affidavit on paper so too be this direct give and take of immeasurable value in make clear and precise what consider to be vital for the fact of the matter be that the soviets and give wholly different meaning to the same word war peace democracy and popular will have wholly different view of right and wrong of what be an internal affair and what be aggression and above all have wholly different concept of where the world be and where be go only by such a discussion be possible for to be sure that mr. khrushchev know how differently view the present and the future view contrast sharply but at least know better at the end where both stand neither of be there to dictate a settlement or to convert the other to a cause or to concede basic interest but both of be there think because realize that each nation have the power to inflict enormous damage upon the other that such a war could and should be avoid if at all possible since would settle no dispute and prove no doctrine and that care should thus be take to prevent conflict interest from so directly confront each other that war necessarily ensue believe in a system of national freedom and independence believe in an expanding and dynamic concept of world communism and the question be whether these system can ever hope to live in peace without permit any loss of security or any denial of the freedom of friend however difficult may seem to answer this question in the affirmative as approach so many harsh test think owe to all mankind to make every possible effort that be why consider the vienna talk to be useful the somber mood that convey be not cause for elation or relaxation nor be cause for undue pessimism or fear simply demonstrate how much work in the free world have to do and how long and hard a struggle must be fate as americans in this generation as the chief defender of the cause of liberty the area which afford some immediate prospect of accord be laos both side recognize the need to reduce the danger in that situation both side endorse the concept of a neutral and independent laos much in the manner of burma or cambodia of critical importance to the current conference on laos in geneva both side recognize the importance of an effective cease fire be urgent that this be translate into new attitude at geneva enable the|international|control|commission to do duty to make certain that a cease fire be enforce and maintain be hopeful that progress can be make on this matter in the|coming|days at geneva for that would greatly improve international atmosphere no such hope emerge however with respect to the other deadlocked geneva conference seek a treaty to ban nuclear test mr. khrushchev make clear that there could not be a neutral administrator in opinion because no one be truly neutral that a soviet veto would have to apply to act of enforcement that inspection be only a subterfuge for espionage in the absence of total disarmament and that the present test ban negotiation appear futile in short hope for an end to nuclear test for an end to the spread of nuclear weapon and for some slowing down of the arm race have be strike a serious blow nevertheless the stake be too important for to abandon the draft treaty have offer at geneva but most somber talk be on the subject of germany and berlin make clear to mr. khrushchev that the security of western|europe and therefore own security be deeply involved in presence and access right to west|berlin that those right be base on law and not on sufferance and that be determined to maintain those right at any risk and thus meet obligation to the people of west|berlin and right to choose own future mr. khrushchev in turn present view in detail and presentation will be the subject of further communication but be not seek to change the present situation a bind german peace treaty be a matter for all who be at war with germany and and ally can not abandon obligation to the people of west|berlin generally mr. khrushchev do not talk in term of war believe the world will move way without resort to force speak of nation 's achievement in space stress intention to outdo in industrial production to out trade to prove to the world the superiority of system over our most of all predict the triumph of communism in the new and less developed country be certain that the tide there be move way that the revolution of rise people would eventually be a communist revolution and that the so call war of liberation support by the kremlin would replace the old method of direct aggression and invasion in the 's and early fifty the great danger be from communist army march across free border which see in korea nuclear monopoly help to prevent this in other area now face a new and different threat no longer have a nuclear monopoly missile believe will hold off missile and troop can match troop should intervene in these so call war of liberation thus the local conflict support can turn in favor through guerrilla or insurgent or subversion a small group of discipline communists could exploit discontent and misery in a country where the average income may be or a year and seize control therefore of an entire country without communist troop ever cross any international frontier this be the communist theory but believe just as strongly that time will prove wrong that liberty and independence and self determination not communism be the future of man and that free man have the will and the resource to win the struggle for freedom but be clear that this struggle in this area of the new and poor nation will be a continue crisis of this|decade mr. khrushchev make point which wish to pass on say there be many disorder throughout the world and should not be blame for all be quite right be easy to dismiss as communist inspire every anti - government or anti - american riot every overthrow of a corrupt regime or every mass protest against misery and despair these be not all communist inspire the communists move in to exploit to infiltrate leadership to ride crest to victory but the communists do not create the condition which cause in short the hope for freedom in these area which see so much poverty and illiteracy so many child who be sick so many child who die in the|first|year so many family without home so many family without hope the future for freedom in these area rest with the local people and government if have the will to determine own future if government have the support of own people if honest and progressive measure help people have inspire confidence and zeal then no guerrilla or insurgent action can succeed but where those condition do not exist a military guarantee against external attack from across a border offer little protection against internal decay yet all this do not mean that nation and the west and the free world can only sit by on the contrary have an historic opportunity to help these country build society until be so strong and broadly base that only an outside invasion could topple and that threat know can be stop can train and equip force to resist communist supply insurrection can help develop the industrial and agricultural base on which new living standard can be build can encourage well administration and well education and well tax and land distribution and a well life for the people all this and more can do because have the talent and the resource to do if will only use and share know that there be a great deal of feel in the|united|state that have carry the burden of economic assistance long enough but these country that be now support stretch all the way along from the top of europe through the|middle|east down through saigon be now subject to great effort internally in many of to seize control if be not prepared to assist in make a well life for people then believe that the prospect for freedom in those area be uncertain must believe assist if be determined to meet with commitment of assistance word against the communist advance the burden be heavy have carry for many|years but believe that this fight be not over this battle go on and have to play part in and therefore hope again that will assist these people so that can remain free be fit that congress open hearing on new foreign military and economic aid program in washington at the very time that mr. khrushchev 's word in vienna be demonstrate as nothing else could the need for that very program should be well run effectively administer but believe must do and hope that the american people will support again because think be vitally important to the security of these area there be no use talk against the communist advance unless be willing to meet responsibility however burdensome may be do not justify this aid merely on the ground of anti - communism be a recognition of opportunity and obligation to help these people be free and be not alone find that the people of france for example be do far more in africa in the way of aid independent nation than own country be but know that foreign aid be a burden that be keenly feel and can only say that have no more crucial obligation now stay in england be short but the visit give a chance to confer privately again with prime minister macmillan just as other of party in vienna be confer yesterday with general de|gaulle and chancellor adenauer all agree that there be work to be do in the west and from conversation have come agree step to get on with that work day in london cap by a meeting with queen|elizabeth and prince|philip be a strong reminder at the end of a long journey that the west remain united in determination to hold to standard may conclude by say simply that be glad to be home have on this trip admire splendid place and see stirring sight but be glad to be home no demonstration of support abroad could mean so much as the support which the american people have so generously give to country with that support be not fearful of the future must be patient must be determine must be courageous must accept both risk and burden but with the will and the work freedom will prevail good night and thank very much good evening fellow citizen return this|morn from a week long trip to europe and want to report to on that trip in full be in every sense an unforgettable experience the people of paris of vienna of london be generous in greeting be heartwarme in hospitality and graciousness to wife be particularly appreciate know of course that the crowd and the shout be mean in large measure for the country that represent which be regard as the chief defender of freedom equally memorable be the pageantry of european history and culture that be very much a part of any ceremonial reception to lay a wreath at the|arc|de|triomphe to dine at versailles and schonbrunn|palace and with the|queen|of|england these be the colorful memory that will remain with for many year to come each of the city that visit paris vienna and london have exist for many|centurie and each serve as a reminder that the western civilization that seek to preserve have flower over many|years and have defend over many century but this be not a ceremonial trip aim of american foreign policy above all other be the reason for the trip the unity of the free world whose strength be the security of all and the eventual achievement of a last peace trip be devoted to the advancement of these aim to strengthen the unity of the west journey open in paris and close in london talk with general de|gaulle be profoundly encouraging to certain difference in attitude on or another problem become insignificant in view of common commitment to defend freedom alliance believe become more secure the friendship of nation hope with become firm and the relation between the of who bear responsibility become close and hope be mark by confidence find general de|gaulle far more interested in frankly state position whether or not be own than in appear to agree with when do not but know full well the true meaning of an alliance be after all the only major leader of world|war|ii who still occupy a position of great responsibility life have be of unusual dedication be a man of extraordinary personal character symbolize the new strength and the historic grandeur of france throughout discussion take the long view of france and the world at large find a wise counselor for the future and an informative guide to the history that have help to make thus have a valuable meeting believe that certain doubt and suspicion that may have come up in a long time believe be remove on both side problem which prove to be not of substance but of wording or procedure be clear away no question however sensitive be avoid no area of interest be ignore and the conclusion that reach will be important for the future in agreement on defend berlin on work to improve the defense of europe on aid the economic and political independence of the underdeveloped world include latin|america on spur european economic unity on conclude successfully the conference on laos and on close consultation and solidarity in the western alliance general de|gaulle could not have be more cordial and could not have more confidence in any man in addition to individual strength of character the french people as a whole show vitality and energy which be both impressive and gratifying recovery from the postwar period be dramatic productivity be increase and be steadily build stature in both europe and africa and thus leave paris for vienna with increase confidence in western unity and strength the people of vienna know what be to live under occupation and know what be to live in freedom welcome to as president of this country should be heartwarme to all go to vienna to meet the leader of the|soviet|union mr. khrushchev for 2|day meet in sober intensive conversation and believe be obligation to the people to the congress and to ally to report on those conversation candidly and publicly mr. khrushchev and have a very full and frank exchange of view on the major issue that now divide country will tell now that be a very sober 2|day there be no discourtesy no loss of temper no threat or ultimatum by either side no advantage or concession be either gain or give no major decision be either plan or take no spectacular progress be either achieve or pretend this kind of informal exchange may not be as exciting as a full fledged summit meeting with a fix agenda and a large corps of adviser where negotiation be attempt and new agreement seek but this be not intend to be and be not such a meeting nor do plan any future summit meeting at vienna but find this meeting with chairman khrushchev as somber as be to be immensely useful have read speech and of policy have be advise on view have be tell by other leader of the west general de|gaulle chancellor adenauer prime minister macmillan what manner of man be but bear the responsibility of the presidency of the|united|state and be duty to make decision that no adviser and no ally can make for be obligation and responsibility to see that these decision be as inform as possible that be base on as much direct firsthand knowledge as possible therefore think be of immense importance that know mr. khrushchev that gain as much insight and understanding as could on present and future policy at the same time want to make certain mr. khrushchev know this country and policy that understand strength and determination and that know that desire peace with all nation of every kind want to present view to directly precisely realistically and with an opportunity for discussion and clarification this be do no new aim be state in private that have not be state in public on either side the gap between be not in such a short period materially reduce but at least the channel of communication be open more fully at least the chance of a dangerous misjudgment on either side should now be less and at least the man on whose decision the peace in part depend have agree to remain in contact this be important for neither of try to merely please the other to agree merely to be agreeable to say what the other want to hear and just as judicial system rely on witness appear in court and on cross - examination instead of hearsay testimony or affidavit on paper so too be this direct give and take of immeasurable value in make clear and precise what consider to be vital for the fact of the matter be that the soviets and give wholly different meaning to the same word war peace democracy and popular will have wholly different view of right and wrong of what be an internal affair and what be aggression and above all have wholly different concept of where the world be and where be go only by such a discussion be possible for to be sure that mr. khrushchev know how differently view the present and the future view contrast sharply but at least know better at the end where both stand

government gentleman and lady the constitution impose upon the obligation to from time to time give to the congress information of the|state|of|the|union while this have traditionally be interpret as an annual affair this tradition have be break in extraordinary time these be extraordinary time and face an extraordinary challenge strength as well as conviction have impose upon this nation the role of leader in freedom 's cause no role in history could be more difficult or more important stand for freedom that be conviction for that be only commitment to other no friend no neutral and no adversary should think otherwise be not against any man or any nation or any system except as be hostile to freedom nor be here to present a new military doctrine bear any name or aim at any area be here to promote the freedom doctrine the great battleground for the defense and expansion of freedom today be the whole southern half of the globe — asia latin|america africa and the|middle|east the land of the rise people revolution be the great in human history seek an end to injustice tyranny and exploitation more than an end seek a beginning and be a revolution which would support regardless of and regardless of which political or economic route should choose to freedom for the adversary of freedom do not create the revolution nor do create the condition which compel but be seek to ride the crest of wave to capture for yet aggression be more often conceal than open have fire no missile and troop be seldom see send arm agitator aid technician and propaganda to every troubled area but where fighting be require be usually do by other by guerrilla strike at night by assassin strike alone assassin who have take the life of four|thousand civil officer in in vietnam alone by subversive

house|of|representatif be omit in the reading of the message possess a powerful intercontinental strike force large force for conventional war a well train underground in nearly every country the power to conscript talent and manpower for any purpose the capacity for quick decision a closed society without dissent or free information and long experience in the technique of violence and subversion make the most of scientific success economic progress and pose as a foe of colonialism and friend of popular revolution prey on unstable or unpopular government unsealed or unknown boundary unfilled hope convulsive change massive poverty illiteracy unrest and frustration with these formidable weapon the adversary of freedom plan to consolidate territory to exploit to control and finally to destroy the hope of the world 's new nation and have ambition to do before the|end|of|this|decade be a contest of will and purpose as well as force and violence a battle for mind and soul as well as life and territory and in that contest can not stand aside stand as have always stand from early beginning for the independence and equality of all nation this nation be bear of revolution and raise in freedom and do not intend to leave an open road for despotism there be no single simple policy which meet this challenge experience have teach that no nation have the power or the wisdom to solve all the problem of the world or manage revolutionary tide that extend commitment do not always increase security that any initiative carry with the risk of a temporary defeat — that nuclear weapon can not prevent subversion that no free people can be keep free without will and energy of own — and that no nation or situation be exactly alike yet there be much can do — and must do the proposal bring before be numerous and varied arise from the host of special opportunity and danger which have become increasingly clear in recent|months take together believe that can mark another step forward in effort as a people be here to ask the help of this congress and the nation in approve these necessary measure ii economic and social|progress|at home the first and basic task confront this nation this|year be to turn recession into recovery an affirmative anti - recession program initiate with cooperation support the natural force in the private sector and economy be now enjoy renew confidence and energy the recession have be halt recovery be under way but the task of abating unemployment and achieve a full use of resource do remain a serious challenge for all large scale unemployment during a recession be bad enough but large scale unemployment during a period of prosperity would be intolerable be therefore transmit to the congress a new manpower|development and training program to train or retrain several|hundred|thousand worker particularly in those area where have see chronic unemployment as a result of technological factor in new occupational skill over a year period in order to replace those skill make obsolete by automation and industrial change with the new skill which the new process demand should be a satisfaction to all that have make great stride in restore world confidence in the dollar halt the outflow of gold and improve balance of payment during the|last|two|month gold stock actually increase by seventeen|million|dollars compare to a loss of during the|last|two|months|of|1960 must maintain this progress and this will require the cooperation and restraint of everyone as recovery progress there will be temptation to seek unjustified price and wage increase these can not afford will only handicap effort to compete abroad and to achieve full recovery here at home labor and management must — and be confident that will pursue responsible wage and price policy in these critical time look to on labor management policy to give a strong lead in this direction moreover if the budget deficit now increase by the need of security be to be hold within manageable proportion will be necessary to hold tightly to prudent fiscal standard and request the cooperation of the congress in this regard to refrain from add fund or program desirable as may be to the budget to end the postal deficit as predecessor also recommend through increase rate a deficit incidentally this|year which exceed the fiscal|1962 cost of all the space and defense measure that be submit today to provide full pay as go highway financing and to close those tax loophole earlier specify security and progress can not be cheaply purchase and price must be find in what all forego as well as what all must pay economic and social progres abroad stress the strength of economy because be essential to the strength of nation and what be true in case be true in the case of other country strength in the struggle for freedom depend on the strength of economic and social progress would be badly mistaken to consider problem in military term alone for no amount of arm and army can help stabilize those government which be unable or unwilling to achieve social and economic reform and development military pact can not help nation whose social injustice and economic chaos invite insurgency and penetration and subversion the most skillful counter - guerrilla effort can not succeed where the local population be too catch up in own misery to be concern about the advance of communism but for those who share this view stand ready now as have in the past to provide generously of skill and capital and food to assist the people of the less develop nation to reach goal in freedom to help before be engulf in crisis this be also great opportunity in if grasp then subversion to prevent success be expose as an unjustifiable attempt to keep these nation from either be free or equal but if do not pursue and if do not pursue the bankruptcy of unstable government by and of unfilled hope will surely lead to a series of totalitarian receivership earlier|in|the|year outline to the congress a new program for aid emerge nation and be intention to transmit shortly draft legislation to implement this program to establish a new act|for|international|development and to add to the figure previously request in view of the swift pace of critical event an|additional|250|million|dollars for a|presidential|contingency|fund to be use only upon a presidential determination in each case with regular and complete report to the congress in each case when there be a sudden and extraordinary drain upon regular fund which can not foresee — as illustrate by recent event in southeast|asia and make necessary the use of this emergency reserve the total amount request — now raise to be both minimal and crucial do not see how anyone who be concerned as all be about the grow threat to freedom around the globe and who be ask what more can do as a people can weaken or oppose the single most important program available for build the frontier of freedom iv all that have say make clear that be engage in a world wide struggle in which bear a heavy burden to preserve and promote the ideal that share with all mankind or have alien ideal force upon that struggle have highlight the role of information|agency be essential that the fund previously request for this effort be not only approve in full but increase by to a total of this new request be for additional radio and television to latin|america and southeast|asia these tool be particularly effective and essential in the city and village of those great continent as a means of reach million of uncertain people to tell of interest in fight for freedom in latin|america be propose to increase spanish and portuguese broadcast to a total of a week compare to today none of which be in portuguese the language of about|one third of the people of the soviets red|chinese and satellite already broadcast into latin|america more|than|134|hour a week in spanish and portuguese communist china alone do more public information broadcasting in own hemisphere than do moreover powerful propaganda broadcast from havana now be hear throughout latin|america encourage new revolution in several country similarly in laos vietnam cambodia and thailand must communicate determination and support to those upon whom hope for resist the communist tide in that continent ultimately depend interest be in the truth defense but while talk of sharing and building and the competition of idea other talk of arm and threaten war so have learn to keep defense strong and to cooperate with other in a partnership of self defense the event of recent|week have cause to look anew at these effort the center of freedom 's defense be network of world alliance extend from nato recommend by a democratic president and approve by a republican congress to seato recommend by a republican president and approve by a democratic congress these alliance be construct in the 's and 1950' be task and responsibility in the 's to strengthen to meet the change condition of power and power relationship have change have endorse an increase emphasis on nato 's conventional strength at the same time be affirm conviction that the nato nuclear deterrent must also be keep strong have make clear intention to commit to the nato command for this purpose the polaris submarine originally suggest by president eisenhower with the possibility if need of more to come second a major part of partnership for self defense be the|military|assistance|program the main burden of local defense against local attack subversion insurrection or guerrilla warfare must of necessity rest with local force where these force have the necessary will and capacity to cope with such threat intervention be rarely necessary or helpful where the will be present and only capacity be lack military|assistance|program can be of help but this program like economic assistance need a new emphasis can not be extend without regard to the social political and military reform essential to internal respect and stability the equipment and training provide must be tailor to legitimate local need and to own foreign and military policy not to supply of military stock or a local leader 's desire for military display and military assistance can in addition to military purpose make a contribution to economic progress as do own army|engineer in an early message request for military assistance state that this would maintain exist force level but that could not foresee how much more may be require be now clear that this be not enough the present crisis in southeast|asia on which the vice president have make a valuable report the rise threat of communism in latin|america the increase arm traffic in africa — and all the new pressure on every nation find on the map by trace finger along the border of the communist bloc in asia and the|middle|east all make clear the dimension of need therefore request the congress to provide a total of 1.885|billion|dollar for military assistance in an amount less than that request a|year|ago but a minimum which must be assure if be to help those nation make secure independence this must be prudently and wisely spend and that will be common endeavor military and economic assistance have be a heavy burden on citizen for a long time and recognize the strong pressure against but this battle be far from over be reach a crucial stage and believe should participate in can not merely state opposition to totalitarian advance without pay the price of help those now under the great pressure vi our own military and intelligence in line with these development have direct a further reinforcement of own capacity to deter or resist non - nuclear aggression in the conventional field with exception find no present need for large new levy of man what be need be rather a change of position to give still further increase in flexibility therefore be direct the secretary of defense to undertake a reorganization and modernization of the army 's divisional structure to increase non - nuclear firepower to improve tactical mobility in any environment to insure flexibility to meet any direct or indirect threat to facilitate coordination with major ally and to provide more modern mechanized division in europe and bring equipment up to date and new airborne brigade in both the pacific and europe and secondly be ask the congress for an|additional|100|million|dollars to begin the procurement task necessary to re - equip this new army structure with the most modern material new helicopter new armored personnel carrier and new howitzer for example must be obtain now third be direct the secretary of defense to expand rapidly and substantially in cooperation with allies the orientation of exist force for the conduct of nonnuclear war para military operation and sub limit or unconventional war in addition special force and unconventional warfare unit will be increase and reorient throughout the service new emphasis must be place on the special skill and language which be require to work with local population fourth the army be develop plan to make possible a much more rapid deployment of a major portion of highly train reserve force when these plan be complete and the reserve be strengthen combat equip division plus support force a total of man could be ready in an emergency for operation with but notice—2 more division with but notice and additional division and support force make a total of division could be deployable with less|than|8|week ' notice in short these new plan will allow to almost double the combat power of the army in less|than|two|months compare to the|nearly|nine|months heretofore require fifth to enhance the already formidable ability of the|marine|corp to respond to limited war emergency be ask the congress for to increase the marine|corps strength to man this will increase the initial impact and stay power of marine division and air wing and provide a train nucleus for further expansion if necessary for self defense finally to cite other area of activity that be both legitimate and necessary as a means of self defense in an age of hide peril whole intelligence effort must be review and coordination with other element of policy assure the congress and the american people be entitle to know that will institute whatever new organization policy and control be necessary vii civil defense major element of the national security program which this nation have never squarely face up to be civil defense this problem arise not from present trend but from national inaction in which most of have participate in the|past|decade have intermittently consider a variety of program but have never adopt a consistent policy public consideration have be largely characterize by apathy indifference and skepticism while at the same time many of the civil defense plan have be so far reach and unrealistic that have not gain essential support this administration have be look hard at exactly what civil defense can and can not do can not be obtain cheaply can not give an assurance of blast protection that will be proof against surprise attack or guarantee against obsolescence or destruction and can not deter a nuclear attack will deter an enemy from make a nuclear attack only if retaliatory power be so strong and so invulnerable that know would be destroy by response if have that strength civil defense be not need to deter an attack if should ever lack civil defense would not be an adequate substitute but this deterrent concept assume rational calculation by rational man and the history of this planet and particularly the history of the|20th|century be sufficient to remind of the possibility of an irrational attack a miscalculation an accidental war for a war of escalation in which the stake by each side gradually increase to the point of maximum danger which can not be either foresee or deter be on this basis that civil defense can be readily justifiable — as insurance for the civilian population in case of an enemy miscalculation be insurance trust will never be need — but insurance which could never forgive for forego in the event of catastrophe once the validity of this concept be recognize there be no point in delay the initiation of a nation wide long range program of identify present fallout shelter capacity and provide shelter in new and exist structure such a program would protect million of people against the hazard of radioactive fallout in the event of large scale nuclear attack effective performance of the entire program not only require new legislative authority and more fund but also sound organizational arrangement therefore under the authority vest in by reorganization|plan no . of be assign responsibility for this program to the top civilian authority already responsible for continental defense the secretary of defense be important that this function remain civilian in nature and leadership and this feature will not be change the|office|of|civil|and|defense|mobilization will be reconstitute as a small staff agency to assist in the coordination of these function to more accurately describe role title should be change to the|office|of|emergency|planning as soon as those newly charge with these responsibility have prepare new authorization and appropriation request such request will be transmit to the congress for a much strengthen federal state civil defense program such a program will provide federal fund for identify fallout shelter capacity in exist structure and will include where appropriate incorporation of shelter in federal building new requirement for shelter in building construct with federal assistance and match grant and other incentive for construct shelter in state and local and private building federal appropriation for civil defense in fiscal|1962 under this program will in all likelihood be more than triple the pende budget request and will increase sharply in subsequent year financial participation will also be require from state and local government and from private citizen but no insurance be cost free and every american citizen and community must decide for whether this form of survival insurance justify the expenditure of effort time and money for be convinced that do viii disarmament can not end this discussion of defense and armament without emphasize strong hope the creation of an orderly world where disarmament will be possible aim do not prepare for war be effort to discourage and resist the adventure of other that could end in war that be why be consistent with these effort that continue to press for properly safeguard disarmament measure at geneva in cooperation with have put forward concrete proposal to make clear wish to meet the soviets half way in an effective nuclear test ban treaty the first significant but essential step on the road towards disarmament up to now response have not be what hope but mr. dean return last|night to geneva and intend to go the last mile in patience to secure this gain if can meanwhile be determined to keep disarmament high on agenda to make an intensified effort to develop acceptable political and technical alternative to the present arm race to this end shall send to the congress a measure to establish a strengthen and enlarge disarmament|agency ix space finally if be to win the battle that be now go on around the world between freedom and tyranny the dramatic achievement in space which occur in recent|weeks should have make clear to all as do the sputnik in the impact of this adventure on the mind of man everywhere who be attempt to make a determination of which road should take since early in term effort in space have be under review with the advice of the vice president who be chairman of the|national|space|council have examine where be strong and where be not where may succeed and where may not now be time to take long stride time for a great new american enterprise time for this nation to take a clearly lead role in space achievement which in many way may hold the key to future on earth believe possess all the resource and talent necessary but the fact of the matter be that have never make the national decision or marshal the national resource require for such leadership have never specify long range goal on an urgent time schedule or manage resource and time so as to insure fulfillment recognize the head start obtain by the soviets with large rocket engine which give many|month of lead time and recognize the likelihood that will exploit this lead for some time to come in still more impressive success nevertheless be require to make new effort on own for while can not guarantee that shall day be first can guarantee that any failure to make this effort will make last take an additional risk by make in full view of the world but as show by the feat of astronaut shepard this very risk enhance stature when be successful but this be not merely a race space be open to now and eagerness to share meaning be not govern by the effort of other go into space because whatever mankind must undertake free man must fully share therefore ask the congress above and beyond the increase have earlier request for space activity to provide the fund which be need to meet the follow national goal first believe that this nation should commit to achieve the goal before this|decade be out of land a man on the moon and return safely to the earth no single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind or more important for the long range exploration of space and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish propose to accelerate the development of the appropriate lunar space craft propose to develop alternate liquid and solid fuel booster much large than any now be develop until certain which be superior propose additional fund for other engine development and for unmanned exploration — exploration which be particularly important for purpose which this nation will never overlook the survival of the man who first make this dare flight but in a very real sense will not be man go to the moon if make this judgment affirmatively will be an entire nation for all of must work to put there secondly an|additional|23|million|dollar together with already available will accelerate development of the rover nuclear rocket this give promise of some|day provide a means for even more exciting and ambitious exploration of space perhaps beyond the moon perhaps to the very end of the solar system third an|additional|50|million|dollar will make the most of present leadership by accelerate the use of space satellite for world wide communication fourth an|additional|75|million|dollar of which be for the|weather|bureau will help give at the early possible time a satellite system for world wide weather observation let be clear and this be a judgment which the member of the congress must finally make — let be clear that be ask the congress and the country to accept a firm commitment to a new course of action a course which will last for many|year and carry very heavy cost in fiscal to nine|billion|dollar additional over if be to go only|half way or reduce sight in the face of difficulty in judgment would be well not to go at all now this be a choice which this country must make and be confident that under the leadership of the|space|committees|of|the congress and the appropriating committees that will consider the matter carefully be a most important decision that make as a nation but all of have live through and have see the significance of space and the adventure in space and no one can predict with certainty what the ultimate meaning will be of mastery of space believe should go to the moon but think every citizen of this country as well as the member of the congress should consider the matter carefully in make judgment to which have give attention over many|week and month because be a heavy burden and there be no sense in agree or desire that the|united|state take an affirmative position in outer space unless be prepared to do the work and bear the burden to make successful if be not should decide today and this|year this decision demand a major national commitment of scientific and technical manpower materiel and facility and the possibility of diversion from other important activity where be already thinly spread mean a degree of dedication organization and discipline which have not always characterize research and development effort mean can not afford undue work stoppage inflated cost of material or talent wasteful interagency rivalry or a high turnover of key personnel new objective and new money can not solve these problem could in fact aggravate further unless every scientist every engineer every serviceman every technician contractor and civil servant give personal pledge that this nation will move forward with the full speed of freedom in the exciting adventure of space x. conclusion in conclusion let emphasize point be not a pleasure for any president of the|united|state as be sure be not a pleasure for predecessor to come before the congress and ask for new appropriation which place burden on people come to this conclusion with some reluctance but in judgment this be a most serious time in the life of country and in the life of freedom around the globe and be the obligation believe of the president of the|united|state to at least make recommendation to the members of the congress so that can reach own conclusion with that judgment before must decide yourself as have decide and be confident that whether finally decide in the way that have decide or not that judgment as judgment be reach on what be in the good interest of country in conclusion let emphasize point that be determined as a nation in that freedom shall survive and succeed and whatever the peril and set back have some very large advantage the first be the simple fact that be on the side of liberty and since the beginning of history and particularly since the|end|of|the|second|world|war liberty have be win out all over the globe a second great asset be that be not alone have friend and ally all over the world who share devotion to freedom may cite as a symbol of traditional and effective friendship the great ally be about to visit — france look forward to visit to france and to discussion with a great captain of the western world president de|gaulle as a meeting of particular significance permit the kind of close and range consultation that will strengthen both country and serve the common purpose of world wide peace and liberty such serious conversation do not require a pale unanimity be rather the instrument of trust and understanding over a long road a third asset be desire for peace be sincere and believe the world know be prove in patience at the test ban table and be prove in the un where effort have be direct to maintain that organization 's usefulness as a protector of the independence of small nation in these and other instance the response of opponent have not be encourage yet be important to know that patience at the bargaining table be nearly inexhaustible though credulity be limited that hope for peace be unfailing while determination to protect security be resolute for these reason have long think wise to meet with the soviet premier for a personal exchange of view a meeting in vienna turn out to be convenient for both and the austrian government have kindly make welcome no formal agenda be plan and no negotiation will be undertake but will make dear america 's endure concern be for both peace and freedom that be anxious to live in harmony with the russian people that seek no conquest no satellite no riches that seek only when nation shall not lift up sword against nation neither shall learn war any more finally great asset in this struggle be the american people willingness to pay the price for these program to understand and accept a long struggle to share resource with other less fortunate people to meet the tax level and close the tax loophole have request to exercise self restraint instead of push up wage or price or over produce certain crop or spread military secret or urge unessential expenditure or improper monopoly or harmful work stoppage to serve in the|peace|corp or the|armed|service or the|federal|civil|service or the congress — to strive for excellence in school in city and in physical fitness and that of child to take part in civil|defense to pay high postal rate and high payroll taxis and high teacher ' salary in order to strengthen society to show friendship to student and visitor from other land who visit and go back in many case to be the future leader with an image of america — and want that image and know do to be affirmative and positive and finally to practice democracy at home in all states with all race to respect each other and to protect the constitutional right of all citizen have not ask for a single program which do not cause or all americans some inconvenience or some hardship or some sacrifice but have respond and in the congress have respond to duty and feel confident in ask today for a similar response to these new and large demand be hearten to know as journey abroad that country be unite in commitment to freedom and be ready to do duty view transcript transcript mr. speaker of the senate mr. speaker of the house mr. prime minister member of the|canadian|houses|of|parliament distinguished guest and friend be grateful for the generous remark and kind sentiment toward country and mr. prime minister in the|united|state have an impression that this country be make up of descendant of the english and the french but be glad to hear some applause come from the very back bench when mention ireland be sure be make progress forward.&nbsp je sen vraiment entre amis be a deeply feel honor to address this distinguished legislative body and yet may say that feel very much at home with here today for third of life be spend in the parliament of own country the|united|states|congress there be some difference between this body and own the most noticeable to be the lofty appearance of statesmanship which be on the face of the members of the senator who realize that will never have to place cause before the people again feel at home also here because number in own state of massachusetts many friend and former constituent who be of canadian descent among the voter of massachusetts who be bear outside the|united|state the large group by far be bear in canada vote be enough to determine the outcome of an election even a presidential election can understand that have be elect president of the|united|state by vote out of that be very conscious of these statistic the warmth of hospitality symbolize more than merely the courtesy which may be accord to an individual visitor symbolize the endure quality of amity and honor which have characterize country ' relation for so|many|decade nearly|forty|years|ago a distinguished prime minister of this country take the part of the|united|state at a disarmament conference say may not be angel but be at least friend must say that do not think that probably demonstrate in that|forty|years that be angel yet but hope have demonstrate that be at least friend and must say that think in these|days where hazard be constant companion that friend be a very good thing to have the prime minister be the first of the leader from other land who be invite to call upon shortly after enter and this be first trip the first trip of wife and outside of country 's border be just and fitting and appropriate and traditional that should come here to canada across a border that know neither gun nor guerrilla but share more than a common border share a common heritage trace back to those early settler who travel from the beachhead of the|maritime|province and new|england to the far reach of henry|thoreau speak a common sentiment for all eastward go only by force westward go free must walk towards oregon and not towards europe share common value from the past a common defense line at present and common aspiration for the future future and indeed the future of all mankind geography have make neighbor history have make friend economic have make partner and necessity have make ally those whom nature hath so join together let no man put asunder what unite be far great than what divide the issue and irritant that inevitably affect all neighbor be small deed in comparison with the issue that face together above all the somber threat now pose to the whole neighborhood of this continent in fact to the whole community of nation but alliance be bear not of fear but of hope be an alliance that advance what be for as well as oppose what be against and so be that when speak of common attitude and relationship canada and the|united|state speak in in term of unity do not seek the unanimity that come to those who water down all issue to the low common denominator or to those who conceal difference behind fix smile or to those who measure unity by standard of popularity and affection instead of trust and respect be ally this be a partnership not an empire be bind to have difference and disappointment and be equally bind to bring out into the open to settle where can be settle and to respect each other 's view when can not be settle thus ours be the unity of equal and independent nation co - tenant of the same continent heir of the same legacy and fully sovereign associate in the same historic endeavor to preserve freedom for and all who wish to that endeavor must bring great material and human resource the result of separate culture and independent economy and above all that endeavor require a free and full exchange of new and different idea on all issue and all undertaking for be clear that no free nation can stand alone to meet the threat of those who make adversary that no free nation can retain any illusion about the nature of the threat and that no free nation can remain indifferent to the steady erosion of freedom around the globe be equally clear that no western nation on own can help those less develop land to fulfill hope for steady progress and finally be clear that in an age where new force be assert strength around the globe when the political shape of the hemisphere be change rapidly nothing be more vital than the unity of the|united|state and of canada and so friend of canada whatever problem may exist or arise between can assure that associate and will be ever ready to discuss with and to take whatever step can to remove and whatever those problem may be can also assure that shrink in comparison with the great and awesome task that await as free and peace love nation so let fix attention not on those matter that vex as neighbor but on the issue that face as leader let look southward as part of the hemisphere with whose fate be both inextricably bind let look eastward as part of the|north|atlantic|community upon whose strength and will so many depend let look westward to japan to the newly emerge land of asia and africa and the|middle|east where lie the people upon whose fate and choice the struggle for freedom may ultimately depend and let look at the world in which live and hope to go on live and at the way of life for which canadians and be remind again of this|this|morning on visit to and americans alike have always be willing to give up life in nearly every generation if necessary to defend and preserve freedom first if will consider mutual hope for this hemisphere stretch virtually from pole to pole the nation of the|western|hemisphere be bind together by the law of economic as well as geography by a common dedication to freedom as well as a common history of fight for to make this entire area more secure against aggression of all kind to defend against the encroachment of international communism in this hemisphere and to see sister state fulfill hope and need for economic and social reform and development be surely all challenge confront nation and deserve of talent and resource as well as ours to be sure would mean an add responsibility but be not a nation that shrink from responsibility the hemisphere be a family into which be bear and can not turn back on in time of trouble nor can stand aside from great adventure of development believe that all of the free member of the|organization|of|american|state would be hearten and strengthen by any increase in hemispheric role skill resource judicious perception at the council table even when differ from own view be all need throughout the inter - american community country and mine be partner in north|american affair can not now become partner in inter - american affair secondly let consider mutual hope for the|north|atlantic|community nato alliance be still as be when be found the world 's great bulwark of freedom but the military balance of power have be change enemy tactic and weaponry have be change can stand still only at peril nato force structure be originally devise to meet the threat of a massive conventional attack in a period of western nuclear monopoly now if be to meet the defense requirement of the 's the nato country must push forward simultaneously along line first must strengthen the conventional capability of alliance as a matter of the high priority to this end in the|united|state be take step to increase the strength and mobility of force and to modernize equipment to the same end will maintain force now on the|european|continent and will increase conventional capability look to nato|allie to assign an equally high priority to this same essential task must make certain that nuclear weapon will continue to be available for the defense of the entire treaty area and that these weapon be at all time under close and flexible political control that meet the need of all the nato country be prepared to join allies in work out suitable arrangement for this purpose to make clear own intention and commitment to the defense of western|europe the|united|states will commit to the nato command and subsequently still more polaris atomic missile submarine which be defensive weapon subject to any agree nato guideline on control and use and responsive to the need of all member but still credible in an emergency beyond this look to the possibility of eventually establish a nato sea bear force which would be truly multi - lateral in ownership and control if this should be desire and find feasible by allies once nato 's non - nuclear goal have be achieve both of these measure improve conventional force and increase nuclear force be put forward in recognition of the fact that the defense of europe and the assurance that can be give to the people of europe and the defense of north|america be indivisible in the hope that no aggressor will mistake desire for peace with determination to respond instantly to any attack with whatever force be appropriate and in the conviction that the time have come for all member of the nato community to further increase and integrate respective force in the nato command area coordinate and sharing in research development production storage defense command and training at all level of armament so let begin opponent be watch to see if in the west be divide take courage when be must not let be deceive or in doubt about willingness to maintain own freedom third let turn to the less develop nation in the southern half of the globe those who struggle to escape the bond of mass misery which appeal to heart as well as to hope both nation and have recognize responsibility to these new nation people have give generously if not always effectively could not do less and now must do more for historic task in this embattle age be not merely to defend freedom be to extend writ and strengthen covenant to people of different culture and creed and color whose policy or economic system may differ from our but whose desire to be free be no less fervent than own through the|organization|for|economic|cooperation|and|development and the|development|assistance|group can pool vast resource and skill and make available the kind of long term capital planning and know how without which these nation will never achieve independent and viable economy and without which effort will be tragically waste propose further that the oecd establish a development center where citizen and official and student and professional man of the atlantic area and the less develop world can meet to study in common the problem of economic development if in the|atlantic|community can more closely coordinate own economic policy and certainly the oecd provide the framework if but use and hope that will join as be seek to join to use then surely potential economic resource be adequate to meet responsibility consider for example the unsurpassed productivity of farm less|than|8|percent of the american working force be on farm less|than|11|percent of the canadian working force be on few man on few acre than any nation on earth but free man on free acre can produce here in north|america all the food that a hungry world could use while all the collective farm and force labor of the communist system produce shortage after another this be a day to day miracle of free society easy to forget at a time when mind be catch up in the glamour of begin the exploration of space as the new nation emerge into independence face a choice shall develop by the method of consent or by turn freedom over to the system of totalitarian control in make that decision should look long and hard at the tragedy now be play out in the village of communist china if can work closely together to make food surplus a blessing instead of a curse no man woman or child need go hungry and if each of the more fortunate nation can bear fair share of the effort to help the less fortunate not merely those with whom have traditional tie but all who be willing and able to achieve meaningful growth and dignity then this|decade will surely be a turning point in the history of the human family finally let say just a few word about the world in which live should not misjudge the force of the challenge that face a force that be powerful as well as insidious that inspire dedication as well as fear that use mean can not adopt to achieve end can not permit nor can mistake the nature of the struggle be not for concession or territory be not simply between different system be an age old battle for the survival of liberty and great advantage and must never forget be that the irresistible tide that begin five|hundred|years before the birth of christ in ancient greece be for freedom and against tyranny and that be the wave of the future and the iron hand of totalitarianism can ultimately neither seize nor turn back in the word of macaulay a single breaker may recede but the tide be come in so in the free world be not without hope be not without friend and be not without resource to defend and those who be associate with believe in the peaceful settlement of dispute in the defense of human right be work throughout the|united|nation and through regional and other association to lessen the risk the tension and the mean and opportunity for aggression that have be mount so rapidly throughout the world in these council of peace in the|un|emergency|force in the|middle|east in the congo in the|international|control|commission in south|east|asia in the|ten|nations|commission|on|disarmament canada have play a leading important and constructive role if can contain the powerful struggle of ideology and reduce to manageable proportion can proceed with the transcendent task of discipline the nuclear weapon which shadow life and of find a widen range of common enterprise between and those who live under communist rule for in the end live on planet and be part of human family and whatever the struggle that confront must lose no chance to move forward towards a world of law and a world of disarmament at the conference table and in the mind of man the free world 's cause be strengthen because be just but be strengthen even more by the dedicated effort of free man and free nation as the great parliamentarian edmund|burke say the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil be for good man to do nothing and that in essence be why be here today this trip be more than a consultation more than a good will visit be an act of faith faith in country in leader faith in the capacity of great neighbor to meet common problem and faith in the cause of freedom in which be so intimately associate view transcript transcript mr. president want to express appreciation to the president and to the fellows of this university for the honor that have bestow upon wife beat to this honor by about or year take 2|year to get this degree and take but in any case be both grateful be also glad to be here because this university bear the distinguished name of the father of country george|washington be a matter of great interest that there have be an intimate relationship between the great political leader of country and college and university this university bear the name of george|washington which show understanding in of the necessity of a free society to produce educate man and woman john|adam and john|quincy|adams from own state|of|massachusett have an intimate relationship with harvard|university both of believe be member of the board of overseer in both of life harvard and development play a major part washington and lee show an intimate relationship for general lee the fact that be willing to devote life at the end of the war to educate the man and woman of the south indicate understanding of this basic precept woodrow|wilson theodore|roosevelt and all the rest do not think that there have ever be a time when have have great need for those quality which a university produce know that many people feel that a democracy be a divided system that where the communists be certain in purpose and certain in execution debate and talk and be unable to meet consistency and perseverance do not hold that view there be many disadvantage which a free society bear with in a cold war struggle but believe over the long run that people do want to be free that desire to develop own personality and own potential that democracy permit to do so and that be the job of school and college such as this to provide the man and woman who will with sense of discipline and purpose and understanding contribute to the maintenance of free society here and around the world a year ago george|william|curtis of own state ask a body of educator during the kansas nebraska controversy would have count a friend of ancient greece who quietly discuss the theory of patriotism on that hot summer|day through whose hopeless and immortal hour leonidas and the three|hundred stand at thermopylae for liberty be john|milton to conjugate greek verb in library when the liberty of englishmen be imperil no quite obviously the duty of the educate man or woman the duty of the scholar be to give objective sense sense of liberty to the maintenance of society at a critical time this be opportunity as well as responsibility and be particularly glad to be here today when be witness the swearing in of a new president many|years|ago as most of know at harvard|university somebody come around and ask for president lowell say be in washington see mr. taft know that when be ask for the president of university will say that be over at the|white|house see mr. kennedy understand at harvard and understand here the relative importance of a university president and a president of the|united|state thank view transcript transcript mr. chairman lady and gentleman appreciate very much generous invitation to be here tonight bear heavy responsibility these|days and an article read some time ago remind of how particularly heavily the burden of present day event bear upon profession may remember that in the|new|york|herald|tribune under the sponsorship and publishing of horace|greeley employ as london correspondent an obscure journalist by the name of karl|marx be tell that foreign correspondent marx stone break and with a family ill and undernourished constantly appeal to greeley and managing editor charles|dana for an increase in munificent salary of per installment a salary which and engels ungratefully label as the lousy petty bourgeois cheating but when all financial appeal be refuse marx look around for other mean of livelihood and fame eventually terminate relationship with the tribune and devote talent full time to the cause that would bequeath to the world the seed of leninism stalinism revolution and if only this capitalistic new|york newspaper have treat more kindly if only marx have remain a foreign correspondent history may have be different and hope all publisher will bear this lesson in mind the next time receive a poverty stricken appeal for a small increase in the expense account from an obscure newspaper have select as the title of remark tonight the president and the press some may suggest that this would be more naturally word the|president|versus|the|press but those be not sentiment tonight be true however that when a well know diplomat from another country demand recently that state|department repudiate certain newspaper attack on colleague be unnecessary for to reply that this administration be not responsible for the press for the press have already make clear that be not responsible for this administration nevertheless purpose here tonight be not to deliver the usual assault on the so call party press on the contrary in recent|months have rarely hear any complaint about political bias in the press except from a few republicans nor be purpose tonight to discuss or defend the televising of presidential press conference think be highly beneficial to have some|20,000,000 americans regularly sit in on these conference to observe if may say so the incisive the intelligent and the courteous quality display by washington correspondent nor finally be these remark intend to examine the proper degree of privacy which the press should allow to any president and family if in the|last|few|month white|house reporter and photographer have be attend church service with regularity that have surely do no harm on the other hand realize that staff and wire service photographer may be complain that do not enjoy the same green privilege at the local golf course which once do be true that predecessor do not object as do to picture of one 's golfing skill in action but neither on the other hand do ever bean a secret|service man topic tonight be a more sober of concern to publisher as well as editor want to talk about common responsibility in the face of a common danger the event of recent|week may have help to illuminate that challenge for some but the dimension of threat have loom large on the horizon for many|years whatever hope may be for the future for reduce this threat or live with — there be no escape either the gravity or the totality of challenge to survival and to security a challenge that confront in unaccustomed way in every sphere of human activity this deadly challenge impose upon society requirement of direct concern both to the press and to the president — requirement that may seem almost contradictory in tone but which must be reconcile and fulfil if be to meet this national peril refer first to the need for far great public information and second to the need for far great official secrecy the very word secrecy be repugnant in a free and open society and be as a people inherently and historically oppose to secret society to secret oath and to secret proceeding decide long ago that the danger of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent fact far outweigh the danger which be cite to justify even today there be little value in oppose the threat of a closed society by imitate arbitrary restriction even today there be little value in insure the survival of nation if tradition do not survive with and there be very grave danger that an announce need for increase security will be seize upon by those anxious to expand meaning to the very limit of official censorship and concealment that do not intend to permit to the extent that be in control and no official of administration whether rank be high or low civilian or military should interpret word here tonight as an excuse to censor the news to stifle dissent to cover up mistake or to withhold from the press and the public the fact deserve to know but do ask every publisher every editor and every newsman in the nation to reexamine own standard and to recognize the nature of country 's peril in time of war the government and the press have customarily join in an effort base largely on self discipline to prevent unauthorized disclosure to the enemy in time of clear and present danger the court have hold that even the privileged right of the|first|amendment must yield to the public 's need for national security today no war have be declare and however fierce the struggle may be — may never be declare in the traditional fashion way of life be under attack those who make enemy be advance around the globe the survival of friend be in danger and yet no war have be declare no border have be cross by march troop no missile have be fire if the press be await a declaration of war before impose the self discipline of combat condition then can only say that no war ever pose a great threat to security if be await a finding of clear and present danger then can only say that the danger have never be more clear and presence have never be more imminent require a change in outlook a change in tactic a change in mission by the government by the people by every businessman or labor leader and by every newspaper for be oppose around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that rely primarily on covert mean for expand sphere of influence on infiltration instead of invasion on subversion instead of election on intimidation instead of free choice on guerrilla by night instead of army by day be a system which have conscript vast human and material resource into the building of a tightly knit highly efficient machine that combine military diplomatic intelligence economic scientific and political operation preparation be conceal not publish mistake be bury not headline dissenter be silence not praise no expenditure be question no rumor be print no secret be reveal conduct in short with a war time discipline no democracy would ever hope or wish to match nevertheless every democracy recognize the necessary restraint of national security and the question remain whether those restraint need to be more strictly observe if be to oppose this kind of attack as well as outright invasion for the fact of the matter be that this nation 's foe have openly boast of acquire through newspaper information would otherwise hire agent to acquire through theft bribery or espionage that detail of this nation 's covert preparation to counter the enemy 's covert operation have be available to every newspaper reader friend and foe alike that the size the strength the location and the nature of force and weapon and plan and strategy for use have all be pinpoint in the press and other news medium to a degree sufficient to satisfy any foreign power and that in at|least|one case the publication of detail concern a secret mechanism whereby satellite be follow require alteration at the expense of considerable time and money the newspaper which print these story be loyal patriotic responsible and well meaning have be engage in open warfare undoubtedly would not have publish such item but in the absence of open warfare recognize only the test of journalism and not the test of national security and question tonight be whether additional test should not now be adopt that question be for alone to answer no public official should answer for no governmental plan should impose restraint against will but would be fail in duty to the nation in consider all of the responsibility that now bear and all of the mean at hand to meet those responsibility if do not commend this problem to attention and urge thoughtful consideration on many early occasion have say and newspaper have constantly say that these be time that appeal to every citizen 's sense of sacrifice and self discipline call out to every citizen to weigh right and comfort against obligation to the common good can not now believe that those citizen who serve in the newspaper business consider exempt from that appeal have no intention of establish a new office|of|war|information to govern the flow of news be not suggest any new form of censorship or new type of security classification have no easy answer to the dilemma that have pose and would not seek to impose if have but be ask the member of the newspaper profession and the industry in this country to reexamine own responsibility to consider the degree and the nature of the present danger and to heed the duty of self restraint which that danger impose upon all every newspaper now ask with respect to every story be news all suggest be that add the question be in the interest of the national security and hope that every group in america union and businessman and public official at every level will ask the same question of endeavor and subject action to this same exacting test and should the press of america consider and recommend the voluntary assumption of specific new step or machinery can assure that will cooperate whole heartedly with those recommendation perhaps there will be no recommendation perhaps there be no answer to the dilemma face by a free and open society in a cold and secret war in time of peace any discussion of this subject and any action that result be both painful and without precedent but this be a time of peace and peril which know no precedent in history be the unprecedented nature of this challenge that also give rise to second obligation an obligation which share and that be obligation to inform and alert the american people to make certain that possess all the fact that need and understand as well the peril the prospect the purpose of program and the choice that face no president should fear public scrutiny of program for from that scrutiny come understanding and from that understanding come

have make all citizen of the world the hope and threat of become the hope and threat of all in that world 's effort to live together the evolution of gunpowder to ultimate limit have warn mankind of the terrible consequence of failure and so be to the printing press to the recorder of man 's deed the keeper of conscience the courier of news that look for strength and assistance confident that with help man will be what be bear to be free and independent view transcript transcript mr. chairman lady and gentleman appreciate very much generous invitation to be here tonight bear heavy responsibility these|days and an article read some time ago remind of how particularly heavily the burden of present day event bear upon profession may remember that in the|new|york|herald|tribune under the sponsorship and publishing of horace|greeley employ as london correspondent an obscure journalist by the name of karl|marx be tell that foreign correspondent marx stone break and with a family ill and undernourished constantly appeal to greeley and managing editor charles|dana for an increase in munificent salary of per installment a salary which and engels ungratefully label as the lousy petty bourgeois cheating but when all financial appeal be refuse marx look around for other mean of livelihood and fame eventually terminate relationship with the tribune and devote talent full time to the cause that would bequeath to the world the seed of leninism stalinism revolution and if only this capitalistic new|york newspaper have treat more kindly if only marx have remain a foreign correspondent history may have be different and hope all publisher will bear this lesson in mind the next time receive a poverty stricken appeal for a small increase in the expense account from an obscure newspaper have select as the title of remark tonight the president and the press some may suggest that this would be more naturally word the|president|versus|the|press but those be not sentiment tonight be true however that when a well know diplomat from another country demand recently that state|department repudiate certain newspaper attack on colleague be unnecessary for to reply that this administration be not responsible for the press for the press have already make clear that be not responsible for this administration nevertheless purpose here tonight be not to deliver the usual assault on the so call party press on the contrary in recent|months have rarely hear any complaint about political bias in the press except from a few republicans nor be purpose tonight to discuss or defend the televising of presidential press conference think be highly beneficial to have some|20,000,000 americans regularly sit in on these conference to observe if may say so the incisive the intelligent and the courteous quality display by washington correspondent nor finally be these remark intend to examine the proper degree of privacy which the press should allow to any president and family if in the|last|few|month white|house reporter and photographer have be attend church service with regularity that have surely do no harm on the other hand realize that staff and wire service photographer may be complain that do not enjoy the same green privilege at the local golf course which once do be true that predecessor do not object as do to picture of one 's golfing skill in action but neither on the other hand do ever bean a secret|service man topic tonight be a more sober of concern to publisher as well as editor want to talk about common responsibility in the face of a common danger the event of recent|week may have help to illuminate that challenge for some but the dimension of threat have loom large on the horizon for many|years whatever hope may be for the future for reduce this threat or live with — there be no escape either the gravity or the totality of challenge to survival and to security a challenge that confront in unaccustomed way in every sphere of human activity this deadly challenge impose upon society requirement of direct concern both to the press and to the president — requirement that may seem almost contradictory in tone but which must be reconcile and fulfil if be to meet this national peril refer first to the need for far great public information and second to the need for far great official secrecy the very word secrecy be repugnant in a free and open society and be as a people inherently and historically oppose to secret society to secret oath and to secret proceeding decide long ago that the danger of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent fact far outweigh the danger which be cite to justify even today there be little value in oppose the threat of a closed society by imitate arbitrary restriction even today there be little value in insure the survival of nation if tradition do not survive with and there be very grave danger that an announce need for increase security will be seize upon by those anxious to expand meaning to the very limit of official censorship and concealment that do not intend to permit to the extent that be in control and no official of administration whether rank be high or low civilian or military should interpret word here tonight as an excuse to censor the news to stifle dissent to cover up mistake or to withhold from the press and the public the fact deserve to know but do ask every publisher every editor and every newsman in the nation to reexamine own standard and to recognize the nature of country 's peril in time of war the government and the press have customarily join in an effort base largely on self discipline to prevent unauthorized disclosure to the enemy in time of clear and present danger the court have hold that even the privileged right of the|first|amendment must yield to the public 's need for national security today no war have be declare and however fierce the struggle may be — may never be declare in the traditional fashion way of life be under attack those who make enemy be advance around the globe the survival of friend be in danger and yet no war have be declare no border have be cross by march troop no missile have be fire if the press be await a declaration of war before impose the self discipline of combat condition then can only say that no war ever pose a great threat to security if be await a finding of clear and present danger then can only say that the danger have never be more clear and presence have never be more imminent require a change in outlook a change in tactic a change in mission by the government by the people by every businessman or labor leader and by every newspaper for be oppose around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that rely primarily on covert mean for expand sphere of influence on infiltration instead of invasion on subversion instead of election on intimidation instead of free choice on guerrilla by night instead of army by day be a system which have conscript vast human and material resource into the building of a tightly knit highly efficient machine that combine military diplomatic intelligence economic scientific and political operation preparation be conceal not publish mistake be bury not headline dissenter be silence not praise no expenditure be question no rumor be print no secret be reveal conduct in short with a war time discipline no democracy would ever hope or wish to match nevertheless every democracy recognize the necessary restraint of national security and the question remain whether those

economic stability and stimulate economic growth economic expansion in turn create a grow tax base thus increase revenue and thereby enable to meet more readily public need as well as need as private individual this message recognize the basic soundness of tax structure but also recognize the change need and standard of economic and international position and the constructive reform need to keep tax system up to date and to maintain equity previous message have emphasize the need for prompt congressional and executive action to alleviate the deficit in international balance of payment to increase the modernization productivity and competitive status of american industry to stimulate the expansion and growth of economy to eliminate to the extent possible economic injustice within own society and to maintain the level of revenue request in predecessor 's budget in each of these endeavor tax policy have an important role to play and necessary tax change be herein propose the elimination of certain defect and inequity as propose below will provide revenue gain to offset the tax reduction offer to stimulate the economy thus no net loss of revenue be involve in this set of proposal wish to emphasize here that be a that consideration of both revenue and equity as well as the interrelationship of many of the proposal urge consideration as a unit be instruct the secretary of the treasury to furnish the|committee|on|ways|and|means|of the house a detailed explanation of these proposal in connection with legislative consideration i. long range tax reform while be essential that the congress receive at this time this administration 's proposal for urgent and obvious tax adjustment need to fulfill the aim list above time have not permit the comprehensive review necessary for a tax structure which be so complicated and so critically important to so many people this message be but a first though urgent step along the road to constructive reform be direct the secretary of the treasury build on recent tax study of the congress to undertake the research and preparation of a comprehensive tax reform program to be place before the next session of the congress progress from these study particularly those of the|committee|on|ways|and|mean and the|joint|economic|committee the program should be aim at provide a broad and more uniform tax base together with an appropriate rate structure can thereby work toward the goal of a high rate of economic growth a more equitable tax structure and a simple tax law know these objective be share by and at this particular time of year acutely desire by the vast majority of the american people in meet the demand of war finance the individual income tax move from a selective tax impose on the wealthy to the mean by which the great majority of citizen participate in pay for well over half of total budget receipt be supplement by the corporation income tax which provide for another|quarter of the total this emphasis on income taxation have be a sound development but so many taxpayer have become so preoccupied with so many tax save device that business decision be interfere with and the efficient functioning of the price system be distort moreover special provision have develop into an increase source of preferential treatment to various group whenever taxpayer be permit to pay less someone else must be ask to pay more the uniform distribution of the tax burden be thereby disturb and high rate be make necessary by the narrowing of the tax base of course some departure from uniformity be need to promote desirable social or economic objective of override importance which can be achieve most effectively through the tax mechanism but many of the preference which have develop do not meet such a test and need to be reevaluate in tax reform program will be a major aim of tax reform program to reverse this process by broaden the tax base and reconsider the rate structure the result should be a tax system that be more equitable more efficient and more conducive to economic growth ii tax incentive for modernization and expansion the history of economy have be of rise productivity base on improvement in skill advance in technology and a grow supply of more efficient tool and equipment this rise have be reflect in rise wage and standard of live for worker as well as a healthy rate of growth for the economy as a whole have also be the foundation of leadership in world market even as enjoy the high wage rate in the world today as face serious pressure on balance of payment position must give special attention to the modernization of plant and equipment force to reconstruct after wartime devastation friend abroad now possess a modern industrial system help to make formidable competitor in world market if own good be to compete with foreign good in price and quality both at home and abroad shall need the most efficient plant and equipment at the same time to meet the need of a grow population and labor force and to achieve a rising per capita income and employment level need a high and rise level of both private and public capital formation in precede message have propose program to meet some of need for such capital formation in the public area include investment in intangible capital such as education and research as well as investment in physical capital such as building and highway be now propose additional incentive for the modernization and expansion of private plant and equipment inevitably capital expansion and modernization now frequently under the name of automation alter establish mode of production great benefit result and be distribute widely but some hardship result as well this place heavy responsibility on public policy not to retard modernization and capital expansion but to promote growth and ameliorate hardship when do occur to maintain a high level of demand and employment so that those who be displace will be reabsorb quickly into new position and to assist in retrain and find new job for such displace worker be develop through such measure as the|area|redevelopment|bill and a strengthened employment|service as well as assistance to the unemployed the program design to achieve these objective high capital formation can be sustain only by a high and rise level of demand for good and service indeed the investment incentive can contribute materially to achieve the prosperous economy under which this incentive will make maximum contribution to economic growth rather than delay adoption until all excess capacity have disappear and unemployment be low should take this step now to strengthen anti - recession program stimulate employment and increase export market additional expenditure on plant and equipment will immediately create more job in the construction lumber steel cement machinery and other related capital good industry the staffing of these new plant and fill the order for new export market will require additional employee the additional wage of these worker will help create still more job in consumer good and service industry the increase in job result from a|full|year 's operation of such an incentive be estimate at about|half|a|million specifically therefore recommend enactment of an investment tax incentive in the form of a tax credit of % of all new plant and equipment investment expenditure in excess of current depreciation allowance --6 % of such expenditure below this level but in excess of % of depreciation allowance with % on the first of new investment as a minimum credit this credit would be take as an offset against the firm 's tax liability up to an overall limitation of % in the reduction of that liability in any|one|year would be separate from and in addition to depreciation of the eligible new investment at cost would be available to individually own business as well as corporate enterprise and apply to eligible investment expenditure make after january|1|of|this|year to remain a real incentive and make a maximum contribution to those area of capital expansion and modernization where be most need and to permit efficient administration eligible investment expenditure would be limit to expenditure on new plant and equipment on asset locate in .the united|stat and on asset with a life of six|years|or|more investment by public utility other than transportation would be exclude as would be investment in residential construction include apartment and hotel of the eligible firm be expect that many small firm would be able to take advantage of the minimum credit of % on the first of new investment which be design to provide a helpful stimulus to the many small business in need of modernization other small firm subject to a % tax rate would strive to be eligible for the full % credit the equivalent for such firm of a deduction from gross income for tax purpose of % of the cost of new investment among the remain firm be expect that a majority would be induce to make new investment in modern plant and equipment in excess of depreciation in order to earn the % credit new and grow firm would be particularly benefit the % credit for those whose new investment expenditure fall between|50%|and|100 % of depreciation allowance be design to afford some substantial incentive to the depressed or hesitant firm which know can not yet achieve the % credit in arrive at this form of tax encouragement to investment careful consideration be give to other alternative if the credit be give across the board to all new investment a much large revenue loss would result from those expenditure which would have be undertake anyway or represent no new level of effort objective be to provide the large possible inducement to new investment which would not otherwise be undertake thus the plan recommend above would involve the same revenue loss approximately|$1.7|billion as only a credit across the board to all new investment the use of current depreciation allowance as the threshold above which the high rate of credit would apply recommend for a number of reason depreciation reflect the average level of investment over the past but be a less restrictive and more stable test than the use of an average of investment expenditure for a period such as the precede five|years in addition the depreciation allowance in effect supply tax free fund for investment up to this level now propose a tax credit which would help to secure fund need for the additional investment beyond that level the propose credit in term of the revenue loss involve will also be much more effective as an inducement to investment than an outright reduction in the rate of corporation income tax benefit would be distribute more broadly since the propose credit will apply to individual and partnership as well as corporation will also be more effective as a direct incentive to corporate investment and increase available fund more specifically in those corporation most likely to use for additional investment in short whereas the credit will have the advantage of focus on the profitability of new investment much of the revenue loss under a general corporate rate reduction would be divert into raise the profitability of old investment be true that this advantage of focus entirely on new investment be share by the alternative strongly urge by some a tax change permit more rapid depreciation of new asset be accelerate depreciation or an additional depreciation allowance for the|first|year but the propose investment credit would be superior in view for a number of reason in the first place the determination of the length of an asset 's life and proper method of depreciation have a normal and important function in determine taxable income wholly apart from any consideration of incentive and should not be alter or manipulate for other purpose that would interfere with this function may be that on examination some of the exist depreciation rule will be find to be outmode and inequitable but that be a question that should be separate from investment incentive a review of these rule and method be underway in the|treasury|department as a part of overall tax reform study to determine whether change be appropriate and if so what form should take adoption of the propose incentive credit would in no way foreclose late action on these aspect of depreciation in the second place an increase in tax depreciation tend to be record in the firm 's account thereby raise current cost and act as a deterrent to price reduction the propose investment credit would not share this defect finally be clear that the tax credit would be more effective in induce new investment for the same revenue loss the entire credit would be reflect immediately in the increase fund available for investment without increase the company 's future tax liability a speed up in depreciation only postpone the timing of the tax liability on profit from the investment to a later date an increase in profitability not comparable to that of an outright tax credit yet accelerate depreciation be much more costly in immediate revenue for example on an average investment a tax credit of % would bring the same return to the firm as an|additional|first|year depreciation of over|50 % of the cost of the investment yet the immediate revenue loss to the treasury from such additional depreciation would be twice as much and would remain considerably high for many|years the incentive to new investment economy need and which this recommendation would provide at a revenue loss of could be supply by an initial write off only at an immediate cost of believe this investment tax credit will become a useful and continuous part of tax structure but will be a new venture and remain in need of review moreover may prove desirable for the congress to modify the credit from time to time so as to adapt to the need of a change economy strongly urge adoption in this session tax treatment of foreign income change economic condition at home and abroad the desire to achieve great equity in taxation and the strain which have develop in balance of payment position in the|last|few|year compel to examine critically certain feature of tax system which in conjunction with the tax system of other country consistently favor united|stat private investment abroad compare with investment in own economy elimination of tax deferral privilege in develop country and tax haven deferral privilege in all country profit earn abroad by american firm operate through foreign subsidiary be under present tax law subject to united|stat tax only when be return to the parent company in the form of dividend in some case this tax deferral have make possible indefinite postponement of tax and in those country where income taxis be low than in the|united|state the ability to defer the payment of u.s. tax by retain income in the subsidiary company provide a tax advantage for company operate through overseas subsidiary that be not available to company operate solely in the|united|state many american investor properly make use of this deferral in the conduct of foreign investment though change condition now make continuance of the privilege undesirable such change of policy imply no criticism of the investor who so utilize this privilege the undesirability of continue deferral be underscored where deferral have serve as a shelter for tax escape through the unjustifiable use of tax haven such as switzerland recently more and more enterprise organize abroad by american firm have arrange corporate structure aid by artificial arrangement between parent and subsidiary regard intercompany pricing the transfer of patent licensing right the shifting of management fee and similar practice which maximize the accumulation of profit in the tax haven so as to exploit the multiplicity of foreign tax system and international agreement in order to reduce sharply or eliminate completely tax liability both at home and abroad to the extent that these tax haven and other tax deferral privilege result in u.s. firm invest or locate abroad largely for tax reason the efficient allocation of international resource be upset the initial drain on already adverse balance of payment be never fully compensate and profit be retain and reinveste abroad which would otherwise be invest in the|united|state certainly since the postwar reconstruction of europe and japan have be complete there be no longer foreign policy reason for provide tax incentive for foreign investment in the economically advanced country if be seek to curb tax haven if recognize that the stimulus of tax deferral be no longer need for investment in the develop country and if be to emphasize investment in this country in order to stimulate economy and plant modernization as well as ease balance of payment deficit can no longer afford exist tax treatment of foreign income therefore recommend that legislation be adopt which would after a step transitional period tax each year american corporation on current share of the undistributed profit realize in that|year by subsidiary corporation organize in economically advanced country this current taxation would also apply to individual shareholder of closely hold corporation in those country since income taxis pay abroad be properly a credit against income tax this would subject the income from such business activity to essentially the same tax rate as business activity conduct in the|united|state to permit firm to adjust operation to this change also recommend that this result be achieve in equal step over a year period under which only|one half of the profit would be affect during where the foreign taxis pay have be close to the u.s. rate the impact of this change would be small this proposal will maintain united|stat investment in the develop country at the level justify by market force american enterprise abroad will continue to compete with foreign firm with access to capital market at home and abroad advanced technical know how energy resourcefulness and many other advantage american firm will continue to occupy rightful place in the market of the world while the rate of expansion of some american business operation abroad may be reduce through the withdrawal of tax deferral such reduction would be consistent with the efficient distribution of capital resource in the world balance of payment need and fairness to compete firm locate in own country at the same time recommend that tax deferral be continue for income from investment in the develop economy the free world have a strong obligation to assist in the development of these economy and private investment have an important contribution to make continue income tax deferral for these area will be helpful in this respect in addition the propose elimination of income tax deferral on united|stat earning in industrialize country should enhance the relative attraction of investment in the less developed country on the other hand recommend elimination of the tax haven device anywhere in the world even in the underdeveloped country through the elimination of tax deferral privilege for those form of activity such as trading licensing insurance and other that typically seek out tax haven method of operation there be no valid reason to permit remain untaxed regardless of the country in which be locate taxation of foreign investment companies for some|year now have witness substantial outflow of capital from the|united|state into investment company create abroad whose principal justification lie in the tax benefit which method of operation produce recommend that these tax benefit be remove and that income derive through such foreign investment company be treat in substantially the same way as income from domestic investment company taxation of american citizens abroad be no more justifiable to provide tax exemption for individual live in the develop country than be to provide tax inducement for capital investment there nor should permit totally unjustified tax benefit to be obtain by those americans whose choice of residence be dictate primarily by desire to minimize taxis therefore recommend the total tax exemption now accord the earned income of american citizen reside abroad be completely terminate for those reside in economically advanced country this exemption for earned income be limit to for those reside in the less developed country and the exemption of of earn income now accord those citizen who stay but do not reside abroad for out of also be completely terminate for those live or travel in the economically advanced country estate|tax|on|property|located|abroad recommend that the exclusion from the estate tax accord real property situate abroad be terminate with the adoption of the credit for foreign taxis under the estate tax there be no justification for the continue exemption of such property allowance for foreign|tax|on|dividends finally the method by which the credit for foreign income taxis be compute in the case of dividend involve a double allowance for foreign income taxis and should be correct these proposal along with more detailed and technical change need to improve the taxation of foreign income be expect to reduce substantially balance of payment deficit and to increase revenue by at|least|$250|million per year iv correction of other structural defect next recommend a number of measure to remove other serious defect in the income tax structure these change while make a beginning toward the comprehensive tax reform program mention above will provide sufficient revenue gain to offset the cost of the investment tax credit and keep the revenue produce potential of tax structure intact withhold on interest and dividends system of combined withholding and voluntary reporting on wage and salary under the individual income tax have serve well introduce during the war when the income tax be extend to million of new taxpayer the wage withholding system have be of the most important and successful advance in tax system in recent time initial difficulty be quickly overcome and the new system help the taxpayer no less than the tax collector be the more unfortunate therefore that the application of the withholding principle have remain incomplete withholding do not apply to dividend and interest with the result that substantial amount of such income particularly interest improperly escape taxation be estimate that about|$3|billion of taxable interest and dividend be unreported each|year this be patently unfair to those who must as a result bear a large share of the tax burden re - cipient of dividend and interest should pay tax no less than those who receive wage and salary income and the tax should be pay just as promptly large continued avoidance of tax on the part of some have a steadily demoralize effect on the compliance of other this gap in reporting have not be appreciably lessen by educational program nor can be effectively close by intensify enforcement measure except by the expenditure of inordinate amount of time and money withhold on corporate dividend and on investment type interest such as interest pay on taxable government and corporate security and saving account be both necessary and practicable therefore recommend the enactment of legislation to provide for a % withholding rate on corporate dividend and taxable investment type interest effective january|1,|1962 under a system which would not require the preparation of withholding statement to be send to recipient would thus place a relatively light burden of compliance on the payer of interest and dividend certainly less than that place on payer of wage and salary while at the same time largely solve the compliance problem for most of the taxpayer receive dividend and interest step will also be take to avoid hardship for recipient who be not subject to tax the remain need for compliance largely in the high income group subject to a high tax rate would be meet through the concentration of enforcement device on taxpayer in these bracket introduction of equipment for the automatic processing of information return would be especially helpful for this purpose and would thus supplement the extension of withholding enactment of this proposal be estimate to increase revenue by per year repeal of the|dividend|credit|and|exclusion the present law provide for an exclusion from income of the first of dividend receive from domestic corporation and for a % credit against tax of such dividend income in excess of these provision be enact in proponent argue that would encourage capital formation through equity investment and that would provide a partial offset to the so call double taxation of dividend income be now clear that serve neither purpose well and therefore recommend the repeal of both the dividend credit and exclusion the dividend credit and exclusion be not an efficient stimulus to capital expansion in the form of plant and equipment the revenue loss result from these provision be spread over a large volume of outstanding share rather than be concentrate on new share and the stimulate effect of the provision be thus greatly dilute result in relatively little increase in the supply of equity fund and a relatively slight reduction in the cost of equity financing in fact such reduction as do occur be more likely to benefit large corporation with easy access to the capital market while be of little use to small firm which be not so favorably situated insofar as raise the profitability of new investment in plant and equipment be concern the tax investment credit propose above would be far more effective since be offer to the corporation where the actual investment decision be make the dividend credit and exclusion be equally inadequate as a solution to the so call problem of double taxation whatever may be the merit of the argument respect the existence of double taxation the provision of the act clearly do not offer an appropriate remedy greatly overcompensate the dividend recipient in the high income bracket while give either insufficient or no relief to shareholder with small income this point deserve emphasis for view simply as a means of tax reduction the dividend credit be wholly inequitable the distribution of benefit be highly favorable to the taxpayer in the upper income group who receive the major part of dividend income only|about|10|percent of dividend income accrue to those with income below about|80|percent of accrue to that % of taxpayer whose income exceed a year similarly dividend income be a sharply rise fraction of total income as move up the income scale thus dividend income be about|1|percent of all income from all source for those taxpayer with income of but constitute more|than|25|percent of the income for those with of income and about|50|percent for those with income over the role of the dividend credit should not be confuse with the broad question of tax rate applicable to high income these high rate deserve re - examination and this be of the problem which will be examine in the context of next|year 's tax reform but if top bracket rate be to be reduce the dividend credit be not the way to do rate reduction if appropriate should apply no less to those with high income from other source such as professional and salaried people whose tax position be particularly difficult today if the credit be eliminate the exclusion should also be discard for similar reason the tax saving from the exclusion be substantially great for a dividend recipient with a high income than for a recipient with low income moreover on equity ground there be no reason for give tax reduction to that small fraction of low income tax payer who receive dividend in contrast to those who must live on wage interest rent or other form of income the formula therefore be a dead end and should be rescind effective december|31|of|this|year the estimated revenue gain be per year expense accounts in recent|years widespread abuse have develop through the use of the expense account too many firm and individual have devise mean of deduct too many personal living expense as business expense thereby charge a large part of cost to indeed expense account living have become a byword in the american scene this be a matter of national concern affect not only public revenue sense of fairness and respect for the tax system but moral and business practice as well this widespread distortion of business and social structure be largely a creature of the tax system and the time have come when tax law should cease encouragement of luxury spending as a charge on the federal treasury the slogan--"it 's deductible"--should pass from scene tight enforcement of present legislation will not suffice even though in some instance entertainment and related expense have an association with the need of business nevertheless confer substantial tax free personal benefit to the recipient in other case deduction be obtain by disguise personal expense as business outlay but under present law be extremely difficult to separate out and disallow such pseudo business expenditure new legislation be need to deal with the problem therefore recommend that the cost of such business entertainment and the maintenance of entertainment facility such as yacht and hunting lodge be disallow in full as a tax deduction and that restriction be impose on the deductibility of business gift expense of business trip combine with vacation and excessive personal living expense incur on business travel away from home feel confident that these measure will be welcome by the american people be also confident that business firm now force to emulate the expense account favor of competitor however unsound or uneconomical such practice may be will welcome the removal of this pressure these measure will strengthen both tax structure and the moral fibre of society these provision should be effective as of january|1,|1962 and be estimate to increase treasury receipt by at|least|$250|million per year capital|gain on sale of depreciable business property another flaw which should be correct at this time relate to the taxation of gain on the sale of depreciable business property such gain be now tax at the preferential rate applicable to capital gain even though represent ordinary income this situation arise because the statutory rate of depreciation may not coincide with the actual decline in the value of the asset while the taxpayer hold the property depreciation be take as a deduction from ordinary income upon resale where the amount of depreciation allowable exceed the decline in the actual value of the asset so that a gain occur this gain under present law be tax at the preferential capital gain rate the advantage result from this practice have be increase by the liberalization of depreciation rate capital gain concept should not encompass this kind of income this inequity should be eliminate and especially so in view of the propose investment credit should not encourage through tax incentive the further acquisition of such property as long as this loophole remain therefore recommend that capital gain treatment be withdraw from gain on the disposition of depreciable property both personal and real property to the extent that depreciation have be deduct for such property by the seller in previous|years permit only the excess of the sale price over the original cost to be treat as a capital gain the remainder should be treat as ordinary income this reform should immediately become effective as to all sale take place after the date of enactment be estimate to raise revenue by annually cooperatives|and|financial|institutions another area of the tax law which call for attention be the treatment of cooperative private lending institution and fire and casualty insurance company contrary to the intention of congress substantial income from certain cooperative enterprise reflect business operation be not be tax either to the cooperative organization or member this situation must be correct in a manner that be fair and just to both the cooperative and compete business the present inequity have result from court decision which hold patronage refund in certain form to be non - taxable recommend that the law be clarify so that all earning be taxable to either the cooperative or to patron assess the patron on the earning that be allocate to as patronage dividend or refund in scrip or cash the withholding principle recommend above should also be apply to patronage dividend or refund so that the average patron receive scrip will in effect be give the cash to pay tax on patronage dividend or refund the cooperative should not be penalize by the assessment of a patronage tax upon dividend or refund taxable to the patron but leave in the business as a substitute for the sale of security to obtain additional equity capital the exemption for rural electric cooperative and credit union should be continue the tax provision applicable to fire and casualty insurance company originally adopt in need to be review in the light of current condition many of these company organize on the mutual or reciprocal basis be now tax under a special formula which do not take account of underwriting gain and thus result in an inequitable distribution of the tax burden among various type of company consideration should be give to tax mutual or reciprocal company on a basis similar to stock company follow the pattern of similar treatment of stock and mutual enterprise in the life insurance field some of the most important type of private saving and lending institution in the country be accord tax deductible reserve provision which substantially reduce or eliminate federal income tax liability these provision should be review with the aim of assure non - discriminatory treatment remedial legislation in these field would enlarge the revenue and contribute to a fair and sound tax structure v. tax administration of the major characteristic of tax system and in which can take a great deal of pride be that operate primarily through individual self assessment the integrity of such a system depend upon the continued willingness of the people honestly and accurately to discharge this annual price of citizenship to the extent that some people be dishonest or careless in dealing with the government the majority be force to carry a heavy tax burden for voluntary serf assessment to be both meaningful and productive of revenue the citizen must not only have confidence in the fairness of the tax law but also in uniform and vigorous enforcement of these law if non - compliance by the few continue unchecked the confidence of the many in self assessment system will be shake and of the cornerstone of government weaken have in this message already recommend the application of withholding to dividend and interest and revision to halt the abuse of expense account these measure will improve taxpayer compliance and raise the regard of taxpayer for the fairness of system in addition propose further measure to improve the tax enforcement machinery taxpayer|account|number the|internal|revenue|service have begin the installation of automatic datum processing equipment to improve administration of the grow job of tax collection and enforcement a system of identify taxpayer account number which would make possible the bringing together of all tax datum for any particular taxpayer be an essential part of such an improve collection and enforcement program for this purpose social security number would be use by taxpayer already have the small minority currently without such number would be assign number which these person could later use as well for social security purpose if need the number would be enter on tax return information return and relate document recommend that legislation be enact to authorize the use of taxpayer account number begin january|1,|1962 to identify taxpayer account throughout the processing and record keeping operation of the|internal|revenue|service increased|audit|coverage the examination of tax return be the essence of the enforcement process the number of examine personnel of the|internal|revenue|service however have be consistently inadequate to cope with the audit workload consequently have be unable to audit carefully many of the return which should be so examine anticipate growth in population will of course increase this enforcement problem relate to broadened tax audit be the criminal enforcement program of the|revenue|service here the guide principle be the creation of a deterrent to tax evasion and to maintain or if possible increase voluntary compliance with all tax statute this mean place an appropriate degree of investigative emphasis on all type of tax violation in all geographical area and identify violation of substance in all income bracket regardless of occupation business or profession within this framework of a balanced enforcement effort the service be place special investigative emphasis on return file by person receive income from illegal source have direct all federal law enforcement agency to cooperate fully with the attorney general in a drive against organize crime and to utilize resource to the maximum extent in conduct investigation of individual engage in criminal activity on a major scale with the foregoing in mind have direct the secretary of the treasury to provide through the|internal|revenue|service a maximum effort in this field to fulfill these requirement for improved audits enforcement and anti - crime investigation be essential that the service be provide additional resource which will pay own cost many time over in further the service 's long range plan the prior administration ask additional appropriation of to hire about|3,500 additional personnel during fiscal|1962 include provision for the necessary increase in space and modern equipment vital to the efficient operation of the service to meet the commitment describe above this administration review these proposal and recommend that be increase by another and additional personnel to expedite the expansion and criminal enforcement program the pende alternative of only|1,995 additional personnel or half of the number request this administration would constitute little more than the additional employee need each|year during the be just to keep up with the estimate growth in number and complexity of return file thus must again strongly urge the congress to give full support to original request these increase will safeguard the long term adequacy of the nation 's traditional voluntary compliance system and at the same time return the add appropriation several time over in add revenue inventory|report be increasingly apparent that the manipulation of inventory have become a frequent method of avoid taxis current law and regulation generally permit the use of inventory method which be acceptable in recognize accounting practice deviation from these method which be not always easy to detect during examination of tax return can often lead to complete non - payment of taxis until the inventory be liquidate and for some taxpayer this represent permanent tax reduction the understating of the valuation of inventory be the device most fiequently use have direct the|internal|revenue|service to give increase attention to this area of tax avoidance through a step up emphasis on both the verification of the amount report as inventory and an examination of method use in arrive at report valuation vi tax rate extension as recommend by predecessor be again necessary that congress enact an extension of present corporation income and excise tax rate otherwise schedule for reduction or termination on july|1,|1961 such extension have be adopt by the congress on a number of previous occasion and present revenue requirement make such extension absolutely necessary again this|year in the absence of such legislation the corporate tax rate would be decrease percentage point from to excise tax rate on distilled spirit beer wine cigarette passenger automobile automobile part and accessory and the transportation of person would also decline and the excise tax on general telephone service would expire can not afford the loss of these revenue at this time vii aviation fuel the last item on the agenda relate to aviation fuel the previous administration have urge that civil aviation a mature and grow industry be require to pay a fair share of the cost of operate and improve the federal airway system the rapidly mount cost of these essential service to air transportation make the imposition of user charge more imperative now than ever before the most efficient method for recover a portion of these cost equitably from the airway user be through a tax on aviation fuel present law provide for a net tax of a gallon on aviation gasoline but no tax on jet fuel the freedom from tax of jet fuel be inequitable and be result in substantial revenue loss due to the transition to jet power and the result decline in gasoline consumption predecessor recommend a flat tax for both aviation gasoline and jet fuel such a request however appear to be unrealistic in view of the current financial condition of the airline industry therefore recommend the present net rate on aviation gasoline to jet fuel this uniform rate cover both type of fuel at the level for fiscal|1962 and for annual increment in this rate of 1/2|cent after fiscal|year|1962 until the portion of the cost of the airway properly allocable to civil aviation be substantially recover by this tax the immediate increase in revenue from this proposal be modest in comparison with anticipate airway cost and the annual gradation of further increase be intend to moderate the impact of the tax on the air carrier industry should future economic or other development warrant a more rapid increase in the fuel tax will be recommend the decline from the revenue estimate by predecessor be not large and will be meet by the reform previously propose repeat early recommendation that consistent with the user charge principle revenue from the aviation fuel tax be retain in the general fund rather than divert to the highway trust fund conclusion the legislation recommend in this message offer a first step toward the broad objective of tax reform the immediate need be for encourage economic growth through modernization and capital expansion and to remove tax preference for foreign investment which be no longer need and which impair balance of payment position a beginning be make also toward remove some of the more glaring defect in the tax structure the revenue gain in these proposal will offset the revenue cost of the investment credit finally certain rate extension be need to maintain the revenue potential of fiscal system these item need to be do now but be a first step only will be follow next|year by a second set of proposal aim at thorough income tax reform purpose will be to broaden and unify the income tax base and to review the entire rate structure in the light of these revision let join in solve these immediate problem in the|coming|months and then join in further action to strengthen the foundation of revenue system & nbsp view transcript transcript mr. catledge member of the|american|society|of|newspaper|editor lady and gentleman the president of a great democracy such as our and the editor of great newspaper such as owe a common obligation to the people an obligation to present the fact to present with candor and to present in perspective be with that obligation in mind that have decide in the|last|24|hours to discuss briefly at this time the recent event in cuba on that unhappy island as in so many other arena of the contest for freedom the news have grow bad instead of well have emphasize before that this be a struggle of cuban patriot against a cuban dictator while could not be expect to hide sympathy make repeatedly clear that the armed force of this country would not intervene in any way any unilateral american intervention in the absence of an external attack upon or an ally would have be contrary to tradition and to international obligation but let the record show that restraint be not inexhaustible should ever appear that the inter - american doctrine of non - interference merely conceal or excuse a policy of nonaction if the nation of this hemisphere should fail to meet commitment against outside communist penetration then want clearly understand that this government will not hesitate in meet primary obligation which be to the security of nation should that time ever come do not intend to be lecture on intervention by those whose character be stamp for all time on the bloody street of budapest nor would expect or accept the same outcome which this small band of gallant cuban refugee must have know that be chance determine as be against heavy odd to pursue courageous attempt to regain island 's freedom but cuba be not an island unto and concern be not end by mere expression of nonintervention or regret this be not the first time in either ancient or recent history that a small band of freedom fighter have engage the armor of totalitarianism be not the first time that communist tank have roll over gallant man and woman fight to redeem the independence of homeland nor be by any mean the final episode in the eternal struggle of liberty against tyranny anywhere on the face of the globe include cuba mr. castro have say that these be mercenary accord to press report the final message to be relay from the refugee force on the beach come from the rebel commander when ask if wish to be evacuate answer be will never leave this country that be not the reply of a mercenary have go now to join in the mountain countless other guerrilla fighter who be equally determined that the dedication of those who give life shall not be forget and that cuba must not be abandon to the communists and do not intend to abandon either the cuban people have not yet speak final piece and have no doubt that and revolutionary|council lead by dr. cardona and member of the family of the|revolutionary|council be inform by the doctor yesterday be involve in the islands will continue to speak up for a free and independent cuba meanwhile will not accept mr. castro 's attempt to blame this nation for the hatred which onetime supporter now regard repression but there be from this sobering episode useful lesson for all to learn some may be still obscure and await further information some be clear today first be clear that the force of communism be not to be underestimate in cuba or anywhere else in the world the advantage of a police state use of mass terror and arrest to prevent the spread of free dissent cannot be overlook by those who expect the fall of every fanatic tyrant if the self discipline of the free can not match the iron discipline of the mail fist in economic political scientific and all the other kind of struggle as well as the military then the peril to freedom will continue to rise secondly be clear that this nation in concert with all the free nation of this hemisphere must take an ever close and more realistic look at the menace of external communist intervention and domination in cuba the american people be not complacent about iron|curtain tank and plane less|than|90|mile from shore but a nation of cuba 's size be less a threat to survival than be a base for subvert the survival of other free nation throughout the hemisphere be not primarily interest or security but which be now today in the great peril be for sake as well as own that must show will the evidence be clear and the hour be late and latin friend will have to face the fact that can not postpone any longer the real issue of survival of freedom in this hemisphere on that issue unlike perhaps some other there can be no middle ground together must build a hemisphere where freedom can flourish and where any free nation under outside attack of any kind can be assure that all of resource stand ready to respond to any request for assistance third and finally be clear than ever that face a relentless struggle in every corner of the globe that go far beyond the clash of army or even nuclear armament the army be there and in large number the nuclear armament be there but serve primarily as the shield behind which subversion infiltration and a host of other tactic steadily advance pick off vulnerable area by in situation which do not permit own armed intervention power be the hallmark of this offensive power and discipline and deceit the legitimate discontent of yearn people be exploit the legitimate trapping of self determination be employ but once in power all talk of discontent be repress all self determination disappear and the promise of a revolution of hope be betray as in cuba into a reign of terror those who on instruction stage automatic riot in the street of free nation over the effort of a small group of young cubans to regain freedom should recall the long roll call of refugee who can not now go back to hungary to north|korea to north|viet nam to east|germany or to poland or to any of the other land from which a steady stream of refugee pour forth in eloquent testimony to the cruel oppression now hold sway in homeland dare not fail to see the insidious nature of this new and deep struggle dare not fail to grasp the new concept the new tool the new sense of urgency will need to combat whether in cuba or south|viet nam and dare not fail to realize that this struggle be take place every|day without fanfare in thousand of village and market day and night and in classroom all over the globe the message of cuba of laos of the rise din of communist voice in asia and these message be all the same the complacent the self indulgent the soft society be about to be sweep away with the debris of history only the strong only the industrious only the determine only the courageous only the visionary who determine the real nature of struggle can possibly survive no great task face this country or this administration no other challenge be more deserving of every effort and energy too long have fix eye on traditional military need on army prepare to cross border on missile poise for flight now should be clear that this be no longer enough that security may be lose piece by piece country by country without the firing of a single missile or the crossing of a single border intend to profit from this lesson intend to reexamine and reorient force of all kind tactic and institution here in this community intend to intensify effort for a struggle in many way more difficult than war where disappointment will often accompany for be convinced that in this country and in the free world possess the necessary resource and the skill and the add strength that come from a belief in the freedom of man and be equally convinced that history will record the fact that this bitter struggle reach climax in the late 's and the early 's let then make clear as the president of the|united|state that be determine upon system 's survival and success regardless of the cost and regardless of the peril view transcript transcript be a great pleasure for mrs. kennedy and for for the vice president and mrs. johnson and for the members of congress to welcome the|ambassadorial|corps|of|our|hemisphere long time friend to the|white|house today

mission be not yet complete for unfulfilled task be to demonstrate to the entire world that man 's unsatisfied aspiration for economic progress and social justice can best be achieve by free man work within a framework of democratic institution if can do this in own hemisphere and for own people may yet realize the prophecy of the great mexican patriot benito|juarez that democracy be the destiny of future humanity as a citizen of the|united|state let be the first to admit that north|americans have not always grasp the significance of this common mission just as be also true that many in own country have not fully understand the urgency of the need to lift people from poverty and ignorance and despair but must turn from these mistake from the failure and the misunderstanding of the past to a future full of peril but bright with hope throughout latin|america a continent rich in resource and in the spiritual and cultural achievement of people million of man and woman suffer the daily degradation of poverty and hunger lack decent shelter or protection from disease child be deprive of the education or the job which be the gateway to a well life and each|day the problem grow more

alone can mobilize resource enlist the energy of people and modify social pattern so that all and not just a privileged few share in the fruit of growth if this effort be make then outside assistance will give vital impetus to progress without no amount of help will advance the welfare of the people thus if the country of latin|america be ready to do part and be sure be then believe the|united|state for part should help provide resource of a scope and magnitude sufficient to make this bold development plan a success just as help to provide against equal odd nearly the resource adequate to help rebuild the economy of western|europe for only an effort of tower dimension can ensure fulfillment of plan for a|decade of progress secondly will shortly request a ministerial meeting

outcome of those decision speak today in an hour of national peril and national opportunity before term have end shall have to test anew whether a nation organize and govern such as can endure the outcome be by no mean certain the answer be by no mean clear all of together this administration this congress this nation must forge those answer but today be to offer after little|more|than|a|week in office detailed legislation to remedy every national ill the congress would rightly wonder whether the desire for speed have replace the duty of responsibility remark therefore will be limit but will also be candid to state the fact frankly be not to despair the future nor indict the past the prudent heir take careful inventory of legacy and give a faithful accounting to those whom owe an obligation of trust and while the occasion do not call for another recital of blessing and asset do have no great asset than the willingness of a free and determined people through elect official to face all problem frankly and meet all danger free from panic or fear the present state of economy be disturb take office in the wake of seven|month of recession and half year of slack seven|year of diminished economic growth and nine|year of fall farm income business bankruptcy have reach high level since the|great|depression since farm income have be squeeze down by save for a brief period in

of national industrial capacity be never restore in short the american economy be in trouble the most resourceful industrialize country on earth rank among the last in the rate of economic growth since last|spre economic growth rate have actually recede business investment be in a decline profit have fall below predict level construction be off a|million unsold automobile be in inventory few people be work and the average work week have shrink well below 40|hour yet price have continue to rise so that now too many americans have less to spend for item that cost more to buy economic prophecy be at good an uncertain art as demonstrate by the prediction one|year|ago from this same podium that would be and quote the most prosperous year in history nevertheless forecast of continue slack and only slightly reduce unemployment through and have be make with alarming unanimity and this administration do not intend to stand helplessly by can not afford to waste idle|hours and empty plant while await the end of the recession must show the world what a free economy can do to reduce unemployment to put unused capacity to work to spur new productivity and to foster high economic growth within a range of sound fiscal policy and relative price stability will propose to the congress within the|next|14|days measure to improve unemployment compensation through temporary increase in duration on a self support basis to provide more food for the family of the unemployed and to aid needy child to redevelop area of chronic labor surplus to expand the service of the|u.s.|employment|offices to stimulate housing and construction to secure more purchasing power for low pay worker by raise and expand the minimum wage to offer tax incentive for sound plant investment to increase the development of natural resource to encourage price stability and to take other step aim at insure a prompt recovery and pave the way for increase long range growth this be not a partisan program concentrating on weakness be hope a national program to realize national strength efficient expansion at home stimulate the new plant and technology that can make good more competitive be also the key to the international balance of payment problem lay aside all alarmist talk and panicky solution let put that knotty problem in proper perspective be true that since the gap between the dollar spend or invest abroad and the dollar return to have substantially widen this overall deficit in balance of payment increase by nearly|$11|billion in and holder of dollar abroad convert to gold in such a quantity as to cause a total outflow of nearly|$5|billion of gold from reserve the deficit be cause in large part by the failure of export to penetrate foreign market the result both of restriction on good and own uncompetitive price the deficit on the other hand be more the result of an increase in private capital outflow seek new opportunity high return or speculative advantage abroad meanwhile this country have continue to bear more than share of the west 's military and foreign aid obligation under exist policy another deficit of be predict for individual in those country whose dollar position once depend on these deficit for improvement now wonder aloud whether gold reserve will remain sufficient to meet own obligation all this be cause for concern but be not cause for panic for monetary and financial position remain exceedingly strong include draw right in the|international|monetary|fund and the gold reserve hold as backing for currency and federal|reserve deposit have some|$22|billion in total gold stock and other international monetary reserve available and now pledge that full strength stand behind the value of the dollar for use if need moreover hold large asset abroad the total owe this nation far exceed the claim upon reserve and export once again substantially exceed import in short need not and shall not take any action to increase the dollar price of gold from an ounce to impose exchange control to reduce anti - recession effort to fall back on restrictive trade policy or to weaken commitment around the world this administration will not distort the value of the dollar in any fashion and this be a commitment prudence and good sense do require however that new step be take to ease the payment deficit and prevent any gold crisis success in world affair have long depend in part upon foreign confidence in ability to pay a series of executive order legislative remedy and cooperative effort with ally will get underway immediately aim at attract foreign investment and travel to this country promote american export at stable price and with more liberal government guarantee and financing curb tax and custom loophole that encourage undue spending of private dollar abroad and through oecd nato and otherwise share with ally all effort to provide for the common defense of the free world and the hope for growth of the less developed land while the current deficit last way will be find to ease dollar outlay abroad without place the full burden on the family of man whom have ask to serve flag overseas in short whatever be require will be do to back up all effort abroad and to make certain that in the future as in the past the dollar be as sound as a dollar but more than exchange of international payment be out of balance the current federal budget for fiscal|1961 be almost certain to show a net deficit the budget already submit for fiscal|1962 will remain in balance only if the congress enact all the revenue measure request and only if an early and sharp up turn in the economy than economic adviser now think likely produce the tax revenue estimate nevertheless a new administration must of necessity build on the spending and revenue estimate already submit within that framework bar the development of urgent national defense need or a worsening of the economy be current intention to advocate a program of expenditure which include revenue from a stimulation of the economy will not of and by unbalance the early budget however will do what must be do for national household be

these noble goal be persistently threaten by the conflict now engulf the world command whole attention absorb very being face a hostile ideology global in scope atheistic in character ruthless in purpose and insidious in method unhappily the danger pose promise to be of indefinite duration to meet successfully there be call for not so much the emotional and transitory sacrifice of crisis but rather those which enable to carry forward steadily surely and without complaint the burden of a prolonged and complex struggle with liberty the stake only thus shall remain despite every provocation on charted course toward permanent peace and human betterment crisis there will continue to be in meet whether foreign or domestic great or small there be a recur temptation to feel that some spectacular and costly action could become the miraculous solution to all current difficulty a huge increase in new element of defense development of unrealistic program to cure every ill in agriculture a dramatic expansion in basic and apply research these and many other possibility each possibly promise in may be suggest as the only way to the road wish to travel but each proposal must be weigh in the light of a broad consideration the need to maintain balance in and among national program balance between the private and the public economy balance between cost and hope for advantage balance between the clearly necessary and the comfortably desirable balance between essential requirement as a nation and the duty impose by the nation upon the individual balance between action of the moment and the national welfare of the future good judgment seek balance and progress lack of eventually find imbalance and frustration the record of many|decades stand as proof that people and government have in the main understand these truth and have respond to well in the face of stress and threat but threat new in kind or degree constantly arise mention only iv a vital element in keep the peace be military establishment arm must be mighty ready for instant action so that no potential aggressor may be tempt to risk own destruction military organization today bear little relation to that know by any of predecessor in peacetime or indeed by the fight man of world|war|ii or korea until the late of world conflict the|united|state have no armament industry american maker of plowshare

to this three|and|a|half|million man and woman be directly engage in the defense establishment annually spend on military security more than the net income of all united|state corporation this conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arm industry be new in the american experience the total influence economic political even spiritual be feel in every city every state house every office of the federal government recognize the imperative need for this development yet must not fail to comprehend grave implication toil resource and livelihood be all involve so be the very structure of society in the council of government must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether seek or unsought by the military industrial complex the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exist and will persist must never let the weight of this combination endanger liberty or democratic process should take nothing for grant only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with peaceful method and goal so that security and liberty may prosper together akin to and largely responsible for the sweeping change in industrial military posture have be the technological revolution during recent|decade in this revolution research have become central also become more formalized complex and costly a steadily increase share be conduct for by or at the direction of the federal government today the solitary inventor tinker in shop have be overshadow by task force of scientist in laboratory and testing field in the same fashion the free university historically the fountainhead of free idea and scientific discovery have experience a revolution in the conduct of

the prospect of domination of the nation 's scholar by federal employment project allocation and the power of money be ever present and be gravely to be regard yet in hold scientific research and discovery in respect as should must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could become the captive of a scientific technological elite be the task of statesmanship to mold to balance and to integrate these and other force new and old within the principle of democratic system ever aim toward the supreme goal of free society v. another factor in maintain balance involve the element of time as peer into society 's future and and government must avoid the impulse to live only for today plunder for own ease and convenience the precious resource of tomorrow can not

candidate for president of the|united|state be about to engage in fourth radio television discussion of the present campaign tonight these man will confine that discussion to foreign policy good evening vice president nixon mr nixon good evening mr. howe mr howe and good evening senator kennedy mr kennedy good evening mr. howe mr howe now let read the rule and condition under which the candidate have agree to proceed as do in first meeting both man will make opening statement of about|eight|minute each and close statement of equal time run three|to|five|minute each during between the opening and closing statement the candidate will answer and comment upon question from a panel of correspondent choose by the nationwide network that carry the program each candidate will be question in turn with opportunity for comment by the other each answer will be limit to and half|minute each comment to and half|minute the correspondent be free to ask any question choose in the field of foreign affair neither candidate know what question will be ask time alone will determine the final question reverse the order in first meeting senator kennedy will make the second open statement and the first closing statement for the first opening statement here be vice president nixon mr nixon mr. howe senator kennedy fellow americans since this campaign begin have have a very rare privilege have travel to of the state and in travel have learn what the people of the|united|state be think about there be issue that stand out above all the rest in which every american be concern regardless of what group may be a member and regardless of where may live and that issue very simply state be this how can keep the peace keep without surrender how can extend freedom extend without war now in determine how deal with this issue must find the answer to a very important but simple question who threaten the peace who threaten freedom in the world there be only|one threat to peace and threat to freedom that that be present by the international communist movement and therefore if be to have peace must know how to deal with the communists and leader know mr. khrushchev also have have the opportunity of know and meet other communist leader in the world believe there be certain principle must find in deal with and colleague principle if follow that will keep the peace and that also can extend freedom first have to learn from the past because can not afford to make the mistake of the past in the|seven|years before this administration come into power in washington find that six|hundred|million people go behind the iron curtain and at the end of that seven|year be engage in a war in korea which cost of thirty|thousand american life in in president eisenhower 's administration this situation have be reverse end by strong firm leadership have keep out of other war and have avoid surrender of principle or territory at the conference table now why be successful as predecessor be not successful think there be several reason in the first place make a fatal error in misjudge the communists in try to apply to the same rule of conduct that would apply to the leader of the free world of the major error make be the one that lead to in rule out the defense of korea invite aggression in that area think be go to have peace bring war learn from mistake and so in our|seven|years find that have be firm in diplomacy have never make concession without get concession in return have always be willing to go the extra mile to negotiate for disarmament or in any other area but have never be willing to do anything that in effect surrender freedom any place in the world that be why president eisenhower be correct in not apologize or express regret to mr. khrushchev at the|paris|conference as senator kennedy suggest could have do that be why senator wh- president eisenhower be also correct in policy in the|formosa|strait where decline and refuse to follow the recommendation recommendation which senator kennedy vote for in again make in again repeat in debate that have hear recommendation with regard to again slice off a piece of free territory and abandon if in effect to the communists why do the president feel this be wrong and why be the president right and critic wrong because again this show a lack of understanding of dictator a lack of understanding particularly of communists because every time make such a concession do not lead to peace only encourage to blackmail encourage to begin a war and so say that the record show that know how to keep the peace to keep without surrender let move now to the future be not enough to stand on this record because be deal with the most ruthless fanatical leader that the world have ever see that be why say that in this period of the sixty america must move forward in every area first of all although be today as senator kennedy have admit the strong nation in the world militarily must increase strength increase so that will always have enough strength that regardless of what potential opponent have if the should launch a surprise attack will be able to destroy war make capability must know in other word that be national suicide if begin anything need this kind of strength because be the guardian of the peace in addition to military strength need to see that the economy of this country continue to grow have grow in can and will grow even more in the|next|four and the reason that must grow even more be because have thing to do at home and also because be in a race for survival a race in which be not enough to be ahead be not enough simply to be complacent have to move ahead in order to stay ahead and that be why in this field have make recommendation which be confident will move the american economy ahead move firmly and soundly so that there will never be a time when the|soviet|union will be able to challenge superiority in this field and so need military strength need economic strength also need the right diplomatic policy what be again turn to the past firmness but no belligerence and by no belligerence mean that do not answer insult by insult when be proud and confident of strength do not get down to the level of mr. khrushchev and colleague and that example that president eisenhower have set will continue to follow but all this by be not enough be not enough for simply to be the strong nation militarily the strong economically and also to have firm diplomacy must have a great goal and that be not just to keep freedom for but to extend to all the world to extend to all the world because that be america 's destiny to extend to all the world because the communist aim be not to hold own but to extend communism and can not fight a victory for communism or a strategy of victory for communism with the strategy simply of hold the line and so say that believe that policy of military strength of economic strength of diplomatic firmness first will keep the peace and keep without surrender also believe that in the great field of ideal that can lead america to the victory for freedom victory in the newly develop country victory also in the captive country provide have faith in and faith in principle mr howe now the open statement of senator kennedy mr kennedy mr. howe mr. vice president first uh let again try to correct the record on the matter of quemoy and matsu vote for the formosa resolution in have sustain since then have say that agree with the administration policy mr. nixon earlier indicate that would defend quemoy and matsu even if the attack on these island two|mil off the coast of china be not part of a general attack an formosa and the pescadore indicate that would defend those island if the attack be direct against pescadores|and|formosa which be part of the eisenhower policy have support that policy in the|last|week as a member of the|senate|foreign|relations|committee have re - read the testimony of general|twine represent the administration in and the assistant secretary of state before the|foreign|relations|committee in and have accurately describe the administration policy and support wholeheartedly so that really be not an issue in this campaign be not an issue with mr. nixon who now say that also support the eisenhower policy nor be the question that all americans want peace and security an issue in this campaign the question be be move in the direction of peace and security be relative strength grow be as mr. nixon say prestige at an all time high as say a|week|ago and that of the communists at an all time low do not believe be do not believe that relative strength be increase and say that not as the democratic standard bearer but as a citizen of the|united|state who be concerned about the|united|state look at cuba ninety|miles off the coast of the|united|state in be in havana talk to the american ambassador there say that be the second most powerful man in cuba and yet even though ambassador smith and ambassador gardner both republican|ambassador both warn of castro the marxist influence around castro the communist influence around castro both of have testify in the|last|six|week that in spite of warning to the american government nothing be do d- security depend upon can any american look at the situation in latin|america feel content with what be happen today when a candidate for the presidency of brazil feel necessary to call not on washington during the campaign but on castro in havana in order to pick up the support of the castro supporter in brazil at american|conference this|summer when want to join together in the denunciation of castro and the cuban communists could not even get the inter - american group to join together in denounce castro be rather a vague statement that finally make do know today that the com- the russians broadcast time as many program in spanish to latin|america as do do know do not have a single program sponsor by government to cuba to tell story to tell that be friend that want to be free again africa be now the emerge area of the world contain five|percent of all the member of the|general|assembly do not even have a bureau|of|african|affair until in the africa south of the sahara which be the major new section have less student from all of africa in that area study under government auspex today than from the country of thailand if there be thing africa need be technical assistance and yet last|year give less|than|five|percent of all the technical assistance fund that distribute around the world rely in the|middle|east on the|baghdad|pact and yet when the|iraqi|government be change the|baghdad|pact break down rely on the|eisenhower|doctrine for the|middle|east which pass the senate there be not country in the|middle|east that now endorse look to europe uh to asia because the struggle be in the underdeveloped world which system communism or freedom will triumph in the|next|five|or|ten|year that be what should concern not the history of or or but be do enough in these area what be freedom 's chance in those area by or will there be other cubas in latin|america will|guinea and ghana which have now vote with the communists frequently as newly independent country of africa will there be other will the congo go communist will other country be do enough in that area and what about asia be india go to win the economic struggle or be china go to win who will dominate asia in the|next|five|or|ten|year communism the chinese or will freedom the question which have to decide as americans be do enough today be strength and prestige rise do people want to be identify with do want to follow united|stat leadership do not think do enough and that be what concern in africa these country that have newly join the|united|nation on the question of admission of red|china only|two country in all of africa vote with liberia and the|union|of|south|africa the rest either abstain or vote against more country in asia vote against on that question than vote with believe that this struggle be go to go on and may be well decide in the|next|decade have see cuba go to the communists have see communist influence and castro influence rise in have see ignore africa there be country in africa that be member of the|united|nation there be not a single american diplomatic representative in any of those when guinea become independent the soviet ambassador show up that very day do not recognize for two|month the american ambassador do not show up for nearly|eight|month believe that the world be change fast and do not think this administration have show the foresight have show the knowledge have be identify with the great fight which these people be wag to be free to get a well standard of living to live better the average income in some of those country be five|dollar a year the communists say come with look what have do and have be in on the whole uninterested think be go to have to do better mr. nixon talk about be the strong country in the world think be today but be far strong relative to the communists and what be of great concern be that the balance of power be in danger of move with make a breakthrough in missile and by nineteen|sixty and will be outnumber in missile be not as confident as be that will be the strong military power by talk about economic growth as a great indicator of freedom agree with what do in this country the kind of society that build that will tell whether freedom will be sustain around the world and yet in the|last|nine|months|of|this|year have have a drop in economic growth rather than a gain have have the low rate of increase of economic growth in of any major industrialized society in the world look up and see the soviet flag on the moon the fact be that the|state|department poll on prestige and influence around the world have show such a sharp drop that up till now the|state|department have be unwilling to release and yet be poll by the u.s.i.a. the point of all this be this be a struggle in which be engage want peace want freedom want security want to be strong want freedom to gain but do not believe in these change and revolutionary time this administration have know that the world be change have identify with that change think the communists have be move with vigor laos africa cuba all around the world today be on the move think have to revita1ize society think have to demonstrate to the people of the world that be determined in this free country of to be first not first if and not first but and not first when but first and when be strong and when be first then freedom gain then the prospect for peace increase then the prospect for society gain mr howe that complete the opening statement now the candidate will answer and comment upon question put by these correspondent frank|singiser of mutual|new john|edward of abc|news walter|cronkite of cbs|new john chancellor of nbc|news frank|singiser have the first question for vice president nixon mr singiser mr. vice president would like to pin down the difference between the way would handle castro 's regime and prevent the establishment of communist government in the|western|hemisphere and the way that t senator kennedy would proceed uh vice president nixon in what important respect do feel there be difference between and why do believe policy be well for the peace and security of the|united|state in the|western|hemisphere mr nixon policy be very different think that senator kennedy 's policy and recommendation for the handling of the castro regime be probably the most dangers- dangerously irresponsible recommendation that be make during the course of this campaign in effect what senator kennedy recommend be that the united|states government should give help to the exile and to those within cuba who oppose the castro regime provide be anti - batista now let just see what this mean have five|treatie with latin|america include the one set up the|organization|of|american|state in bogota in in which have agree not to intervene in the internal affair of any other american country and as well have agree to do likewise the charter of the|united|nation preamble article|i|and|article|ii|-|also|provide|that|there|shall|be|no|intervention|by|one|nation|in|the|internal|affairs|of|another now do not know what senator kennedy suggest when say that should help those who oppose the castro regime both in cuba and without but do know this that if be to follow that recommendation that would lose all of friend in latin|america would probably be condemn in the|united|nation and would not accomplish objective know something else would be an open invitation for mr. khrushchev to come in to come into latin|america and to engage in what would be a civil war and possibly even bad than that this be the major recommendation that be make now what can do well can do what do with guatemala there be a communist dictator that inherit from the previous administration quarantine mr. arbenz the result be that the guatemalan people eventually rise up and throw out be quarantine mr. castro today be quarantine diplomatically by bring back ambassador economically by cut off trade and senator kennedy 's suggestion that the trade that cut off be not significant be just|one|hundred|percent wrong be cut off the significant item that the cuban regime need in order to survive by cut off trade by cut off diplomatic relation as have will quarantine this regime so that the people of cuba will take care of mr. castro but for to do what senator kennedy have suggest would bring result which know would not want and certainly which the american people would not want mr kennedy mr. nixon uh show misinform surely must be aware that most of the equipment and arm and resource for castro come from the|united|state flow out of florida and other part of the|united|state to castro in the mountain there be not any doubt about that number number believe that if any economic sanction against latin|america be go to be successful have to be multilateral have to include the other country of the very minute effect of the action which have be take this|week on cuba 's economy believe castro can replace those market very easily through latin|america through europe and through if the|united|state have strong prestige and influence in latin|america could persuade as franklin|roosevelt do in the country of to join in an economic quarantine of castro that be the only way can bring real economic pressure on the castro regime and also the country of western|europe canada japan and the other number castro be only the beginning of difficulty throughout the big struggle will be to prevent the influence of castro spread to other country mexico panama bolivia colombia be go to have to try to provide close tie to associate with the great desire of these people for a well life if be go to prevent castro 's influence from spread throughout all of influence be strong enough today to prevent from joi- get the other country of to join with in economic quarantine influence be grow mostly because this administration have ignore say mr. vice president a|month|ago that if have provide the kind of economic aid that be now provide may never have have castro why do not mr howe john|edward have first question for senator kennedy mr edwards senator kennedy test of a new president 's leadership will be the caliber of appointment be a matter of interest here and overseas as to who will be the new secretary of state now under rule must ask this question of but would hope that the vice president also would answer will give the name of three|or|four americans each of whom if appoint would serve with distinction in judgment as secretary of state mr kennedy mr. edwards do not think be a wise idea for presidential candidate to appoint the member of cabinet prospectively or to suggest people indicate that of surely will be appoint this be a decision that the president of the|united|state must make the last candidate who indicate that know who cabinet be go to be be mr. dewey in this be a race between the vice president and for the presidency of the|united|state there be a good many able man who could be secretary of state have make no judgment about who should be secretary of state think that judgment could be make after election if be successful the people have to make a choice between mr. nixon and between the republican party and the democratic party between approach to the problem which now disturb as a nation and disturb as a world power the president bear the constitutional responsibility not the secretary of state for the conduct of foreign affair some president have be strong in foreign policy other have rely heavily on the secretary of state have be a member of the|senate|foreign|relations|committee run for the presidency with full knowledge that great responsibility really give to by the constitution and by the force of event be in the field of foreign affair be ask the people 's support as president will select the good man can get but have not make a judgment and have not narrow down a list of three|or|four people among whom would be the candidate mr howe mr. vice president do have a comment mr nixon well mr. edwards as probably know have consistently answer all question with regard to who will be in the next cabinet by say that that be the responsibility of the next president and would be inappropriate to make any decision on that or to announce any prior to the time that have the right to do so so that be answer to this question if do not mind would like to use the balance of the time to respond to of the comment that senator kennedy make on the previous question eh- be talk about the castro regime and what have be eh- do in would like to point out that when look at program in latin|america find that have appropriate time as much for latin|america as be appropriate by the previous administration find that have two|billion|dollars more for the|export import|bank have a new bank for latin|america alone of a|billion|dollar have the new program which be submit at the|bogota|conference|-|this new program that president eisenhower submit approve by the last congress for five|hundred|million|dollar have move in latin|america very effectively and would also like to point this out senator kennedy complain very appropriately about inadequate ra- radio broadcast for latin|america let point out again that congress the democratic congress have cut eighty|million|dollar off of the|voice|of|america appropriation now have to get a well job out of congress if be go to get the money that need to conduct the foreign affair of this country in latin|america or any place else mr howe walter|cronkite have first question for vice president nixon mr cronkite thank quincy mr. vice president senator fulbright and now tonight senator kennedy maintain that the administration be suppress a report by the|united|states|information|agency that show a decline in united|stat prestige overseas be aware of such a report and if be aware of the existence of such a report should not that report because of the great importance this issue have be give in this campaign be release to the public mr nixon mr. cronkite naturally be aware of because of course pay attention to everything senator kennedy say as well as senator fulbright now in this connection want to point out that the fact simply be not as state first of all the report to which senator kennedy refer be that be make many and relate particularly to the uh period immediately after sputnik second as far as this report be concerned would have no objection to have make public third would say this with regard to this report with regard to gallup|poll of prestige abroad and everything else that have be hear about what about american prestige abroad america 's prestige abroad will be just as high as the spokesman for america allow to be now when have a presidential candidate for example senator kennedy state over and over again that the|united|states be second in space and the fact of the matter be that the space score today be to have have successful shot have have when state that be second in education and have see soviet education and have see and be not that be second in science because may be ahead in area or another when overall be way ahead of the|soviet|union and all other country in science when say as do in january|of|this|year that have the bad slum that have the most crowded school when say that seventeen|million people go to bed hungry every|night when make statement like this what do this do to american prestige well can only have the effect certainly of reduce well let make thing clear senator kennedy have a responsibility to criticize those thing that be wrong but have also a responsibility to be right in criticism every of these item that have mention be be wrong dead wrong and for that reason have contribute to any lack of prestige finally let say this as far as prestige be concern the first place would show up would be in the|united|nation now senator kennedy have refer to the vote on communist china let look at the vote on hungary there get more vote for condemn hungary and look into that situation than get the|last|year let look at the reaction eh reaction to khrushchev and eisenhower at the last u.n. session do khrushchev gain because take shoe off and pound the table and shout and insult not at all the president gain america gain by continue the dignity the decency that have characterize and be that that keep the prestige of america up not run down america the way senator kennedy have be run down mr howe comment senator kennedy mr kennedy really do not need uh mr. nixon to tell about what responsibility be as a citizen have serve this country for fourteen|years in the congress and before that in the service have just as high a devotion just as high an opinion what downgrade mr. nixon be the leadership the country be get not the country now do not make most of the statement that say make the believe the|soviet|union be first in outer space have may have make more shot but the size of rocket thrust and all the rest say to khrushchev may be ahead of in rocket thrust but be ahead of in color television in famous discussion in the kitchen think that color television be not as important as rocket thrust secondly do not say have the bad slum in the world say have too many slum and that be bad and ought to do something about and ought to support housing legislation which this administration have oppose do not say have the bad education in the world what say be that ten|years|ago be produce twice as many scientist and engineer as the|soviet|union and today be produce twice as many as be and that this affect security around the world and fourth believe that the poll and other study and vote in the|united|nation and anyone read the paper and any citizen of the|united|state must come to the conclusion that the|united|stat no longer carry the same image of a vital society on the move with bright day ahead as carry a|decade or two|decades|ago part of that be because have stand still here at home because have not meet problem in the|united|state because have not have a move economy part of that as the gallup polls show be because the|soviet|union make a breakthrough in outer space mr. george|allen head of information|service have say that that make the people of the world begin to wonder whether be first in science be first in other area of science but in space which be the new science be not first mr howe john|chancellor first question for senator kennedy mr chancellor senator another question uh in connection with relation with the russians there have be story from washington from the|atomic|energy|commission hint that the russians may have resume the testing of nuclear device now if sir if this be true should resume nuclear testing and if the russians do not start test can foresee any circumstance in in which the|united|state may resume own series of test mr kennedy yes think the next president of the|united|state should make last effort to secure an agreement on the cessation of test number think should go back to geneva who be ever elect president mr. nixon or and try once again if fail then if be unable to come to an agreement and hope can come to an agreement because do not merely involve now the|united|state britain france and the|soviet|union as atomic power because new breakthrough in atomic energy technology there be some indication that by the time the next president 's term of office have come to an end there may be or country with an atomic capacity perhaps that many testing bomb with all the effect that could have on the atmosphere and with all the chance that more and more country will have an atomic capacity with more and more chance of war so more effort should be make do not think that even if that effort fail that will be necessary to carry on test in the atmosphere which pollute the atmosphere can be carry out underground could be carry on in outer space but believe the effort should be make once more by who be ever elect president of the|united|state if fail be be a great serious failure for everyone for the human race hope can succeed but then if fail responsibility will be clearly on the russians and then will have to meet responsibility to the security of the|united|state and there may have to be test underground think the|atomic|energy|committee be prepare for there may be test in outer space hope will not be necessary for any power to resume uh testing in the atmosphere be possible to detect those kind of test the kind of test which can not detect be underground or in in uh perhaps in outer space so that be hopeful can try once more if fail then must meet responsibility to but be most concerned about the whole problem of the spread of atomic weapon china may have by egypt war have be the constant companion of mankind so to have these weapon disseminate around the world believe mean that be go to move through a period of hazard in the|next|few|year ought to make last effort mr howe any comment mr. vice president mr nixon yes would say first of all that must have in mind the fact that have be negotiate to get test inspect and uh to get an agreement for many many|months as a matter of fact there be be a moratorium on testing as a result of the fact that have be negotiate have reach the conclusion that the|soviet|union be actually filibuster have reach the conclusion too base on the report that have be make that may be cheat do not think can wait until the next president be inaugurate and then uh select a new team and then all|the|month of negotiate that will take place before reach a decision think that immediately after this election should set a timetable the next president work with the present president president eisenhower a timetable to break the soviet filibuster there should be no test in the atmosphere that rule out any fall out but as far as underground test for develop peaceful us of atomic energy should not allow this soviet filibuster to continue think be time for to fish or cut bait think that the next president immediately after election should sit down with the president work out a timetable and get a decision on this before january|of|next|year mr howe second round of question begin with from mr. edwards for the vice president mr edwards mr. nixon carry forward this business about a timetable as know the pressure be increase for a summit conference now both and senator kennedy have say that there be certain condition which must be meet before would meet with khrushchev will be more specific about these condition mr nixon well the condition lay out in of previous television debate and be rather difficult to be much more specific than that uh first of all have to have adequate preparation for a summit conference this mean at the secretary of state level and at the ambassadorial level by adequate preparation mean that at that level must prepare an agenda an agenda agree upon with the approval of the head of state involve now this agenda should delineate those issue on which there be a possibility of some agreement or negotiation do not believe should go to a summit conference unless have such an agenda unless have some reasonable insur- assurance from mr. khrushchev that intend seriously to negotiate on those point now this may seem like a rigid inflexible position but let look at the other side of the coin if build up the hope of the world by have a summit conference that be not adequately prepare and then if mr. khrushchev find some excuse for break up as do this because be not go to get way would set back the cause of peace do not help can in other word negotiate many of these item of difference between without go to the summit think have to make a great effort than have be make at the secretary of state level at the ambassadorial level to work out the difference that have and so far as the summit conference be concern should only be enter in upon should only be agree upon if the negotiation have reach the point that have some reasonable assurance that something be go to come out of other than some phony spirit a spirit of geneva or camp|david or whatever be when say phony spirit mean phony not because the spirit be not good on side but because the|soviet|union simply do not intend to carry out what say now these be the condition that can lay out can not be more precise than that because until see what mr. khrushchev do and what say uh can not indicate what plan will be mr howe any comment senator kennedy mr kennedy well think the president of last|winter indicate that before would go to the summit in may do last|fall indicate that there should be some agenda that there should be some prior agreement hope that there would be uh be an agreement in part in disarmament also express the hope that there should be some understanding of the general situation in berlin the|soviet|union refuse to agree to that and go to the summit and be disastrous believe should not go to the summit until there be some reason to believe that a meeting of mind can be obtain on either berlin outer space or general disarmament include nuclear testing in addition believe the next president in january and february should go to work in build the strength of the|united|state the|soviet|union do understand strength arm to parley winston|churchill say ten|years|ago if be strong particularly as face a crisis over berlin which may in the spring or in the winter be important that maintain determination here that indicate that be build strength that be determined to protect position that be determined to protect commitment and then believe should indicate desire to live at peace with the world but until be strong here until be move here believe a summit could not be successful hope that before do meet there will be preliminary agreement on those question or at|least|two of or even of which would warrant such a meeting think if have stick by that position last|winter would have be in a well position in may mr howe have time for only|one or more question before the closing statement now walter|cronkite 's question for senator kennedy mr cronkite senator the charge have be make frequently that the|united|state for many|years have be on the defensive around the world that policy have be uh of reaction to the|soviet|union rather than positive action on own what area do see where the|united|state may take the offensive in a challenge to communism over the|next|four|to|eight|years mr kennedy of the area and of course the most vulnerable area be have feel have be have be critical of the administration 's failure to suggest policy which would make possible for to establish for example close relation with poland particularly after the period and the hungarian revolution indicate at that time that be not go to intervene militarily but there be a period there when poland demonstrate a national independence and even the polish government move some differn- distance away from the|soviet|union suggest that amend legislation so that could enjoy close economic tie receive the support first of the administration and then not and be defeat by vote in the senate pass the bill in the senate this|year but do not pass the house would say eastern|europe be the area of vulnerability of the uh s- of the|soviet|union secondly the relation between russia and china be now engage in a debate over whether war be the mean of communize the world or whether should use subversion infiltration economic struggle and all the rest no one can say what that course of action will be but think the next president of the|united|state should watch carefully if those power should split could have great effect throughout the entire world thirdly believe that india represent a great area for affirmative action by the free world india start from about the same place that china do chinese communists have be move ahead the|last|ten|year india under a free society have be make some progress but if india do not succeed with four|hundred|and|fifty|million people if can not make freedom work then people around the world be go to determine particularly in the underdeveloped world that the only way that can develop resource be through the communist system fourth let say that in africa asia latin|america the great force on side be the desire of people to be free this have express in the revolt in be express in the desire of the people of africa to be independent of western|europe want to be free and judgment be that do not want to give freedom up to become communists want to stay free independent perhaps of but certainly independent of the communists and believe if identify with that force if identify with as lincoln as wilson do as franklin|roosevelt do if become know as the friend of freedom sustain freedom help freedom help these people in the fight against poverty and ignorance and disease help build life believe in latin|america africa and asia eventually in the|eastern|europe and the|middle|east certainly in western|europe can strengthen freedom can make move can put the communists on the defensive mr howe comment mr. vice president mr nixon first with regard to poland when talk to mr. gomulka the present leader of poland for six|hour in warsaw last|year learn something about problem and particularly right under the soviet gun with soviet troop there be in a very difficult position in take anything independent a position which would be independent of the|soviet|union and yet let just see what have do for poland a half a dollar worth of aid have go to poland primarily economic primarily to go to the people of poland this should continue and can be step up to give hope and to keep alive the hope for freedom that can testify have so deeply within in addition can have more exchange with poland or with any other of the iron curtain country which show some desire to take a different path than the path that have be take by the one that be complete satellite of the|soviet|union now as far as the balance of the world be concern of course do not have as much time as senator kennedy have would just like to add this point if be go to have the initiative in the world must remember that the people of africa and asia and latin|america do not want to be pawn simply in a struggle between great power the|soviet|union and the|united|state have to let know that want to help not because be simply try to save own skin not because be simply try to fight communism but because care for because stand for freedom because if there be no communism in the world would still fight poverty and misery and disease and tyranny if can get that across to the people of these country in this|decade of the|sixty the struggle for freedom will be win mr howe john|chancellor 's question for vice president nixon mr chancellor sir would like to ask an- another question about quemoy and matsu both and senator kennedy say agree with the president on this subject and with treaty obligation but the subject remain in the campaign as an issue now be sir be this because each of feel oblige to respond to the other when talk about quemoy and matsu and if that be true do think an end should be call to this discussion or will stay with as a campaign issue mr nixon would say that the issue will stay with as a campaign issue just as long as senator kennedy persist in what think be a fundamental error say support the president 's position say that vote for the resolution well just let point this out vote for the resolution in which give the president the power to use the force of the|united|state to defend formosa and the offshore island but also vote then for an amendment which be lose fortunately an amendment which would have draw a line and leave out those island and deny the p- right to the president to defend those island if think that be an attack on formosa repeat that error in in the speech that make repeat again in a television debate that have now point be this senator kennedy have get to be consistent here either be for the president and be against the position that those who oppose the president in five|and|fifty and the senator 's position state the|other|day in debate either be for the president and against that position or simply have a disagreement here that must continue to be debate now if the senator in answer to this question will say now will depart or retract previous view think be wrong in i think be wrong in and think be wrong in television debate to say that should draw a line leave out quemoy and matsu draw a line in effect abandon these island to the communists then this will be right out of the campaign because there will be no issue between support the president 's position have always oppose draw a line have oppose draw a line because know that the moment draw a line that be an encouragement for the communists to attack to step up blackmail and to force into the war that none of want and so would hope that senator kennedy in answer today would clear up be not enough for to say support the president 's position that vote for the resolution of course vote for the resolution be virtually unanimous but the point be what about error in voting for the amendment which be not adopt and then persist in in persist in in the debate be very simple for to clear up can say now that no longer believe that a line should be draw leave these island out of the perimeter of defense if say that this issue will not be discuss in the campaign mr howe senator kennedy comment mr kennedy well mr. nixon to go back to the resolution commit the president in the|united|state which support to defend uh formosa the pescadore and if be military judgment these island then the president send a mission compose of admiral radford and mr. robertson to persuade chiang|kai shek in the spring of to withdraw from the island because be expose the president be unsuccessful chiang|kai shek would not withdraw refer to the fact that in as a member of the|senate|foreign|relations|committee be very familiar with the position that the|united|stat take in negotiating with the chinese communists on these island general twining in january describe the position of the|united|state the position of the|united|state have be that this build up in the word of the president have be foolish mr. herter have say these island be indefensible chiang|kai shek will not withdraw because will not withdraw because be commit to these island because have be unable to persuade to withdraw be in a very difficult position and therefore the president 's judgment have be that should defend the island if in military judgment and the judgment of the commander in the field the attack on these island should be part of an overall attack on formosa support that in view of the difficulty have have with the island in view of the difficulty and dispute have have with chiang|kai shek that be the only position can take that be not the position take however the first position take when this matter first come up be that should draw the line and commit as a matter of principle to defend these island not as part of the defense of formosa and the pescadore show no recognition of the administration program to try to persuade chiang|kai shek for to withdraw from the island and challenge tonight to deny that the administration have send at least several mission to persuade chiang|kai shek 's withdrawal from these island mr howe under the agree mr kennedy and that be the testimony of uh general twining and the assistant secretary of state in mr howe under the agree rule gentleman have exhaust the time for question each candidate will now have four|minutes|and|thirty|second for closing statement senator kennedy will make the first final closing statement mr kennedy uh say that have serve this country for fourteen|years serve uh in the war be devoted to if lose this election will continue in the senate to try to build a strong country but run because believe this|year the|united|state have a great opportunity to make a move forward to make a determination here at home and around the world that be go to reestablish as a vigorous society judgment be that the republican party have stand still here in the|united|state and be also stand still around the world uh be use about|fifty|percent of steel capacity today have a recession in have a recession in be not move ahead in education the way should do not make a judgment in and six|and|fifty five|and|fifty that outer space would be important if stand still here if appoint people to ambassadorship and position in washington who have a status quo outlook who do not recognize that this be a revolutionary time then the|united|state do not maintain influence and if fail the cause of freedom fail believe incumbent upon the next president of the|united|state to get this country move again to get economy move ahead to set before the american people goal unfinished business and then throughout the world appoint the good people can get ambassador who can speak the language no mere not merely people who make a political contribution but who can speak the language bring student here let see what kind of a country have mr. nixon say that should not regard as pawn in the cold war should identify with if that be true why do not identify with the people of africa why do not bring student over here why do suddenly offer congo three|hundred student when have the tremendous revolt that be more than have offer to all of africa before from the federal government believe that this party republican party have stand still really for five|year leadership have oppose all of the program of president roosevelt and other the minimum wage and for housing and economic growth and development of natural resource the|tennessee|valley and all the rest and believe that if can get a party which believe in movement which believe in go ahead then can reestablish position in the world strong defense strong in economic growth justice for people co- guarantee of constitutional right so that people will believe that practice what preach and then around the world particularly to try to reestablish the atmosphere which exist in latin|america at the time of franklin|roosevelt be a good neighbor in latin|america because be a good neighbor in the|united|state because see as a society that be compassionate that care about people that be move this country ahead believe responsibility as the leader of the democratic party in to try to warn the american people that in this crucial time can no longer afford to stand still can no longer afford to be second good want people all over the world to look to the|united|state again to feel that be on the move to feel that our|high|noon be in the future want mr. khrushchev to know that a new generation of americans who fight in europe and italy and the pacific for freedom in world|war|ii have now take over in the|united|state and that be go to put this country back to work again do not believe that there be anything this country can not do do not believe there be any burden or any responsibility that any american would not assume to protect country to protect security to advance the cause of freedom and believe incumbent upon now to do that franklin|roosevelt say in that that generation of americans have a rendezvous with destiny believe in and and and have a rendezvous with destiny and believe incumbent upon to be the defender of the|united|state and the defender of freedom and to do that must give this country leadership and must get america move again mr howe now vice president nixon closing statement mr nixon senator kennedy have say tonight again what have say several time in the course of this these debate and in the campaign that american be stand still america be not stand still have not be stand still and let set the record straight right now by look at the record as use to say talk about housing build more house in than in any administration and thirty|percent more than in the previous administration talk about school time as many classroom build in the past administration and eisenhower|-|than under the|truman|administration let talk about civil right more progress in the|past|eight|years than in the whole year before talk about the progress in the field of slum clearance and the like find time as many project undertake and complete in this administration than in the previous one anybody that say america have be stand still for the|last|seven|and|a|half|year have not be travel in america be be in some other country let get that straight right away now the second point have to understand be this however america have not be stand still but america can not stand pat can not stand pat for the reason that be in a race as have indicate can not stand pat because be essential with the conflict that have around the world that not just hold own that not keep just freedom for be essential that extend freedom extend to all the world and this mean more than what have be do mean keep america even stronger militarily than be mean see that economy move forward even faster than have mean make more progress in civil right than have so that can be a splendid example for all the world to see a democracy in action at good now look at the other part of the world talk about record and the previous one have a good neighbor policy yes sound fine but let look at there be dictator when come into power in in latin|america there be only|three leave let look at africa new country in africa during the course of this administration not of select a communist government all of vote for freedom a free type of government do this show that communism have the big pull or freedom have the big pull be try to indicate that have no problem in africa or latin|america or asia of course not what be try to indicate be that the tide of history be on side and that can keep on side because be on the right side be on the side of freedom be on the side of justice against the force of slavery against the force of injustice but be not go to move america forward and be not go to be able to lead the world to win this struggle for freedom if have a permanent inferiority complex about american achievement because be first in the world in space as have indicate be first in science be first in education and be go to move even further ahead with the kind of leadership that can provide in other point would make what could do senator kennedy and be candidate for the presidency of the|united|state and in the|year to come will be write that or the other of be elect and that be or be not a great president what will determine whether senator kennedy or if be elect be a great president will not be ambition that will determine because greatness be not something that be write on a campaign poster will be determine to the extent that represent the deep ideal the high feeling and faith of the american people in other word the next president as lead america and the free world can be only as great as the american people be great and so say in conclusion keep america 's faith strong see that the young people of america particularly have faith in the ideal of freedom and faith in god which distinguish from the atheistic materialist who oppose mr howe thank gentleman both candidate have ask to express thank to the network for this opportunity to appear on this discussion may repeat that all those concerned in tonight 's discussion have sometimes reluctantly follow the rule and condition read at the outset and agree to in advance by the candidate and the network the opening statement run

policy last word as member of a new political generation vice president nixon and senator kennedy have use new mean of communication to pioneer a new type of political debate the character and courage with which these man have speak set a high standard for generation to come surely have set a new precedent perhaps have establish a new tradition this be quincy|howe good night from new|york & nbsp & nbsp view transcript transcript bill shadel moderator good evening be bill|shadel of abc|news be privilege this|evening to preside at this the third in the series of meeting on radio and television of the major presidential candidate now like the last meeting the subject to be discuss will be suggest by question from a panel of correspondent unlike the first program however the candidate will not be share the same platform in new|york the democratic presidential nominee senator john|f.|kennedy separate by three|thousand|miles in a studio the republican presidential nominee vice president richard|m.|nixon now join for tonight 's discussion by a network of electronic facility which permit each candidate to see and hear the other good evening senator kennedy mr kennedy good evening mr. shadel mr shadel and good evening to vice president nixon mr nixon good evening mr. shadel mr shadel and now to meet the panel of correspondent frank|mcgee nbc|news charles|van|fremd cbs|news douglass|cater reporter magazine roscoe|drummond new|york|herald|tribune now as have probably note the reporter include a newspaper man and a magazine reporter these select by lot by the press secretary of the candidate from among the reporter travel with the candidate the broadcasting representative be choose by company the rule for this|evening have be agree upon by the representative of both candidate and the radio and television network and should like to read there will be no opening statement by the candidate nor any closing summation the|entire|hour will be devote to answer question from the reporter each candidate to be question in turn with opportunity for comment by the other each answer will be limit to and half|minute each comment to and a|half|minute the reporter be free to ask any question choose on any subject neither candidate know what question will be ask time alone will dete- determine who will be ask the final question now the first question be from mr. mcgee and be for senator kennedy mr mcgee senator kennedy yesterday use the word trigger happy in refer to vice president richard|nixon 's stand on defend the island of quemoy and matsu last|week on a program like this one say the next president would come face to face with a serious crisis in berlin so the question be would take military action to defend berlin mr kennedy mr. mcgee have a contractual right to be in berlin come out of the conversation at potsdam and of world|war|ii that have be reinforce by direct commitment of the president of the|united|state be be reinforce by a number of other nation under nato have state on many occasion that the|united|states must meet commitment on berlin be a commitment that have to meet if be go to protect the security of western|europe and therefore on this question do not think that there be any doubt in the mind of any american hope there be not any doubt in the mind of any member of the community of west|berlin be sure there be not any doubt in the mind of the russians will meet commitment to maintain the freedom and independence of west|berlin mr shadel mr. vice president do wish to comment mr nixon yes as a matter of fact the statement that senator kennedy make be that to the effect that there be trigger happy republicans that stand on quemoy and matsu be an indication of trigger happy republicans resent that comment resent because be an implication that republicans have be trigger happy and therefore would lead this nation into war would remind senator kennedy of the|past|fifty|years would ask to name republican president who lead this nation into war there be democratic president who lead into war do not mean by that that party be a war party and the other party be a peace party but do say that any statement to the effect that the republican party be trigger happy be belie by the record have a war when come into power in get rid of that have keep out of other war and certainly that do not indicate that be trigger happy have be strong but have not be trigger happy as far as berlin be concern there be not any question about the necessity of defend berlin the right of people there to be free and there be not any question about what the united american people republicans and democrats alike would do in the event there be an attempt by the communists to take over berlin mr shadel the next question be by mr. von|fremd for vice president nixon mr von fremd mr. vice president a part question concern the offshore island in the|formosa|strait if be president and the chinese communists tomorrow begin an invasion of quemoy and matsu would launch the uh into a war by send the|seventh|fleet and other military force to resist this aggression and secondly if the uh regular conventional force fail to halt such uh such an invasion would authorize the use of nuclear weapon mr nixon mr. von|fremd would be completely irresponsible for a candidate for the presidency or for a president to indicate the course of action and the weapon would use in the event of such an attack will say this in the event that such an attack occur and in the event the attack be a prelude to an attack on formosa which would be the indication today because the chinese communists say over and over again that objective be not the offshore island that consider only steppingstone to take formosa in the event that attack then be a prelude to an attack on formosa there be not any question but that the|united|states would then again as in the case of berlin honor treaty obligation and stand by ally of formosa but to indicate in advance how would respond to indicate the nature of this response would be incorrect would certainly be inappropriate would not be in the good interest of the|united|state will only say this however in addition to do what senator kennedy have suggest to suggest that will surrender these island or force chinese nationalist ally to surrender in advance be not something that would lead to peace be something that would lead in opinion to war this be the history of deal with dictator this be something that senator kennedy and all americans must know try this with hitler do not work want first uh know austria and then go on to the sudetenland and then danzig and each time be think this be all that want now what do the chinese communists want do not want just quemoy and matsu do not want just formosa want the world and the question be if surrender or indicate in advance that be not go to defend any part of the free world and figure that be go to satisfy do not satisfy only whet appetite and then the question come when do stop have often hear president eisenhower in discuss this question make the statement that if once start the process of indicate that this point or that point be not the place to stop those who threaten the peace and freedom of the world where do stop and say that those of who stand against surrender of territory this or any other in the face of blackmail in the s- face of force by the communists be stand for the course that will lead to peace mr shadel senator kennedy do wish to comment mr kennedy yes the whole th- the|united|state now have a treaty which vote for in the|united|states|senate in to defend formosa and the island which mr. nixon be discuss be five|or|four|mile respectively off the coast of china now when senator green the chairman of the|senate|foreign|relations|committee write to the president receive back on the|second|of|october,|1958 neither nor any other american need feel the u.s. will be involve in military hostility merely in the defense of quemoy and matsu now that be the issue believe must meet commitment to uh formosa support and that be the present american position the treaty do not include these island mr. nixon suggest uh that the|united|states should go to war if these island be attack suggest that if formosa be attack or the pescadore or if there be any military action in any area which indicate an attack on formosa and the pescadore then of course the|united|states be at war to defend treaty now must say what mr. nixon want to do be commit as understand so that can be clear if there be a disagreement want to be commit to the defense of these island merely as the defense of these island as free territory not as part of the defense of formosa admiral yarnell the commander of the asiatic fleet have say that these island be not worth the bone of a single american the president of the|united|state have indicate be not within the treaty area be not within the treaty area when the treaty be pass in have attempt to persuade chiang|kai shek as late as january of to reduce the number of troop have on this be a serious issue and think ought to understand completely if disagree and if so where mr shadel mr. cater have the next question for senator kennedy mr cater senator kennedy last|week say that before should hold another summit conference that be important that the|united|state build strength modern weapon take quite a long time to build what sort of prolonged period do envisage before there can be a summit conference and do think that there can be any new initiative on the ground of nuclear disarmament uh nuclear control or weapon control uh during this period mr kennedy well think should strengthen conventional force and should attempt in january,|february and march|of|next|year to increase the airlift capacity of conventional force then believe that should move full time on missile production particularly on minuteman and on polaris may be a long period but must must get start immediately now on the question of disarmament particularly nuclear disarmament must say that feel that another effort should be make by a new administration in january|of|1961 to renew negotiation with the|soviet|union and see whether be possible to come to some conclusion which will lessen the chance of contamination of the atmosphere and also lessen the chance that other power will begin to possess a nuclear capacity there be indication because of new invention that or nation will have a nuclear capacity include red|china by the end of the presidential office in this be extremely serious there have be many war in the history of mankind and to take a chance uh now be and not make every effort that could make to provide for some control over these weapon think would be a great mistake of disagreement with the present administration have be that do not feel a real effort have be make an this very sensitive subject not only of nuclear control but also of general disarmament less|than|a|hundred people have be work throughout the entire federal government on this subject and believe be be reflect in success and failure at geneva now may not succeed the|soviet|union may not agree to an inspection system may be able to get satisfactory assurance may be necessary for to begin test again but hope the next administration and if have anything to do with the next administration will make last great effort to provide for control of nuclear testing control of nuclear weapon if possible control of outer space free from weapon and also to begin again the subject of general disarmament level these must be do if can not succeed then must strengthen but would make the effort because think the fate not only of own civilization but think the fate of world and the future of the human race be involve in prevent a nuclear war mr shadel mr. vice president comment mr nixon yes be go to make a major speech on this whole subject next|week before the next debate and will have an opportunity then to answer any other question that may arise with regard to position on there be not any question but that must move forward in every possible way to reduce the danger of war to move toward control disarmament to control test but also let have in mind this when senator kennedy suggest that have not be make an effort simply do not know what be talk about be not a question of the number of people who be work in an administration be a question of who be this have be of the high level operation in the whole state|department right under the president have go certainly the extra mile and then some in make offer to the|soviet|union on control of test on disarmament and in every other way and just want to make thing very clear yes should make a great effort but under no circumstance must the united|states ever make an agreement base on trust there must be an absolute guarantee now just a comment on senator kennedy 's last answer forget that in this same debate on the formosa resolution which say vote for which do that vote against an amendment or be record against an amendment and on this particular or for an amendment should say which pass the senate overwhelmingly to and that amendment put the senate of the|united|state on record with a majority of the senator 's own party voting for as well as the majority of republicans put on record against the very position that the senator take now of surrendering of indicate in advance that the|united|state will not defend the offshore island mr shadel the next question be by mr. drummond for vice president nixon mr drummond mr. nixon would like to ask eh more aspect or raise another aspect of this same question uh be understanding that president eisenhower never advocate that quemoy and matsu should be defend under all circumstance as a matter of principle hear secretary dulles at a press conference in say that think that be a mistake for chiang|kai shek to deploy troop to these island would like to ask what have lead to take what appear to be a different position on this subject mr nixon well mr. drummond first of all refer to secretary dulles ' press conference think if read all and know that have will find that secretary dulles also indicate in that press conference that when the troop be withdraw from quemoy that the implication be certainly of everything that say that quemoy could better be defend there be too many infantryman there not enough heavy artillery and certainly do not think there be any implication in secretary dulles ' statement that quemoy and matsu should not be defend in the event that be attack and that attack be a preliminary to an attack on formosa now as far as president eisenhower be concern have often hear discuss this question as uh relate a moment ago the president have always indicate that must not make the mistake in deal with the dictator of indicate that be go to make a concession at the point of a gun whenever do that inevitably the dictator be encourage to try again so first will be quemoy and matsu next may be formosa what do do then point be this that once do this follow this course of action of indicate that be not go to defend a particular area the inevitable result be that encourage a man who be determined to conquer the world to press to the point of no return and that mean war go through this tragic experience lead to world|war|ii learn lesson again in korea must not learn again that be why think the senate be right include a majority of the democrats a majority of the republicans when reject senator kennedy 's position in and incidentally senator johnson be among those who reject that position vote with the against the twelve the senate be right because know the lesson of history and may say too that would trust that senator kennedy would change position on this change because as long as as a major presidential candidate continue to suggest that be go to turn over these island be only encourage the aggressor the chinese communist and the soviet aggressor to press the|united|state to press to the point where war would be inevitable the road to war be always pave with good intention and in this instance the good intention of course be a desire for peace but certainly be not go to have peace by give in and indicate in advance that be not go to defend what have become a symbol of freedom mr shadel senator kennedy mr kennedy do not think be possible for mr. nixon to state the record in distortion of the fact with more precision than just do in mr. dulles at a press conference say the treaty that have with the|republic|of|china exclude quemoy and matsu from the treaty area that be do with much thought and deliberation therefore that treaty do not commit the|united|state to defend anything except formosa and the pescadore and to deal with act against that treaty area completely sustain the treaty vote for would take any action necessary to defend the treaty formosa and what be now talk about be the vice president 's determination to guarantee quemoy and matsu which be four|and|five|mile off the coast of red|china which be not within the treaty area do not suggest that chiang|kai shek and this administration have be attempt since to persuade chiang|kai shek to lessen troop commitment uh send a mission the president in of mr. uh|-|robertson and admiral radford general twining say be still do in general ridgway say who be chief of staff to go to war for quemoy and matsu to would seem an unwarranted and tragic course to take to that concept be completely repugnant so stand with stand with the secretary of state mr. herter who say these island be indefensible believe that should meet commitment and if the chinese communists attack the pescadore and formosa know that will mean a war would not ho- hand over these island under any point of gun but merely say that the treaty be quite precise and sustain the treaty mr. nixon would add a guarantee to island five|mile off the coast of the re- republic of china when be never really protest the communists seize cuba ninety|miles off the coast of the|united|state mr shadel mr. von|fremd have a question for senator kennedy mr von fremd senator kennedy would like to uh shift the conversation if may to a domestic uh political argument the chairman of the|republican|national|committee senator thruston|morton declare earlier|this|week that owe vice president nixon and the republican party a public apology for some strong charge make by former president harry|truman who bluntly suggest where the vice president and the republican party could go do feel that owe the vice president an apology mr kennedy well must say that uh mr. truman have uh method of express thing be be in politic for fifty|year be be president of the|united|state may be not style but really do not think there be anything that could say to president truman that be go to cause at to change particular speaking manner perhaps mrs. truman can but do not think can will just have to tell mr. morton that if would pass that message on to mr shadel any comment mr. vice president mr nixon yes think so of course both er senator kennedy and have feel mr. truman 's ire and uh consequently think can speak with some feeling on this subject just do want to say thing however all have temper have be sure senator kennedy have but when a man 's president of the|united|state or a former president have an obligation not to lose temper in public thing have note as have travel around the country be the tremendous number of child who come out to see the presidential candidate see mother hold baby up so that can see a man who may be president of the|united|state know senator kennedy see too make realize that whoever be president be go to be a man that all the child of america will either look up to or will look down to and can only say that be very proud that president eisenhower restore dignity and decency and frankly good language to the conduct of the presidency of the|united|state and only hope that should win this election that could approach president eisenhower in maintain the dignity of the office in see to that whenever any mother or father talk to child can look at the man in the|white|house and whatever may think of policy will say well there be a man who maintain the kind of standard personally that would want child to follow mr shadel mr. cater 's question be for vice president nixon mr cater mr. vice president would like to return just once more if may to this area of deal with the communists critic have claim that on occasion in recent|years on the sending of american troop to indochina in on the matter of continue the u-2 flight uh in may and then on this definition of the of commitment to the offshore island that have overstate the administration position that have take a more bellicose position than president eisenhower say that call on uh senator kennedy to serve notice to communist aggressor around the world that be not go to retreat one|inch more any place where as do retreat from the|tachen|island or at least chiang|kai shek do would say this be a valid criticism of statement of foreign policy mr nixon well mr. cater of course be a criticism that uh be be make uh obviously do not think be valid have support the administration 's position and think that that position have be correct think position have be correct as far as indochina be concern state over and over again that be essential during that period that the|united|state make clear that would not tolerate indochina fall under communist domination now as a result of take the strong stand that do the civil war there be end and today at least in the south of indochina the communists have move out and do have a strong free bastion there now look to the u-2 flight would like to point out that have be support the president 's position throughout think the president be correct in order these flight think the president be correct certainly in decision to continue the flight while the conference be go on note for example in read a uh a a particular discussion that senator kennedy have with dave|garroway shortly after the uh statement about regret that uh make the statement that feel that these particular flight uh be one that should not have occur right at that time and the indication be how would mr. khrushchev have feel if have uh have a flight over the uni- how would have feel if mr. khrushchev ha uh have a flight over the|united|state while uh be visit here and the answer of course be that communist espionage go on all the time the answer be that the|united|states can not afford to have a es- an a espionage lack or should s- uh lag or should say uh an intelligence lag any more than can afford to have a missile lag now refer to question with regard to quemoy and matsu what object to here be the constant reference to surrender these island senator kennedy quote the record which read from a|moment|ago but what forget to point out be that the key vote a uh vote which have refer to several time where be in the minority be which reject position now why do reject for the very reason that those senator know as the president of the|united|state know that should not indicate to the communists in advance that be go to surrender an area that be free why because know as senator kennedy will have to know that if do that encourage to more aggression mr shadel senator kennedy mr kennedy well number on indochina mr. nixon talk in before the newspaper editor in the|spring|of|1954 about put and quote american boy into indochina the reason indochina be preserve be the result of the|geneva|conference which indochina number on the question of the u-2 flight think the u-2 flight in may just before the conference be a mistake in timing because of the hazard involve if the summit conference have any hope for success never criticize the u-2 flight in general however never suggest espionage should stop still go on would assume on both side number the vice president on may|fifteenth after the u-2 flight indicate that the flight be go on even though the administration and the president have cancel the flight on may|twelfth number the pre - vice president suggest that should keep the communists in doubt about whether would fight on quemoy and matsu that be not the position be take be indicate that should fight for these island come what may because be in word in the area of freedom do not take that position on tibet do not take that position on budapest do not take that position that have see so far in laos guinea and ghana have both move within the soviet sphere of influence in foreign policy so have cuba merely say that the|united|states should meet commitment to que- to uh formosa and the pescadore but as admiral yarnell have say and be be support by most military authority these island that be now talk about be not worth the bone of a single american soldier and know how difficult be to sustain troop close to the shore under artillery bombardment and therefore think should make very clear the disagreement between mr. nixon and be extend the administration 's commitment mr shadel mr. drummond 's question be for senator kennedy mr drummond uh mr. kennedy representative adam|clayton|powell in the course of speak tour in behalf be say and quote the|ku|klux|klan be rid again in this campaign if do not stop all bigot will vote for nixon and all right think christians and jews will vote for kennedy rather than be find in the rank of the klan minded end quotation governor michael|disalle be say much the same thing what would like to ask senator kennedy be what be the purpose of this sort of thing and how do feel about mr kennedy well the que- the mr. griffin believe who be the head of the klan who live in tampa florida indicate a in a statement think two|or|three|weeks|ago that be not go to vote for and that be go to vote for mr. nixon do not suggest in any way nor have ever that that indicate that mr. nixon have the slight sympathy involvement or in any way imply any inference in regard to the|ku|klux|klan that be absurd do not suggest that do not support would disagree with mr. nixon know very well that in this in this whole matter that be be involve with the so call religious discussion in this campaign have never suggest even by the vague implication that do anything but disapprove and that be view now disapprove of the issue do not suggest that mr. nixon do in any way mr shadel mr. vice president mr nixon well welcome this opportunity to join senator kennedy completely on that statement and to say before this large television audience in history something that have be say in the past and want to will always say in the future on last television debate point out that be position that americans must choose the good man that either party could produce can not settle for anything but the good and that mean of course the good man that this nation can produce and that mean that can not have any test of religion can not have any test of race must be a test of a man also as far as religion be concern have see communism abroad see what do communism be the enemy of all religion and who do believe in god must join together must not be divide on this issue the bad thing that can think can happen in this campaign would be for to be decide on religious issue obviously repudiate the klan repudiate anybody who use the religious issue will not tolerate have order all of people to have nothing to do with and say say to this great audience whoever may be listen remember if believe in america if want america to set the right example to the world that can not have religious or racial prejudice can not have in heart but certainly can not have in a presidential campaign mr shadel mr. mcgee have a question for vice president nixon mr mcgee mr. vice president some of early campaign literature say be make a study to see if new law be need to protect the public against excessive use of power by labor union have decide whether such new law be need and if so what would do mr nixon mr. mcgee be plan a speech on that subject next|week uh also so that can get the uh opportunity for the questioner to question will be before the next television debate uh will say simply in advance of that believe that in this area the law which should be pass uh as far as the big national emergency strike be concern be one that will give the president more weapon with which to deal with those strike now have a basic disagreement with senator kennedy though on this point have take the position when first indicate in october|of|last|year that would even favor compulsory arbitration as of the weapon the president may have to stop a national emergency strike understand in last speech before the|steelworkers|union that change that position and indicate that feel that government seizure may be the good way to stop a strike which could not be settle by collective bargaining do not believe should have either compulsory arbitration or seizure think the moment that give to the union on the side and to management on the other side the escape hatch of eventually go to government to get settle that most of these great strike will end up be settle by government and that will be a be in the end in opinion wage control would mean price control all the thing that do not want do believe however that can give to the president of the united|states power in addition to what presently have in the fact find area which would enable to be more effective than have be in handle these strike last point should make the record in handle have be very good during this administration have have less man hour lose by strike in these|last|seven|year than have in the|previous|seven|years by a great deal and only want to say that however good the record be be get to be well because in this critical year period of the sixty have get to move forward all americans must move forward together and have to get the great cooperation possible between labor and management can not afford stoppage of massive effect on the economy when be in the terrible competition be in with the soviets mr shadel senator comment mr kennedy well always have difficulty recognize position when be state by the vice president never suggest that compulsory arbitration be the solution for national emergency dispute be opposed to that be oppose to in october,|1958 have suggest that the president should be give other weapon to protect the national interest in case of national emergency strike beyond the injunction provision of the|taft hartley|act do not know what other weapon the vice president be talk about be talk about give four|or|five tool not only the fact find committee that now have under the injunction provision not only the injunction but also the power of the fact find commission to make recommendation recommendation which would not be bind but nevertheless would have great force of public opinion behind of the additional power that would suggest would be seizure there may be other by the president have power or power and only have very limit power today neither the company nor the union would be sure which power would be use and therefore there would be a great incentive on both side to reach an agreement without take to the government the difficulty now be the president 's course be quite limited can set up a fact find committee the fact find committee 's power be limit can provide an injunction if there be a national emergency for eighty|days then the strike can go on and there be no other power or action that the president could take unless go to the congress this be a difficult and sensitive matter but to state view precisely the president should have a variety of thing could do could leave the party in doubt as to which one would use and therefore there would be incentive instead of as now the steel company be ready to take the strike because feel the injunction of eighty|days would break the union which do not happen mr shadel the next question be by mr. cater for senator kennedy mr cater uh mr. kennedy uh senator uh vice president nixon say that have cost the party platform and that would run at|least|ten|billion|dollar a year more than have deny figure have call on to supply figure would do that mr kennedy yes have state in both uh debate and state again that believe in a balanced budget and have support that concept during fourteen|years in the congress the only time when an unbalanced budget be warrant would be during a serious recession and have that in in an unbalanced budget of twelve|billion|dollars or a national emergency where there should be large expenditure for national defense which have in world|war|ii and uh during part of on the question of the cost of budget have state that be good judgment that agricultural program will cost a|billion|and|a|half possibly two|billion|dollars less than the present agricultural program judgment be that the program the vice president put forward which be an extension of mr. benson 's program will cost a|billion|dollar more than the present program which cost about|six|billion|dollars a year the most expensive in history have spend more money on agriculture in the|last|eight|years|than|the|hundred|year of the|agricultural|department before that secondly believe that the high interest rate policy that this administration have follow have add about|three|billion|dollar a year to interest on the debt merely fund the debt which be a burden an the taxpayer would hope under a different monetary policy that would be possible to reduce that interest rate burden at|least|a|billion|dollars third think be possible to gain a seven|hundred|million to a dollar through tax change which believe would close up loof- loophole on dividend withholding on expense account fourthly have suggest that the medical care for the age and the bill which the congress now have pass and the president sign if fully implement would cost a|billion|dollar on the treasury out of treasury fund and by the state the proposal that have put forward and which many of the member of party support be for medical care finance under social|security which would be finance under the social|security taxis which be less|than|three|cent a day per person for medical care doctor ' bill nurse hospital when retire be actuarially sound so in judgment would spend more money in this administration on aid to education would spend more money on housing would spend more money and hope more wisely on defense than this administration have but believe that the next administration should work for a balanced budget and that would be intention mr. nixon misstate figure constantly which uh be of course right but the fact of the matter be here be where stand and just want to have on the public record mr shadel mr. vice president mr nixon senator kennedy have indicate on several occasion in this program tonight that have be misstate record and figure will issue a white paper after this broadcast quote exactly what say on compulsory arbitration for example and the record will show that have be correct now as far as figure be concern here tonight again be engage in this what would call mirror game of here be and here isn't uh on the hand for example suggest that as far as medical care program be concern that that really be not a problem because be from social|security but social|security be a tax the people pay come right out of paycheck this do not mean that the people be not go to be pay the bill also indicate as far as agricultural program be concern that feel will cost less than ours well all that can suggest be that all the expert who have study the program indicate that be the most fantastic program the bad program insofar as effect on the farmer that the america have ever have foist upon in an|election|year or any other time and would also point out that senator kennedy leave out a part of the cost of that program a five|percent rise in food price that the people would have to pay now be go to have that when be not go to help the farmer do not think should have that kind of a program then go on to say that be go to change the interest rate situation and be go to get some more money that way well what be say there in effect be go to have inflation be go to go right back to what have under mr. truman when have political control of the|federal|reserve|board do not believe ought to pay bill through inflation through a phony interest rate mr shadel next mr. drummond 's question for vice president nixon mr drummond uh mr. nixon uh before the convention and governor rockefeller say jointly that the nation 's economic growth ought to be accelerate and the republican platform state that uh the nation need to quicken the pace of economic growth uh be fair therefore mr. vice president to conclude that feel that there have be insufficient economic growth during the|past|eight|years and if so what would do beyond uh present administration policy uh to step up mr nixon mr. drummond be never satisfied with the economic growth of this country be not satisfied with even if there be no communism in the world but particularly when be in the kind of a race be in have get to see that america grow just as fast as can provide grow soundly because even though have maintain as point out in first debate the absolute gap over the|soviet|union even though the growth in this administration have be twice as much as be in the|truman|administration that be not good enough because america must be able to grow enough not only to take care of need at home for well education and housing and health all these thing want have get to grow enough to maintain the force that have abroad and to wage the non - military battle for the war uh for the world in asia in africa and latin|america be go to cost more money and growth will help to win that battle now what do do about and here believe basically that what have to do be to stimulate that sector of america the private enterprise sector of the economy in which there be the great possibility for expansion so that be why advocate a program of tax reform which will stimulate more investment in economy in addition to that have to move on other area that be hold back growth refer for example to distressed area have to move into those area with program so that make adequate use of the resource of those area also have to see that all of the people of the|united|state the tremendous talent that people have be use adequately that be why in this whole area of civil right the equality of opportunity for employment and education be not just for the benefit of the minority group be for the benefit of the nation so that can get the scientist and the engineer and all the rest that need and in addition to that need program particularly in high education which will stimulate scientific breakthrough which will bring more growth now what all this of course add up to be this america have not be stand still let get that straight anybody who say america be be stand still for the|last|seven|and|a|half|year have not be travel around america be be travel in some other country have be move have be move much faster than do in the truman year but can and must move faster and that be why stand so strongly for program that will move america forward in the|sixty move forward so that can stay ahead of the|soviet|union and win the battle for freedom and peace mr shadel senator kennedy mr kennedy well first may correct a statement which be make before that under agricultural program food price would go up five|percent that be untrue the fa- the farmer who grow wheat get a half cent out of a cent loaf of bread even if put income up ten|percent that would be and quarter percent pers- or three|cent out of that five|cent the man who grow tomato cost less for those tomato than do for the label on the can and believe when for many farmer ' wage be about|fifty|cents an hour should do better but anybody who suggest that that program would come to any figure indicate by the vice president be in error the vice president suggest a number of thing suggest that aid distressed area the administration have veto that bill pass by the congress twice suggest pass an aid to education bill but the administration and the republican majority in the congress have oppose any realistic aid to education and the vice president cast the decide vote against federal aid for teacher ' salary in the senate which prevent that be add this administration and this country last|year have the low rate of economic growth which mean job of any major industrialized society in the world in and when have to find five|thousand new job a week for the|next|ten|year be go to have to grow more governor rockefeller say five|per|cent the democratic platform and other say five|per|cent many say four|and|a|half per cent the|last|eight|year the average growth have be about|two|and|a|half per cent that be why do not have full employment today mr shadel mr. mcgee have the next question for senator kennedy mr mcgee uh senator kennedy a moment ago mention tax loophole now running mate senator lyndon|johnson be from texas an oil produce state and one that many political leader feel be in doubt in this|election|year and report from there say that oil man in texas be seek assurance from senator johnson that the oil depletion allowance will not be cut the democratic platform pledge to plug hole in the tax law and refer to inequitable depletion allowance as be conspicuous loophole question be do consider the seven|and|a|half per cent depletion allowance inequitable and would ask that be cut mr kennedy uh mr. mcgee there be about|a|hundred|and|four commodity that have some kind of depletion allowance different kind of mineral include oil believe all of those should be go over in detail to make sure that no one be get a tax break to make sure that no one be get away from pay the taxis ought to pay that include oil include all kind of mineral include everything within the range of taxation want to be sure be fair and equitable include oil abroad perhaps that oil abroad should be treat differently than the oil here at home now the oil industry recently have have hard time particularly some of the small producer be move in texas but can assure that if be elect president the whole spectrum of taxis will be go through carefully and if there be any inequity in oil or any other commodity then would vote to close that loophole have vote in the past to reduce the depletion allowance for the large producer for those from five|million|dollars down to maintain at seven|and|a|half per cent believe should study this and other allowance tax expense dividend expense and all the rest and make a determination of how can stimulate growth how can provide the revenue need to move country forward mr shadel mr. vice president mr nixon senator kennedy 's position and completely different on this favor the present depletion allowance favor not because want to make a lot of oil man rich but because want to make america rich why do have a depletion allowance because this be the stimulation the incentive for company to go out and explore for oil to develop if do not have a depletion allowance of certainly believe the present amount would have oil exploration cut substantially in this country now as far as position then be concern be exactly opposite to the senator 's and be because of belief that if america be go to have the growth that talk about and that talk about and that want the thing to do be not to discourage individual enterprise not to discourage people to go out and discover more oil and mineral but to encourage and so would be do exactly the wrong thing other thing suggest that there be a number of other item in this whole depletion field that could be take into account also say a moment ago that would get more money to finance program by revise the tax law include depletion should point out that as far as depletion allowance be concern the oil depletion allowance be that provide eighty|percent of all of those involve in depletion so be not go to get much from revenue insofar as depletion allowance be concern unless move in the area that indicate but oppose oppose for the reason that mention oppose because want to have more oil exploration and not less mr shadel gentleman if may remind time be grow short so please keep question and answer as brief as possible consistent with clarity mr. von|fremd for vice president nixon mr von fremd mr. vice president in the|past|three|years there have be an exodus of more|than|four|billion|dollar of gold from the|united|state apparently for reason because export have slump and have not cover import and because of increase american investment abroad if be president how would go about stop this departure of gold from shore mr nixon well mr. von|fremd the first thing have to do be to continue to keep confidence abroad in the american dollar that mean that must continue to have a balanced budget here at home in every possible circumstance that can because the moment that have loss of confidence in own fiscal policy at home result in gold flow out secondly have to increase export as compare with import and here have a very strong program go forward in the|department|of|commerce this one must be step up beyond that as far as the gold supply be concern and as far as the movement of gold be concern uh have to bear in mind that must get more help from ally abroad in this great venture in which all free man be involve of win the battle for freedom now america have be carry a tremendous load in this respect think have be right in carry have favor program abroad for economic assistance and for military assistance but now find that the country of europe for example that have aid and japan that have aid in the|far|east these country some former enemy have now recover completely have get to bear a great share of this load of economic assistance abroad that be why be advocate and will develop during the course of the next administration if of course get the opportunity a program in which enlist more aid from these other country on a concerted basis in the program of economic development for africa asia and the|united|state can not continue to carry the major share of this burden by can a big share of but have get to have more help from friend abroad and these factor think will be very helpful in reverse the gold flow which speak about mr shadel senator kennedy mr kennedy just to uh correct the record mr. nixon say on depletion that record be the opposite of mine what say be that this matter should be thoroughly go into to make sure that there be not loophole if record be the opposite of that that mean that do not want to go into now on the question of gold the difficulty of course be that do have heavy obligation abroad that therefore have to maintain not only a favorable balance of trade but also send a good deal of dollar overseas to pay troop maintain basis and sustain other economy in other word if be go to continue to maintain position in the|sixty have to maintain a sound monetary and fiscal policy have to have control over inflation and also have to have a favorable balance of trade have to be able to compete in the world market have to be able to sell abroad more than consume uh from abroad if be go to be able to meet obligation in addition many of the country around the world still keep restriction against goad go all the way back to the|days when there be a dollar shortage now there be not a dollar shortage and yet many of these country continue to move against good believe that must be able to compete in the market steel and in all the basic commodity abroad must be able to compete against because always do because of technological lead have to be sure to maintain that have to persuade these other country not to restrict good come in not to act as if there be a dollar gap and third have to persuade to assume some of the responsibility that up till now have maintain to assist underdeveloped country in africa latin|america and asia make an economic breakthrough on own mr shadel mr. drummond 's question now for senator kennedy mr drummond senator kennedy a question on american prestige in light of the fact that the soviet ambassador be recently expel from the congo and that mr. khrushchev have this|week cancel trip to cuba for fear of stirring resentment throughout all latin|america would like to ask to spell out somewhat more fully how think should measure american prestige to determine whether be rise or whether be fall mr kennedy well think there be many uh test mr. drummond of prestige and the significance of prestige really be because be so identify with the cause of freedom therefore if be on the mount if be rise if influence be spread if prestige be spread then those uh who stand now on the razor edge of decision between or between the communist system wonder whether should use the system of freedom to develop country or the system of communism will be persuade to follow example there have be several indication that prestige be not as high as once be mr. george|allen the head of information service say that a result of be second in space in the sputnik in and quote believe paraphrase accurately say that many of these country equate space development with scientific productivity and scientific advancement and therefore say many of these country now feel that the|soviet|union which be once so backward be now on a par with the|united|state secondly the economic growth of the|soviet|union be great than ours mr. dulles have suggest be from two|to|three time as great as ours this have a great effect on the underdeveloped world which face problem of low income and high population density and inadequate resource a gallup poll take in february ask people in country which country think would be first in both scientifically and militarily and a majority in every country except greece feel that would be the|soviet|union by l970 in the vote at the u.n. particularly the vote deal with red china last|saturday receive the support on the position that have take of only|two african country liberia which have be tie to for more|than|a|century and the other union|of|south|africa which be not a popular country in africa every other african country either abstain or vote against a more country vote against in asia on this issue than vote with on the neutralist ' resolution

of the castro supporter uh within brazil there be many indication guinea and ghana independent country within guinea in ghana within both now be support the soviet foreign policy at the u.n. mr. herter say so laos be move in that direction so would say prestige be not so high no longer do give the image of be on the rise no longer do give an image of vitality mr shadel mr. vice president mr nixon well would say first of all that senator 's kennedy 's statement that be just make be not go to help gallup poll abroad and be not go to help prestige either let look at the other side of the coin let look at the vote on the congo the vote be to nothing against the|soviet|union let look at the situation with regard to economic growth as really be find that the|soviet|union be a very primitive economy growth rate be not what count be whether be catch up with and be not catch up with be well ahead and can stay ahead provide have confidence in america and do not run down in order to build up could look also at other item which senator kennedy have name but will only conclude by say this in this whole matter of prestige in the final analysis whether stand for what be right and get back to this matter that discuss at the outset the matter of quemoy and matsu can think of nothing that will be a great blow to the prestige of the|united|state among the free nation in asia than for to take senator kennedy 's advan- advice to go go against what a majority of the member of the senate both democrat and republican do say in and to say in advance will surrender an area to the communists in other word if the|united|state be go to maintain strength and prestige must not only be strong militarily and economically must be firm diplomatically thi- certainly have be speak know

include a newspaperman and a wire service representative these be select by lot by the press secretary of the candidate from among the reporter travel with the candidate the broadcasting representative be select by respective company the reporter be paul|niven of cbs edward|p.|morgan of abc alvin|spivak of united|press|international and harold|r.|levy of newsday now the first question be from mr. niven and be for vice president nixon mr niven mr. vice president senator kennedy say last|night that the administration must take responsibility for the loss of cuba would compare the validity of that statement with the validity of own statement in previous campaign that the|truman|administration be responsible for the loss of china to the communists mr nixon well first of all do not agree with senator kennedy that cuba be lose and certainly china be lose when this administration come into power in as look at cuba today believe that be follow the right course a course which be difficult but a course which under the circumstance be the only proper one which will see that the cuban people get a chance to realize aspiration of progress through freedom and that get that with cooperation with the other organi- of the state in the|organization|of|american|state now senator kennedy have make some very strong criticism of part or allege part in what have happen in cuba point to the fact that visit cuba while mr. batista be in power there can only point out that if be go to judge the administrations in term of attitude toward dictator be glad to have a comparison with the previous administration there be dictator in and in central|america when come in in today there be only|three leave include the one in cuba think that be pretty good progress senator kennedy also indicate with regard to cuba that think that have make a mistake when be in cuba in not call for free election in that country now be very surprised that senator kennedy who be on the|foreign|relations|committee would have make such a statement as this kind as a matter of fact in book the|strategy|for|peace take the right position and that position be that the|united|states have a treaty a treaty with all of the|organization|of|american|states which prohibit from interfere in the internal affair of any other state and prohibit as well for to have make such a statement would be in direct uh opposition to that treaty now with regard to cuba let make thing clear there be not any question but that will defend right there there be not any question but that will defend guantanamo if be attack there also be not any question but that the free people of cuba the people who want to be free be go to be support and that will attain freedom no cuba be not lose and do not think this kind of defeatist talk by senator kennedy help the situation bit mr mcgee senator kennedy would care to comment mr kennedy in the first place have never suggest that cuba be lose except for the present in speech last|night indicate that think that cuba one|day again would be free where have be critical of the administration 's policy and where criticize mr. nixon be because in press conference in havana in praise the competence and stability of the bicta- bict- batista dictatorship that dictatorship have kill over twenty|thousand cubans in seven|years secondly do not criticize for not call for free election what criticize be the failure of the administration to use great influence to persuade the cuban government to hold free election particularly in and thirdly arthur|gardner a republican ambassador earl|smith a republican ambassador in succession both have indicate in the|past|six|week that report to washington that castro be a marxist that raul|castro be a communist and that get no effective result instead aid continue to batista which be ineffective never be on the side of freedom never use influence when could have use most effectively and today cuba be lose for freedom hope some day will rise but do not think will rise if continue the same policy toward cuba that do in recent|years and in fact towards all of latin|america when have almost ignore the need of latin|america have beam not a single voice|of|america program in spanish to all of in the|last|eight|years except for the|three|month of the hungarian uh revolution mr mcgee mr. morgan with a question for senator kennedy mr morgan senator last|may in oregon discuss the possibility of send apology or regret to khrushchev over the u-2 incident do think now that that would have do any good do think so then mr kennedy mr. morgan suggest that if the|united|states feel that could save the summit conference that would have be proper for to have express regret in judgment that statement have be distort uh by mr. nixon and other in debate around the country and in discussion mr. lodge on meet|the|press a|month|ago say if there be ever a case when do not have law an side be in the u-2 incident the u-2 flight be proper from the point of view of protect security but be not in accordance with international law and say that feel that rather than tell the lie which tell rather than indicate that the flight would continue in fact believe mr. nixon say on may|fifteenth that the flight would continue even though mr. herter testify before the|senate|foreign|relations|committee that have be cancel as of may twelfth that would have be far well that if have express regret if that would have save the summit and if the summit be useful and believe be the point that be always leave out be the fact that express regret to castro this|winter that express regret the|eisenhower|administration express regret for a flight over southern|russia in express regret for a flight over eastern|germany under this administration the|soviet|union in express regret to over the|bering|sea incident the chinese communists express regret to over a plane incident in that be the accept procedure between nation and judgment be that should follow the advice of theodore|roosevelt be strong maintain a strong position but also speak softly believe that in those case where international custom call for the expression of a regret if that would have keep the summit go in judgment be a proper action be not appeasement be not soft believe should be strong than now be believe should have a strong military force believe should increase strength all over the world but do not confuse word with strength and in judgment if the summit be useful if would have bring closer to peace that rather than the lie that tell which have be criticize by all responsible people afterwards would have be far well for to follow the common diplomatic procedure of express regret and then try to move on mr mcgee mr. vice president mr nixon think kenne- senator kennedy be wrong on count first of all be wrong in think even suggest that mr. khrushchev may have continue the conference if have express regret know these flight be go on long before and that be not the reason that break up the conference second be wrong in the analogy that make the|united|state be a strong country whenever do anything that be wrong can express regret but when the president of the|united|state be do something that be right something that be for the purpose of defend the security of this country against surprise attack can never express regret or apologize to anybody include mr. khrushchev now in that connection senator kennedy have criticize the president on the ground not only of not express regret but because allow this flight to take place while the summit conference or immediately before the summit conference occur this seem to be criticism that again be wrong on part all remember pearl|harbor lose three|thousand american life can not afford an intelligence gap and just want to make position absolutely clear with regard to get intelligence information do not intend to see to that the|united|states be ever in a position where while be negotiate with the|soviet|union that discontinue intelligence effort and do not intend ever to express regret to mr. khrushchev or anybody else if be do something that have the support of the congress and that be right for the purpose of protect the security of the|united|state mr mcgee mr. spivak with a question for vice president nixon mr spivak mr. vice president have accuse senator kennedy of avoid the civil right issue when have be in the south and have accuse of the same thing with both north and south listen and watch would sum up uh own intention in the field of civil right if become president mr nixon intention in the field of civil right have be spell out in the republican platform think have to make progress first in the field of employment and there would give statutory authority to the|committee|on|government|contract which be an effective way of get real progress make in this area since about|one out of every job be hold by and be allot by people who have government contract certainly think all of agree that when anybody have a government contract certainly the money that be spend under that contract ought to be disburse equally without regard to the race or creed or color of the individual who be to be employ second in the field of school believe that there should be provision whereby the federal government would give assistance to those district who do want to integrate school that of course be reject as be the government contract provision by the special session of the congress to in which mr. kennedy be quite active and then as far as other area be concern think that have to look to presidential leadership and when speak of presidential leadership refer for example to attitude on the sit in strike here have a situation which cause all of concern cause concern because of the denial of the right of people to the equality which think belong to everybody have talk to negro mother have hear explain try to explain how tell child how can go into a store and buy a loaf of bread but then can not go into that store and sit at the counter and get a|coca|cola this be wrong and have to do something about so under the circumstance what do do well what do be what the attorney general of the|united|state do under the direction of the president call in the owner of chain store and get to take action now there be other place where the executive can lead but let just sum up by say this why do talk every time be in the south on civil right not because be preach to the people of the south because this be not just a southern problem be a northern problem and a western problem be a problem for all of do because be the responsibility of leadership do because have to solve this problem together do right at this time particularly because when have khrushchev in this country a man who have enslave million a man who have slaughter thousand can not continue to have a situation where can point the finger at and say that be deny right to citizen and so say both the candidate and both the vice presidential candidate would hope as well include senator johnson should talk on this issue at every opportunity mr mcgee senator kennedy mr kennedy well mr. nixon have not discuss the basic question what be go to be do and what will be policy on implement the decision of give aid to school technically that be try to carry out the decision be not the great question secondly what be go to do to provide fair employment be be the head of the|committee|on|government|contract that be carry out case both in have not indicate support of an attempt to provide fair employment practice around the country so that everyone can get a job regardless of race or color nor have indicate that will support which would give the attorney general additional power to protect constitutional right these be the great question equality of education in school about|two|percent of population of white people be be illiterate ten|per|cent of colored population to seventy|percent of colored child do not finish high school these be the question in these area that the|north|and|south east and west be entitle to know what will be the leadership of the president in these area to provide equality of opportunity for employment equality of opportunity in the field of housing which could be do on all federal support housing by a stroke of the president 's pen what will be do to provide equality of education in all section of the|united|state those be the question to which the president must establish a moral tone and moral leadership and can assure that if be elect president will do so mr mcgee mr. levy with a question for senator kennedy mr levy senator on the same subject in the past have emphasize the president 's responsibility as a moral leader as well as an executive on civil right question what specifically may the next president do uh in the event of an uh an occurrence such as little|rock or the lunch counter sit in from the standpoint of mr kennedy well let say that think that the president operate in a number of different area first as a legislative leader and as just say that believe that the passage of the so call which give the attorney general the power to protect constitutional right in those case where be not possible for the person involve to bring the suit secondly as an executive leader there have be only|six case bring by this attorney general under the voting bill pass in and the voting bill pass in the right to vote be basic do not believe that this administration have implement those bill which represent the will of the majority of the congress on occasion with vigor thirdly do not believe that the government contract division be operate with vigor everyone who do business with the government should have the opportunity to make sure that do not practice discrimination in hiring and that be in all section of the|united|state and then fourthly as a moral leader there be a very strong moral basis for this concept of equality of opportunity be in a very difficult time need all the talent can get sit on a conspicuous stage be a goldfish bowl before the world have to practice what preach set a very high standard for the communists do not set a low standard of materialism preach in the|declaration|of|independence and in the constitution in the statement of great leader preach very high standard and if be not go to be charge before the world with hypocrisy have to meet those standard believe the president of the|united|state should indicate now lastly believe in the case of little|rock would have hope that the president of the|united|state would have be possible for to indicate clearly that uh the decision be go to be carry out would have hope that would have be possible to use marshal to do so but wou- uh evidently uh under the handling of the case be not would hope an incident like that would not happen think if the president be responsible if consult with those involve if make clear that the supreme|court decision be go to be carry out in a way that the|supreme|court plan with deliberate speed then in judgment provide be behind action believe can make uh progress now the present administration the president have say never indicate what think of the decision unless the president speak then of course uh the country do not speak and franklin|roosevelt say the pre uh the presidency of the|united|state be above all a place of moral leadership and believe on this great moral issue should speak out and give view clearly mr mcgee mr. vice president mr nixon senator kennedy have express some hope in this field hope which think all americans would share who want some problem some progress in this area but let look at the performance when select vice presidential running mate select a man who have vote against most of these proposal and who oppose at the present time let look also at what do select a man who stand with in this field and who will talk with and work with on now the senator refer to the|committee|on|government|contract and yet that very committee of which be chairman have be handicap by the fact that have not have adequate fund have not have adequate power have not have an adequate staff now in the special session of congress and also in the session that precede the democratic congress in which there be a to democratic majority be ask by the president to give the fund and give the power to do a job and do nothing at all and in the special session in which senator kennedy be call the signal along with senator johnson turn down and vote against give the power despite the fact that the bill have already be consider before that already have hearing on and the congress already know what have before all that can say be this what need here be not just high hope what need be action and in the field of executive leadership can say that believe be essential that the president of the|united|state not only set the tone but also must lead must act as talk mr mcgee mr. morgan with a question for vice president nixon mr morgan mr. vice president in speech emphasize that the|united|states be do basically well in the cold war can square that statement with a considerable mass of bipartisan report and study include prominently participate in by governor rockefeller which almost unanimously conclude that be not do nearly so well as should mr nixon mr. morgan no matter how well be do in the cold war be not do as well as should and that will always be the case as long as the communists be on the international scene in the aggressive tac- uh tendency that presently be follow now as far as the present situation be concern think be time that nail a few of these distortion about the|united|state that have be put out first of all hear that prestige be at an all time low senator kennedy have be hit that point over and over again would suggest that after premier kush- khrushchev 's uh performance in the|united|nation compare with president eisenhower 's eloquent speech that at the present time communist prestige in the world be at an all time low and american prestige be at an all time high now that of course be just factor but be a significant when look for example at the vote on the congo be on side be on the other side what happen there be vote for position and none for look at the vote in the|united|nation over the|past|seven|and|a|half|year that be a test of prestige every time the|united|states have be an side and have be on the other side position have be sustain now look to what ought to do in the future in this cold war have to recognize where be be fight and then have to develop program to deal with be be fight primarily in asia in africa and in what do need what tool do need to fight well need for example economic assistance need technical assistance need exchange need program of diplomatic and other character which will be effective in that area now senator kennedy a moment ago refer to the fact that there be not an adequate voice|of|america program for latin|america would like to point out that in the|last|six|year the|democratic|congresse of which would be a member have cut twenty|million|dollars off of the|voice|of|america program also have cut four|billion|dollars off of mutual security in these|last|six|years also have cut two|billion|dollars off of defense now when talk about record here be well that recognize that have to stand up for record as well so let summarize by say this be not satisfied with what be do in the cold war because believe have to step up activity and launch an offensive for the mind and heart and soul of man must be economic must be technological above all must be ideological but have get to get help from the congress in order to do this mr mcgee senator kennedy mr kennedy of course mr. nixon be wholly inaccurate when say that the congress have not provide more fund in fact than the president recommend for national defense nineteen|fifty try to put an appropriation of five|billion|dollar for defense be responsible for the amendment with senator monroney in to strengthen ground force the|congress|of|the|united|state appropriate dollar mare than the president be willing to use up till a|week|ago secondly on the question of position in the|united|nation all know about the vote hold this week of the neutralist and be generally regard as a defeat for the|united|state thirdly in there be vote in favor of the admission of red|china into the|united|nation last|year there be and tomorrow when the preliminary vote be hold will see a strengthening of that position or very closely to have not maintain position and prestige a gallup poll take in february|of|this|year ask the in out of country ask the people who do think would be ahead by militarily and scientifically and a majority in of the country say the|soviet|union would be by governor rockefeller have be far more critical in june of position in the world than have be the rockefeller|brothers report general ridgway general gavin the|gaither|report various report of congressional committee all indicate that the relative strength of the p- united|stat both militarily politically psychologically and scientifically and industrially the relative strength of the so- of united|stat compare to that of the|soviet|union and the chinese communists together have deteriorate in and should know and the american people should be tell the fact mr mcgee mr. spivak with a question for senator kennedy mr spivak senator uh follow this up how would go about increase the prestige say be lose and could the program have devise to do so be accomplish without absolutely wreck economy mr kennedy yes have be wholly indifferent to latin|america until the|last|few|month the program that be put forward this|summer after break off the sugar quota with cuba really be do because want to get through the o.a.s. meeting a condemnation of russian infiltration of cuba and therefore pass an authorization not an aid bill which be the first time really since the|inter american|bank which be found a|year|ago be develop that really have look at the need of latin|america that have associate with those people secondly believe that in the that be far well for the|united|state instead of concentrate aid particularly in the underdeveloped world on surplus military equipment pour three|hundred|million|dollar of surplus military equipment into laos pay more military aid more aid into laos per per person than in any country in the world and ought to know now that laos be move from neutralism in the direction of the communists believe instead of do that should concentrate aid in long term loan which these people can pay back either in hard money or in local currency this permit to maintain self respect permit to make sure that the project which be invest in be go to produce great wealth and believe that in case of india and africa and latin|america that this be where emphasis should be would strengthen and senator fulbright senator humphrey and try to do that try to provide an appropriation of a|billion|and|a|half for five|years on a long term loan basis which this administration oppose and unless be ready to carry out program like that in the|sixty this battle for economic survival which these people be wag be go to be lose and if india should lose battle with per cent of the people of the underdeveloped world within border then believe that the balance of power could move against think the|united|state can afford to do these thing think that could not afford not to do these thing this go to survival and here in a country which if be move ahead if be develop economy to the full which be not now in judgment will have the resource to meet military commitment and also commitment overseas believe be essential that do because in the|next|ten|year the balance of power be go to begin to move in the world from direction or another towards or towards the communists and unless begin to identify not only with the anti - communist fight but also with the fight against poverty and hunger these people be go to begin to turn to the communists as an example believe can do if build economy the way should can afford to do these thing and must do mr mcgee mr. vice president mr nixon senator kennedy have put a great deal of stress on the necessity for economic assistance this be important but be also tremendously important to bear in mind that when pour in money without pour in technical assistance at as well that have a disastrous situation need to step up exchange need to step up technical assistance so that train people in these newly develop country can operate the economy also have to have in mind something else with regard to this whole situation in the world and that be that as america move forward not only must think in term of fight communism but must also think primarily in term of the interest of these country must associate with aspiration must let know that the great american ideal of independence of the right of people to be free and of the right to progress that these be ideal that belong not to alone but belong to everybody this must get across to the world and can not do unless do have adequate fund for for example information which have be cut by the congress adequate fund for technical assistance the other point that would make with regard to economic assistance and technical assistance be that the|united|states must not rest case here alone this be primarily an ideological battle a battle for the mind and the heart and the soul of man must not meet the communists purely in the field of gross atheistic materialism must stand for ideal mr mcgee mr. levy with a question for vice president nixon mr levy mr. vice president the|labor|department today add more major industrial center to the list of area with substantial unemployment say in new|york this|week that as president would use the full power of the government if necessary to combat unemployment specifically what measure would advocate and at what point mr nixon to combat unemployment first must concentrate on the very area to which refer the so call depressed area now in the last congress the special session of the congress there be a bill by the president by senator kennedy and member of party now the bill that the president have submit would have provide more aid for those area that really need area like scranton and wilkes barre and the area of west|virginia than the one that senator kennedy be support on the other hand find that the bill get into the legislative difficulty and consequently no action be take so point at the high priority must get a bill for depressed area through the next congress have make recommendation on that and have discuss previously and will spell out further in the campaign second as consider this problem of unemployment have to realize where be in analyze the figure will find that unemployment exist among the old citizen exist also among those who be inadequately train that is those who do not have an adequate opportunity for education also exist among minority group if be go to combat unemployment then have to do a well job in these area that be why have a program for education a program in the case of equal job opportunity and one that would also deal with old citizen now finally with regard to the whole problem of combat recession as call must use the full resource of the government in these respect must see to that credit be expand as go into any recessionary period and understand do not believe be go into a recession believe this economy be sound and that be go to move up but in addition to that if do get into a recessionary period should move on that part of the economy which be represent by the private sector and mean stimulate that part of the economy that can create job the private sector of the economy this mean through tax reform and if necessary tax cut that will stimulate more job favor that rather than massive federal spending program which will come into effect usually long after have pass through the recessionary period so must use all of these weapon for the purpose of combat recession if should come but do not expect to come mr mcgee senator kennedy mr kennedy well mr. nixon have state the record inaccurately in regard to the depressed area bill be very familiar with come out of the committee of which be the chairman the labor subcommittee in be the floor manager pass an area redevelopment bill far more effective than the bill the administration suggest on occasion and the president veto both time pass a bill again this|year in the cong- in the senate and die in the|rules|committee of the|house|of|representatives let make very clear that the bill that mr. nixon talk about do not mention wilkes barre or scranton do not mention west|virginia bill be far more effective the bill introduce and erd- sponsor by senator douglas be far more effective in try to stimulate the economy of those area secondly have mention the problem of old citizen can not still understand why this administration and mr. nixon oppose put medical care for the aged under social|security to give some security third believe should step up the use of surplus food in these area until be able to get the people back to work five|cent a day that be what the food package average per person fourthly believe should not carry out a hard money high interest rate policy which help intensify certainly the recession of and think help bring the slow down of if move into a recession in then would agree that have to put more money into the economy and can be do by either of the method discuss be by ex- the program such as aid to education the other would be to make a judgment on what be the most effective tax program to stimulate economy mr mcgee mr. niven with a question for senator kennedy mr niven senator while the main theme of campaign have be this decline of american power and prestige in the|last|eight|years have hardly criticize president eisenhower at all and in a speech last|weekend say have no quarrel with the president now be not mr. eisenhower and not mr. nixon responsible for any such decline mr kennedy well understand that this be the|eisenhower nixon|administration accord to all the republican uh propaganda that have read the question be what be go to do in the future have be critical of this administration and have be critical of the president in fact uh mr. nixon uh discuss that a|week|ago in a speech believe that power and prestige in the|last|eight|years have decline now what be the issue be what be go to do in the future now that be an issue between mr. nixon and feel that be move ahead uh in a be not go into a recession in this country economically feel that power and prestige be strong than ever be relative to that of the communists that be move ahead disagree and believe the american people have to make the choice on november|eighth between the view of whether have to move ahead faster whether what be do now be not satisfactory whether have to build great strength at home and abroad and mr. nixon 's view that be the great issue president eisenhower move from the scene on january|twentieth and be the critical year and that be the debate that be the argument between mr. nixon and and on that issue the american people have to make judgment and think be a important judgment think in many way this election be more important than any since or certainly almost any in this|century because disagree very fundamentally on the position of the|united|state and if view prevail then think that be go to bring an important result to this country in the sixty if view prevail that have to do more that have to make a great national and international effort that have lose prestige in latin|america the president of brazil the new incumbent run for office call on castro during campaign because think be important to get the vote of those who be support castro in in africa the|united|state have ignore latin|uh|-|africa give more scholarship to the congo this summer offer than have give to all of africa the|year|before less|than|two|hundred for all the country of africa and need train leadership more than anything have be uh have a very clear decision in mr. nixon have be part of that administration be have experience in and believe this administration have not meet responsibility in the|last|eight|years that power relative to that of the communists be decline that be face a very hazardous time in the sixty and unless the|united|state begin to move here unless start to go ahead do not believe that be go to meet responsibility to own people or to the cause of freedom think the choice be clear and involve the future mr mcgee mr. vice president mr nixon well first of all think senator kennedy should make up mind with regard to responsibility in first debate indicate that have not have experience or at least uh have not participate significantly in the making of the decision be glad to hear tonight that do suggest that have have some experience let make position cl ear have participate in the discussion lead to the decision in this administration be proud of the record of this administration do not stand on because be not something to stand on but something to build on now look at senator kennedy 's credential be suggest that will move america faster and further than will but what do offer offer retread of program that fail submit to that as look at program program for example with regard to the|federal|reserve and uh free money or loose money uh high low interest rate program in the economic field generally be the program that be adopt and try during the|truman|administration and when compare the economic progress of this country in the|truman|administration with that of the|eisenhower|administration find that in every index there have be a tr- great deal more performance and more progress in this administration than in that say the program and the leadership that fail then be not the program and the leadership that america need now say that the american people do not want to go back to those policy and incidentally if senator kennedy disagree should indicate where believe those policy be different from those be advocate today mr mcgee mr. spivak with a question for vice president nixon mr spivak mr. vice president accord to news dispatch soviet premier khrushchev say today that prime minister macmillan have assure that there would be a summit conference next|year after the presidential election have give any cause for such assurance and do consider desirable or even possible that there would be a summit conference next|year if mr. khrushchev persist in the condition be lay down mr nixon no of course have not talk to prime minister macmillan would not be appropriate for to do so the president be still go to be president for the|next|four|month and of course be the only who could commit this country in this period as far as a summit conference be concern want to make position absolutely clear would be willing as president to meet with mr. khrushchev or any other world leader if would serve the cause of peace would not be able wou- would be willing to meet with however unless there be preparation for that conference which would give some reasonable certainty some reasonable certainty that be go to have some success must not build up the hope of the world and then dash as be the case in paris there mr. khrushchev come to that conference determine to break up be go to break up because would know that be not go to get way on berlin and on the other key matter with which be concern at the|paris|conference now if be go to have another summit conference there must be negotiation at the diplomatic level the ambassador the|secretaries|of|state and other at that level prior to that time which will delineate the issue and which will prepare the way for the head of state to meet and make some progress otherwise if find the head of state meeting and not make progress will find that the cause of peace will have be hurt rather than help so under these circumstance therefore strongly urge and will strongly hold if have the opportunity to urge or to hold this position that any summit conference would be go into only after the most careful preparation and only after mr. khrushchev after disgraceful conduct at paris after disgraceful conduct at the|united|nation give some assurance that really want to sit down and talk and to accomplish something and not just to make propaganda mr mcgee senator kennedy mr kennedy have no disagreement with the vice president 's position on that view be the same as let say there be only|one uh point would add that before go into the summit before ever meet again think be important that the|united|state build strength that build military strength as well as own economic strength if negotiate from a position where the power balance or wave be move away from be extremely difficult to reach a successful decision on berlin as well as the other question now the next president of the|united|state in his|first|year be go to be confront with a very serious question on defense of berlin commitment to berlin be go to be a test of nerve and will be go to be a test of strength and because be go to move in and partly because have not maintain strength with sufficient vigor in the|last|years believe that before meet that crisis that the next president of the|united|states should send a message to congress ask for a revitalization of military strength because come spring or late in the winter be go to be face to face with the most serious berlin crisis since l949 or on the question of the summit agree with the position of mr. nixon would not meet mr. khrushchev unless there be some agreement at the secondary level foreign minister or ambassador which would indicate that the meeting would have some hope of success or a useful exchange of idea mr mcgee mr. levy with a question for senator kennedy mr levy senator in acceptance speech at los|angeles say that campaign would be base not on what intend to offer the american people but what intend to ask of since that time have spell out many of the thing that intend to do but have make only vague reference to sacrifice and self denial believe say that would not hesitate to recommend a tax increase if consider necessary mr kennedy that be right mr levy be this what have in mind mr kennedy well do not think that in the winter of under present economic condition uh a uh tax uh increase would be desirable in fact would be deflationary would cause great unemployment would cause a real slowdown in economy if ever become necessary and be wise economically and essential to security would have no hesitancy in suggest a tax increase or any other policy which would defend the|united|state have talk in every speech about the fact that these be go to be very difficult time in the sixty and that be go to have to meet responsibility as citizen be talk about a national mood be talk about willingness to bear any burden in order to maintain own freedom and in order to meet freedom around the globe do not know what the future be go to bring but would not want anyone to elect uh president of the|united|state or vote for under the expectation that life would be easy if be elect now many of the program that be talk about economic growth care for the aged development of natural resource build the strength of the|united|state that be how the|united|state begin to prepare for great action in world|war|ii and in the post - war period if be move ahead if be provide a viable economy if people have sufficient resource so that can consume what produce then this country be on the move then be strong then set a well example to the world so have the problem of not only build own uh military strength and extend uh policy abroad have to do a job here at home so believe that the policy that recommend come under the general heading of strengthen the|united|state be use steel capacity per cent today be not able to consume what be able to produce at a time when the|soviet|union be make great economic gain and all say be do not know what the sixty will bring except think will bring hard time in the uh international sphere hope can move ahead here at home in the|united|state be confident can do a far well job of mobilize economy and resource in the|united|state and merely say that if elect president will do good to carry the|united|state through a difficult period but would not want people to elect because promise the easy soft life think be go to be difficult but be confident that this country can meet responsibility mr mcgee mr. vice president mr nixon well think should be no under no illusion whatever about what the responsibility of the american people will be in the|sixty expenditure for defense expenditure for mutual security expenditure for economic assistance and technical assistance be not go to get less in opinion be go to be de- be great think may be necessary that have more taxis hope not hope can economize elsewhere so that do not have to but would have no hesitation to ask the american people to pay the taxis even in l961 if necessary to maintain a sound economy and also to maintain a sound dollar because when do not tax and tax enough to pay for outgo pay many time over in high price and inflation and simply will not do that think should also add that as far as senator kennedy 's proposal be concern if intend to carry out platform the adopt in los|angeles be just impossible for to make good on those promise without raise taxis or without have a rise in price or both the platform suggest that can be do through economic growth that can be do in effect with mirror but be not go to be work that way can not add billions|of|dollar to expenditure and not pay for after all be not pay for by money be not pay for by but by the people 's money mr mcgee mr. niven with a question for vice president nixon mr niven mr. vice president say that while mr. khrushchev be here senator kennedy should talk about what be right with this country as well as what be wrong with the country in the campaign when be republican candidate for vice president and be eh at war with the communists do feel a similar responsibility to talk about what be right with the country mr nixon do and as point out in make very clear that as far as the|korean|war be concern that feel that the decision to go into the war in korea be right and necessary what criticize be the policy that make necessary to go to korea now incidentally should point out here that senator kennedy have attack foreign policy be say that be be a policy that have lead to defeat and retreat and would like to know where have be defeat and where have retreat in the|truman|administration people go behind the iron curtain include the satellite country of and communist china in this administration have stop at quemoy and matsu have stop in indochina have stop in lebanon have stop in other part of the world would also like to point out that as far as senator kennedy 's comment be concern think have a perfect right and a responsibility to criticize this administration whenever think be wrong but have a responsibility to be accurate and not to misstate the case do not think should say that prestige be at an all time low think this be very harmful at a time mr. khrushchev be here harmful because be wrong do not think be helpful when suggest and be glad be correct this to an extent that seventeen|million people go to bed hungry every|night in the|united|state now this just be not true now there be people who go to bed hungry in the|united|state far less incidentally than use to go to bed hungry when come into power at the end of the|truman|administration but the thing that be right about the|united|state should be emphasize be that less people go to bed hungry in the|united|state than in any major country in the world be the good fed be the good clothe with a well distribution of this world 's good to all of people than any people in history now in point out the thing that be wrong think ought to emphasize america 's strength be not necessary to to run america down in order to build up now so that get absolutely clear senator kennedy must as a candidate as as a candidate in criticize when be wrong and be do a very effective job of that in way but on the other hand have a responsibility to be accurate and have a responsibility to correct every time misstate the case and intend to continue to do so mr mcgee senator kennedy mr kennedy well mr. nixon will just give the testimony of mr. george|aiken|-|senator george|aiken the rank minority member republican member and former chairman of the|senate|agricultural|committee testify in say there be six|million americans who do not have the income to afford a decent diet mr. benson testify on the food stamp plan in say there be five|million americans who could not afford a elementary low cost diet and define that as someone who use bean in place of meat now have see a good many hundreds|of|thousand of people who be uh not adequately feed can not tell that a surplus food distribution of five|cent per person and that nearly americans receive that be adequate can not tell that any one who use bean instead of meat in and there be five|million of accord to mr. benson be well fed or adequately feed believe that should not compare what figure may be to india or some other country that have serious problem but to remember that be the most prosperous country in the world and that these people be not get adequate food and be not get in many case adequate shelter and ought to try to meet the problem secondly mr. nixon have continue to state and state last|week these fantastic figure of what the democratic budget would c- uh platform would cost be wholly inaccurate say last|week believe in a balanced budget unless there be a severe recession and after all the bad unbalanced budget in history be in twelve|billion|dollar large than in any administration in the history of the|united|state so that believe that on this subject can balance the budget unless have a national emergency or unless have a severe recession mr mcgee mr. morgan with a question for senator kennedy mr morgan senator saturday on television say that have always think that quemoy and matsu be unwise place to draw defense line in the|far|east would comment further on that and also address to this question could not a pullback from those island be interpret as appeasement mr kennedy well uh have on occasion attempt uh mostly in the middle fifty to persuade chiang|kai shek to pull troop back to formosa believe strongly in the defense of formosa these island be a|few|miles|-|five|or|six|mile off the coast of red|china within a general harbor area and from formosa have never say flatly that will defend quemoy and matsu if be attack say will defend if be part of a general attack on formosa but be extremely difficult to make that judgment now mr. herter in when be under secretary of state say be strategically undefensible admirals spruance and callins in say that should not attempt to defend these island in conference in the|far|east general ridgway have say the same thing believe that when get into a if be go to get into war for the defense of formosa ought to be on a clearly define line of the problem think at the time of south|korea be the question of whether the|united|state would defend if be attack believe that should defend formosa should come to defense to leave this rather in the air that will defend under some condition but not under other think be a mistake secondly would not suggest the withdrawal at the point of the communist gun be a decision finally that the nationalists should make and believe that should consult with and attempt to work out a plan by which the line be draw at the island of formosa leave a|hundred|miles between the sea but with general ridgway mr. herter general|collins admiral spruance and many other think be unwise to take the chance of be drag into a war which may lead to a world war over island which be not strategically defensible which be not accord to testimony essential to the defense of formosa think that uh should protect commitment believe strongly should do so in berlin believe strongly should do so in formosa and believe should meet commitment to every country whose security have guarantee but do not believe that that line in case of war should be draw on those island but instead on the island of formosa and as long as be not essential to the defense of formosa be be judgment ever since at the time of the|eisenhower|doctrine for the|far|east that line should be draw in the sea around the island mr mcgee mr. vice president mr nixon disagree completely with senator kennedy on this point remember in the period immediately before the|korean|war south|korea be suppose to be indefensible as well general testify to that and secretary acheson make a very famous speech at the|press|club early in the|year that korean|war start indicate in effect that south|korea be beyond the defense zone of the|united|state suppose be hope when make that speech that would not get into a war but do not mean that have to go in when come in now think as far as quemoy and matsu be concern that the question be not these little piece of real estate be unimportant be not the few people who live on be not too important be the principle involved these island be in the area of freedom the nationalists have these island should not uh force nationalist ally to get off of and give to the communists if do that start a chain reaction because the communists be not after quemoy and matsu be be after formosa in opinion this be the same kind of woolly think that lead to disaster for america in korea be against would never tolerate as president of the|united|state and will hope that senator kennedy will change mind if should be elect mr mcgee gentleman have approximately|four|minute remain may ask to make question and answer as brief as possible consistent with clarity and mr. levy have a question for vice president nixon mr levy mr. vice president be urge voter to forget party label and vote for the man senator kennedy say that in do this be try to run away from party on such issue as housing and aid to education by advocate what call a too program why do say that party label be not important mr nixon because that be the way elect a president in this country and be the way should be a student of history as be senator kennedy incidentally and have find that in the history of this country have have many great president some of have be democrats and some of have be republicans the people some way have always understand that at a particular time a certain man be the one the country need now believe that in an election when be try to determine who should lead the free world not just america perhaps as senator kennedy have already indicate the most important election in history be not the label that wear or that wear that count be what be be whole life be what stand for be what believe and consequently do not think be enough to go before republican audience and never do and say look vote for because be a republican do not think be enough for senator kennedy to go before the audience on the democratic side and say vote for because be a democrat that be not enough what be involve here be the question of leadership for the whole free world now that mean the good leadership may be republican may be democratic but the people be the one that determine the people have to make up mind and believe the people therefore should be ask to make up mind not simply on the basis of vote the way grandfather do vote the way mother do think the people should put america first rather than party first now as far as run away from party be concern senator kennedy have say that have no compassion for the poor that be against progress the enemy of progress be the term that be use and the like all that can say be this do have program in all of these field education housing defense that will move america forward will move forward faster and will move more surely than in program this be what deeply believe be sure believe just as deeply that will move that way suggest however that in the interest of fairness that could give the benefit of also believe as believe mr mcgee senator kennedy mr kennedy well let say do think that party be important in that tell something about the program and something about the man abraham|lincoln be a great president of all the people but be select by party at a key time in history because party stand for something the democratic party in this|century have stand for something have stand for progress have stand for concern for the people 's welfare have stand for a strong foreign policy and a strong national defense and as a result produce wilson president roosevelt and president truman the republican party have produce mckinley and harding coolidge dewey and landon do stand for something stand for a whole different approach to the problem face this country at home and abroad that be the importance of party only if tell something about the record and the republicans in recent|years not only in the last five|years but in the|last|eight|years have oppose housing oppose care for the aged oppose federal aid to education oppose minimum wage and think that record tell something mr mcgee thank gentleman neither the question from the reporter nor the answer hear from senator john|kennedy or vice president richard|nixon be rehearse by agreement neither candidate make an open statement or a closing summation further agree that the clock alone would decide who would speak last and each have ask to express thank to the network and affiliated station another program similar to this one will be present thursday,|october|thirteenth and the final program will be present friday,|october|twenty first hope this series of radio and television program will help toward a fuller understanding of the issue face country today and that on election|day november|eighth will vote for the candidate of choice this be frank|mcgee good night from washington & nbsp & nbsp view transcript transcript howard k.|smith moderator good evening the television and radio station of the|united|state and affiliated station be proud to provide facility for a discussion of issue in the current political campaign by the major candidate for the presidency the candidate need no introduction the republican candidate vice president richard|m.|nixon and the democratic candidate senator john|f.|kennedy accord to rule set by the candidate each man shall make an open statement of approximately|eight|minutes ' duration and a close statement of approximately|three|minutes ' duration in between the candidate will answer or comment upon answer to question put by a panel of correspondent in this the first discussion in a series of uh joint appearance the subject matter have be agree will be restrict to internal or domestic american matter and now for the first opening statement by senator john|f.|kennedy senator kennedy mr. smith mr. nixon in the election of say the question be whether this nation could exist half slave or half free in the election of and with the world around the question be whether the world will exist half slave or half free whether will move in the direction of freedom in the direction of the road that be take or whether will move in the direction of slavery think will depend in great measure upon what do here in the|united|state on the kind of society that build on the kind of strength that maintain discuss tonight domestic issue but would not want that to be any implication to be give that this do not involve directly struggle with mr. khrushchev for survival mr. khrushchev be in new|york and maintain the communist offensive throughout the world because of the productive power of the|soviet|union the chinese communists have always have a large population but be important and dangerous now because be mount a major effort within own country the kind of country have here the kind of society have the kind of strength build in the|united|state will be the defense of freedom if do well here if meet obligation if be move ahead then think freedom will be secure around the world if fail then freedom fail therefore think the question before the american people be be do as much as can do be as strong as should be be as strong as must be if be go to maintain independence and if be go to maintain and hold out the hand of friendship to those who look to for assistance to those who look to for survival should make very clear that do not think be do enough that be not satisfied as an american with the progress that be make this be a great country but think could be a great country and this be a powerful country but think could be a more powerful country be not satisfied to have fifty|percent of steel mill capacity unused be not satisfied when the|united|state have last|year the low rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world because economic growth mean strength and vitality mean be able to sustain defense mean be able to meet commitment abroad be not satisfied when have over nine|billion|dollar worth of food some of rot even though there be a hungry world and even though four|million americans wait every month for a food package from the government which average five|cent a day per individual see case in west|virginia here in the|united|state where child take home part of school lunch in order to feed family because do not think be meet obligation toward these americans be not satisfied when the|soviet|union be turn out twice as many scientist and engineer as be be not satisfied when many of teacher be inadequately pay or when child go to school part time shift think should have an educational system second to none be not satisfied when see man like jimmy|hoffa in charge of the large union in the|united|state still free be not satisfied when be fail to develop the natural resource of the|united|state to the full here in the|united|state which develop the|tennessee|valley and which build the grand coulee and the other dam in the|northwest|united|state at the present rate of hydropow production and that be the hallmark of an industrialized society the|soviet|union by will be produce more power than be these be all the thing think in this country that can make society strong or can mean that stand still be not satisfied until every american enjoy full constitutional right if a negro baby be bear and this be true also of and mexicans in some of city have about|one half as much chance to get through high school as a white baby have third as much chance to get through college as a white student have about|a|third as much chance to be a professional man about|half as much chance to own a house have about|uh|-|four time as much chance that will be out of work in life as the white baby think can do better do not want the talent of any american to go to waste know that there be those who want to turn everything over to the government do not at all want the individual to meet responsibility and want the state to meet responsibility but think there be also a national responsibility the argument have be use against every piece of social legislation in the last five|year the people of the|united|state individually could not have develop the|tennessee|valley collectively could have a cotton farmer in georgia or a peanut farmer or a dairy farmer in wisconsin and minnesota can not protect against the force of supply and demand in the market place but work together in effective governmental program can do so americans who live over on an average social|security check of about|seventy eight|dollars a month be not able to sustain individually but can sustain through the social security system do not believe in big government but believe in effective governmental action and think that be the only way that the|united|stat be go to maintain freedom be the only way that be go to move ahead think can do a well job think be go to have to do a well job if be go to meet the responsibility which time and event have place upon can not turn the job over to anyone else if the|united|state fail then the whole cause of freedom fail and think depend in great measure on what do here in this country the reason franklin|roosevelt be a good neighbor in latin|america be because be a good neighbor in the|united|state because feel that the american society be move again want to recapture that image want people in latin|america and africa and asia to start to look to america to see how be do thing to wonder what the resident of the|united|state be do and not to look at khrushchev or look at the chinese communists that be the obligation upon generation in franklin|roosevelt say in inaugural that this generation of americans have a rendezvous with destiny think generation of americans have the same rendezvous the question now be can freedom be maintain under the most severe tack attack have ever know think can be and think in the final analysis depend upon what do here think be time america start move again mr smith and now the open statement by vice president richard|m.|nixon mr nixon mr. smith senator kennedy the thing that senator kennedy have say many of can agree with there be no question but that can not discuss internal affair in the|united|state without recognize that have a tremendous bearing on international position there be no question but that this nation can not stand still because be in a deadly competition a competition not only with the man in the kremlin but the man in peking be ahead in this competition as senator kennedy think have imply but when be in a race the only way to stay ahead be to move ahead and subscribe completely to the spirit that senator kennedy have express tonight the spirit that the|united|states should move ahead where then do disagree think disagree on the implication of remark tonight and on the statement that have make on many occasion during campaign to the effect that the|united|states have be stand still hear tonight for example the statement make that growth in national product last|year be the low of any industrial nation in the world now last|year of course be that happen to be but when look at the growth of g.n.p. this|year a year of recovery find that be and tenth per cent and of the high in the world today more about that later look then to this problem of how the|united|state should move ahead and where the|united|state be move think be well that take the advice of a very famous campaigner let look at the record be stand still be true that this administration as senator kennedy have charge have be an administration of retreat of defeat of stagnation be true that as far as this country be concern in the field of electric power in all of the field that have mention have not be move ahead well have a comparison that can make have the record of the|truman|administration of seven|and|a|half|year and the seven|and|a|half|year of the|eisenhower|administration when compare these record in the area that senator kennedy have have discuss tonight think find that america have be move ahead let take school have build more school in these|last|seven|and|a|half|year than build in for that matter in let take hydroelectric power have develop more hydroelectric power in these|seven|and|a|half|years than be develop in any previous administration in history let take hospital find that more have be build in this administration than in the previous administration the same be true of highway let put in term that all of can understand often hear gross national product discuss and in that respect may say that when compare the growth in this administration with that of the previous administration that then there be a total growth of eleven|percent over seven|year in this administration there have be a total growth of nineteen|per|cent over seven|year that show that there be be more growth in this administration than in predecessor but let not put there let put in term of the average family what have happen to find that wage have go up time as much in the|eisenhower|administration as do in the|truman|administration what about the price pay find that the price pay go up time as much in the|truman|administration as do in the|eisenhower|administration what be the net result of this this mean that the average family income go up fifteen|per|cent in the|eisenhower|year as against two|per|cent in the|truman|year now this be not stand still but good as this record be may emphasize be not enough a record be never something to stand on be something to build on and in building on this record believe that have the secret for progress know the way to progress and think first of all own record prove that know the way senator kennedy have suggest that believe know the way respect the sincerity which which make that suggestion but on the other hand when look at the various program that offer do not seem to be new seem to be simply retread of the program of the|truman|administration which precede and would suggest that during the course of the evening may indicate those area in which program be new where will mean more progress than have then what kind of program be for be for program that will expand educational opportunity that will give to all americans equal chance for education for all of the thing which be necessary and dear to the heart of people be for program in addition which will see that medical care for the aged be be be much be much better handle than be at the present time here again may indicate that senator kennedy and be not in disagreement as to the aim both want to help the old people want to see that do have adequate medical care the question be the mean think that the mean that advocate will reach that goal better than the mean that advocate could give well example but for for whatever be whether be in the field of housing or health or medical care or school or the eh- development of electric power have program which believe will move america move forward and build on the wonderful record that have make over these|past|seven|and|a|half|year now when look at these program may suggest that in evaluate often have a tendency to say that the test of a program be how much be spend will concede that in all the area to which have refer senator kennedy would have the spe- federal government spend more than would have spend cost out the cost of the democratic platform run a minimum of thirteen|and|two tenth billion dollar a year more than be presently spend to a maximum of eighteen|billion|dollar a year more than be presently spend now the republican platform will cost more too will cost a minimum of four|billion|dollars a year more a maximum of four|and|nine tenth dollar a year more than be presently spend now do this mean that program be well than ours not at all because be not a question of how much the federal government spend be not a question of which government do the most be a question of which administration do the right thing and in case do believe that program will stimulate the creative energy of a|hundred|and|eighty|million free americans believe the program that senator kennedy advocate will have a tendency to stifle those creative energy believe in other word that program would lead to the stagnation of the motive power that need in this country to get progress the final point that would like to make be this senator kennedy have suggest in speech that lack compassion for the poor for the old and for other that be unfortunate let understand throughout this campaign that motif and mine be sincere know what mean to be poor know what mean to see people who be unemployed know senator kennedy feel as deeply about these problem as do but disagreement be not about the goal for america but only about the means to reach those goal mr smith thank mr. nixon that complete the opening statement and now the candidate will answer question or comment upon another 's answer to question put by correspondent of the network the correspondent introduce be nbc|news be charles|warren mutual|new be stuart|novin bob|fleming the first question to senator kennedy from mr. fleming mr fleming senator the vice president in campaign have say that be naive and at time immature have raise the question of leadership on this issue why do think people should vote for rather than the vice president mr kennedy well the vice president and come to the congress together both serve in have be there now for fourteen|years the same period of time that have so that experience in uh government be comparable secondly think the question be uh what be the program that advocate what be the party record that lead come out of the democratic party which in this|century have produce woodrow|wilson and franklin|roosevelt and harry|truman and which support and sustain these program which have discuss tonight mr. nixon come out of the republican party be nominate by and be a fact that through most of these last five|year the republican leadership have oppose federal aid for education medical care for the aged development of the|tennessee|valley development of natural resource think mr. nixon be an effective leader of party hope would grant the same the question before be which point of view and which party do want to lead the|united|state mr smith mr. nixon would like to comment on that statement mr. nixon have no comment mr. smith the next question mr. novins mr novins mr. vice president campaign stress the value of eight|year experience and the question arise as to whether that experience be as an observer or as a participant or as an initiator of policy making would tell please specifically what major proposal have make in the|last|eight|years that have be adopt by the administration mr nixon would be rather difficult to cover in and- in would suggest that these proposal could be mention first after each of foreign trip have make recommendation that have be adopt for example after first trip abroad abroad strongly recommend that increase exchange program particularly as relate to exchange of person of leader in the labor field and in the information field after trip to south|america make recommendation that a separate inter - american lending agency be set up which the south|american nation would like much well than a lend- than to participate in the lending agency which treat all the country of the world the same uh have make other recommendation after each of the other trip for example after trip abroad to hungary make some recommendation with regard to the hungarian refugee situation which be adopt not only by the president but some of be enact into law by the congress within the administration as a chairman of the|president's|committee|on|price|stability|and|economic|growth have have the opportunity to make recommendation which have be adopt within the administration and which think have be reasonably effective know senator kennedy suggest in speech at cleveland yesterday that that committee have not be particularly effective would only suggest that while do not take the credit for would not presume to that since that committee have be form the price line have be hold very well within the|united|state mr kennedy well would say in the latter that the and that be what find uh somewhat unsatisfactory about the figure uh mr. nixon that use in previous speech when talk about the|truman|administration mr. truman come to office in and at the end of the war and uh difficulty that be face the|united|state during that period of transition when price control be lift so be rather difficult to use an overall figure take those seven|and|a|half|year and compare to prefer to take the overall percentage record of of the democrats and the|eight|years of the republicans to show an overall period of growth in regard to uh price stability uh be not aware that that committee do produce recommendation that ever be certainly before the congress from the point of view of legislation in regard to control price in regard to the exchange of student and labor union be chairman of the subcommittee on africa and think that of the most unfortunate phase of policy towards that country be the very minute number of exchange that have think be true of also do come forward with a program of student for the congo of over which be more than the federal government have for all of africa the|previous|year so that do not think that uh have move at least in those area with sufficient vigor mr smith the next question to senator kennedy from mr. warren mr warren uh senator kennedy during brief speech a|few|minutes|ago mention farm surplus mr kennedy that be correct mr warren would like to ask this be a fact think that presidential candidate traditionally make promise to farmer lot of people think do not understand why the government pay farmer for not produce certain crop or pay farmer if overproduce for that matter now let ask sir why can not the farmer operate like the business man who operate a factory if an auto company overproduce a certain model car uncle|sam do not step in and buy up the surplus why this constant courting of the farmer mr kennedy well because think that if the federal government move out of the program and withdraw support uh then think would have complete uh economic chaos the farmer plant in the|spring and harvest in the fall there be hundreds|of|thousand of really do not be not able to control market very well bring crop in or livestock in many of about the same time have only a few purchaser that buy milk or hog a few large company in many case and therefore the farmer be not in a position to bargain very effectively in the market place think the experience of the twenty have show what a free market could do to agriculture and if the agricultural economy collapse then the economy of the rest of the|united|state sooner or later will collapse the farmer be the number market for the automobile industry of the|united|state the automobile industry be the number market for steel so if the farmer ' economy continue to decline as sharply as have in recent|years then think would have a recession in the rest of the country so think the case for the government intervention be a good one secondly objection to present farm policy be that there be no effective control to bring supply and demand into well balance the dropping of the support price in order to limit production do not work and now have the high uh surplus nine|billion|dollar worth have have a uh high tax load from the treasury for the farmer in the|last|few|year with the low farm income in many|years think that this farm policy have fail in judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance and that can only be do through governmental action therefore suggest that in those basic commodity which be support that the federal government after endorsement by the farmer in that commodity attempt to bring supply and demand into balance attempt effective production control so that will not have that or per cent surplus which break the price fifteen|or think mr. benson 's program have fail and must say after read the vice president 's speech before the farmer as read mine do not believe that be very much different from mr. benson 's do not think provide effective governmental control think the support price be tie to the average market price of which be mr. benson 's theory therefore do not believe that this be a sharp enough breach with the past to give any hope of success for the future mr smith mr. nixon comment mr nixon of course disagree with senator kennedy insofar as suggestion as to what should be do uh with re- on the farm program have make the suggestion that what need be to move in the direction of more government control a suggestion that would also mean raise price uh that the consumer pay for product and im- and impose upon the farmer uh control on acreage even far more than have today think this be the wrong direction do not think this have work in the past do not think will work in the future the program that have advocate be which depart from the present program that have in this respect recognize that the government have a responsibility to get the farmer out of the trouble presently be in because the government get into and that be the fundamental reason why can not let the farmer go by at the present time the farmer produce these surplus because the government ask to through legislation during the war now that have these surplus be responsibility to indemnify the farmer during that period that get rid of the farmer uh the surplus until get the surplus off the farmer 's back however should have a program such as announce which will see that farm income hold up but would propose hold that income up not through a type of program that senator kennedy have suggest that would raise price but one that would indemnify the farmer pay the farmer in kind uh from the product which be in surplus mr. smith the next question to vice president nixon from mr. vanocur mr vanocur uh mr. vice president since the question of executive leadership be a very important campaign issue would like to follow mr. novins ' question now republican campaign slogan will see on sign around the country as do last|week say be experience that count that be over a picture of sir uh imply that have have more governmental executive decision make uh experience than uh opponent now in news conference on august|twenty fourth president eisenhower be ask to give example of a major idea of that adopt reply be and be quote if give may think of do not remember now that be a|month|ago sir and the president have not bring up since and be wonder sir if can clarify which version be correct the put out by republican campaign leader or the put out by president eisenhower mr nixon well would suggest mr. vanocur that uh if know the president that be probably a facetious remark uh would also suggest that insofar as statement be concern that think would be improper for the president of the|united|state to disclose uh the instance in which member of official family have make recommendation as have make through the|year to which have accept or reject the president have always maintain and very properly so that be entitle to get what advice want from cabinet and from other adviser without disclose that to anybody include as a matter of fact the congress now can only say this through the year have sit in the|national|security|council have be in the cabinet have meet with the legislative leader have meet with the president when make the great decision with regard to lebanon quemoy and matsu other matter the president have ask for advice have give sometimes advice have be take sometimes have not do not say that have make the decision and would say that no president should ever allow anybody else to make the major decision the president only make the decision all that adviser do be to give counsel when ask for as far as what experience count and whether that be experience that count that be not for to say uh can only say that experience be there for the people to consider senator kennedy 's be there for the people to consider as point out come to the congress in the|same|year experience have be different from have be in the executive branch have be in the legislative branch would say that the people now have the opportunity to evaluate as against mine and think both and be go to abide by whatever the people decide mr smith senator kennedy mr. kennedy well will just say that the question be of experience and the question also be uh what judgment be of the future and what goal be for the|united|state and what ability have to implement those goal abraham|lincoln come to the presidency in after a rather little known uh session in the|house|of|representatives and after be defeat for the senate in and be a distinguished president there be no certain road to the presidency there be no guarantee that uh if take uh road or another that will be a successful president have be in the congress for fourteen|years have vote in the last uh year uh and the vice president be uh presiding over the senate and meet other responsibility have meet meet uh decision over|eight|hundr time on matter which affect not only the domestic security of the|united|state but as a member of the|senate|foreign|relations|committee the question really be which candidate and which party can meet the problem that the|united|stat be go to face in the sixty mr smith the next question to senator kennedy from mr. novins mr novins senator kennedy in connection with these problem of the future that speak of and the program that enunciate earlier in direct talk call for expand some of the welfare program for school for teacher salary medical care and so forth but also call for reduce the federal debt and be wonder how if be president in january would go about pay the bill for all this do this mean that mr kennedy do not indicate do not advocate reduce the federal debt because do not believe that be go to be able to reduce the federal debt very much in nineteen|sixty or think have heavy obligation which affect security which be go to have to meet and therefore have never suggest should uh be able to retire the debt substantially or even at all in nineteen|sixty mr novins senator believe in in of speech mr kennedy no never mr novins suggest that reduce the interest rate would help toward mr kennedy no no not reduce the interest mr novins a reduction of the federal debt mr kennedy reduce the interest rate in judgment the hard money tight money policy fiscal policy of this administration have contribute to the slow down in economy which help bring the recession of which make the recession of rather intense and which have slow somewhat economic activity in what have talk about however the kind of program that have talk about in judgment be uh fiscally sound medical care for the aged would put under social security the vice president and disagree on this the program the javits nixon or the nixon javits program would have cost if fully use uh dollar by the government per year and six|hundred|million|dollar by the state the program which advocate which fail by vote in the|united|states|senate would have put medical care for the aged in social|security and would have be pay for through the|social|security|system and the social|security tax secondly support federal aid to education and federal aid for teacher ' salary think that be a good investment think be go to have to do and think to heap the burden further on the property tax which be already strain in many of community will provide will make sh- insure in opinion that many of child will not be adequately educate and many of teacher not adequately compensate there be no great return to an economy or to a society than an educational system second to none on the question of the development of natural resource would pay as go in the sense that would be balance and the power revenue would bring back sufficient money to finance the project in the same way as the|tennessee|valley believe in the balanced budget and the only condition under which would unbalance the budget would be if there be a grave national emergency or a serious recession otherwise with a steady rate of economic growth and mr. nixon and mr. rockefeller in meeting say a five|per|cent economic growth would bring by ten|billion|dollars extra in tax revenue whatever be bring in think that can finance essential program within a balanced budget if business remain orderly mr smith mr. nixon comment mr nixon yes think what mr. novins be refer to be not of senator kennedy 's speech but the democratic platform which do mention cut the national debt think too that should be point out that of course be not possible particularly under the proposal that senator kennedy have advocate either to cut the national debt or to reduce taxis as a matter of fact will be necessary to raise taxis as senator kennedy point out that as far as proposal be concern the one for medical care for the age that that would be finance out of social|security that however be raise taxis for those who pay social|security point out that would make pay as go be the basis for natural resource development where natural resource development which also support incidentally however whenever uh uh in in uh appropriate money for of these project have to pay now and appropriate the money and the eh- while eventually do pay out do not mean that the government do not have to put out the money this|year and so would say that in all of these proposal senator kennedy have make will result in of thing either have to raise taxis or have to unbalance the budget if unbalance the budget that mean have inflation and that will be of course a very cruel blow to the very people the old people that have be talk about as far as aid for school construction be concern favor that as senator kennedy do in january|of|this|year when say favor that rather than aid to teacher salary favor that because believe that be the good way to aid school without run any risk whatever of the federal government tell teacher what to teach mr smith the next question to vice president nixon from mr. warren mr warren mr. vice president mention school and be just yesterday think ask for a crash program to raise education standard and this evening talk about advance in education mr. vice president say be back in that salary pay to school teacher be nothing short of a national disgrace high salary for teacher add be important and if the situation be not correct could lead to a national disaster and yet refuse to vote in the senate in order to break a tie vote when that single vote if have be yes would have grant salary increase to teacher wonder if could explain that sir mr nixon be awfully glad get that question because as know get into at the last of other question and be not able to complete the argument uh think that the reason that vote against have the federal government uh pay teacher ' salary be probably the very reason that concern senator kennedy when in january|of|this|year in kick off press conference say that favor aid for school construction but at that time do not feel that there should be aid for teacher ' salary at least that be the way read remark now why should there be any question about the federal government aid teacher ' salary why do senator kennedy take that position then why do take now both take then and take now for this reason want high teacher ' salary need high teacher ' salary but also want education to be free of federal control when the federal government get the power to pay teacher inevitably in opinion will acquire the power to set standard and to tell the teacher what to teach think this would be bad for the country think would be bad for the teaching profession there be another point that should be make favor high salary for teacher but as senator kennedy say in january|of|this|year in this same press conference the way that get high salary for teacher be to support school construction which mean that all of the local school district in the various state then have money which be free to raise the standard for teacher ' salary should also point out this once put the responsibility on the federal government for pay a portion of teacher ' salary local community and state be not go to meet the responsibility as much as should believe in other word that have see the local community and the state assume more of that responsibility teacher ' salary very fortunately have go up fifty|percent in as against only a four|percent rise for other salary this be not enough should be more but do not believe that the way to get more salary for teacher be to have the federal government get in with a massive program objection here be not the cost in dollar objection here be the potential cost in control and eventual freedom for the american people by give the federal government power over education and that be the great power a government can have mr smith senator kennedy 's comment mr kennedy when uh the vice president quote in january do not believe the federal government should pay directly teacher ' salary but that be not the issue before the senate in february the issue before the senate be that the money would be give to the state the state then could determine whether the money would be spend for school construction or teacher salary on that question the vice president and disagree vote in favor of that proposal and support strongly because think that that provide assistance to teacher for salary without any chance of federal control and be on that vote that th- mr. nixon and disagree and tie vote uh defeat break the tie defeat the proposal do not want the federal government pay teacher ' salary directly but if the money will go to the state and the state can then determine whether shall go for school construction or for teacher ' salary in opinion protect the local authority over the school board and the school committee and therefore think that be a sound proposal and that be why support and regret that do not pass secondly there have be statement make that uh the democratic platform would cost a good deal of money and that be in favor of unbalance the budget that be wholly wrong wholly in error and be a fact that in the|last|eight|years the|democratic|congress have reduce the appropri- the request for the appropriation by over|ten|billion|dollars that be not view and think ought to be state very clearly on the record view be that can do these program and should be carefully draw within a balanced budget if economy be move ahead mr smith the next question to senator kennedy from mr. vanocur mr vanocur senator have be promise the voter that if be elect president will try and push through congress bill on medical aid to the age a comprehensive minimum hourly wage bill federal aid to education now in the august post - convention session of the congress when at least hold up the possibility could one|day be president and when have overwhelming majority especially in the senate could not get action on these bill now how do feel that will be able to get in january mr kennedy well as take the bill mr vanocur if be not able to get in august mr kennedy if may take the bill do pass in the senate a bill uh to provide a dollar five|cent minimum wage fail because the house do not pass and the house fail by vote and may say that third of the republicans in the house vote against a dollar five|cent minimum wage and a majority of the democrats sustain nearly|two third of vote for the dollar be threaten by a veto if pass a dollar and a quarter be extremely difficult with the great power that the president do to pass any bill when the president be oppose to all the president need to sustain veto of any bill be third plus in either the house or the senate secondly pass a federal aid to education bill in the senate fail to come to the floor of the|house|of|representatives be kill in the|rules|committee and be a fact in the august session that the member of the|rules|committee who be republicans join with democrats vote against send the aid to education bill to the floor of the house democrats vote for every republican on the|rules|committee vote against send that bill to be consider by the member of the|house|of|representatives thirdly on medical care for the aged this be the same fight that be be go on for five|year in social|security want to tie to social|security offer an amendment to do so democrats vote for republican vote for and be inform at the time come to a vote that if be adopt the president of the|united|state would veto in judgment a vigorous democratic president support by a democratic majority in the house and senate can win the support for these program but if send a republican president and a democratic majority and the threat of a veto hang over the congress in judgment will continue what happen in the august session which be a clash of party and inaction mr smith mr. nixon comment mr nixon well obviously view be a little different first of all do not see how be possible for a|one third of a body such as the republicans have in the house and the senate to stop third if the third be adequately lead would say too that when senator kennedy refer to the action of the|house|rules|committee there be democrats on that committee and republicans would seem to again that be very difficult to blame the republicans for the democrats not get a something through that particular committee would say further that to blame the president in veto power for the inability of the senator and colleague to get action in this special session uh miss the mark when the president exercise veto power have to have the people upo- behind not just|a|third of the congress because let consider if the majority of the member of the congress feel that these particular proposal be good issue the majority of those who be democrats why do not pass and send to the president and get a veto and have an issue the reason why these particular bill in these various field that have be mention be not pass be not because the president be against be because the people be against be because be too extreme and be convince that the alternate proposal that have that the republicans have in the field of health in the field of education in the field of welfare because be not extreme because will accomplish the end uh without too great cost in dollar or in freedom that could get through the next congress mr smith the next question to vice president nixon fa- from mr. fleming mr fleming mr. vice president do take then believe that can work better with democratic majority in the house and senate than senator kennedy could work with democratic majority in the house and senate mr nixon would say this that of course expect to pick up some seat in both in the house and the senate uh would hope to control the house to get a majority in the house uh in this election can not of course control the senate would say that a president will be able to lead a president will be able to get program through to the effect that have the support of the country the support of the people sometimes get the opinion that in get program through the house or the senate be purely a question of legislative finagling and all that sort of thing be not really that whenever a majority of the people be for a program the house and the senate respond to and whether this house and senate in the next session be democratic or republican if the country will have vote for the candidate for the presidency and for the proposal that have make believe that will find that the president if be a republican as would be in case would be able to get program through that congress now also say that as far as senator kennedy 's proposal be concern that again the question be not simply of uh a presidential veto stop program must always remember that a president can not stop anything unless have the people behind and the reason president eisenhower 's veto have be sustain the reason the congress do not send up bill to which think will be veto be because the people and the congress the majority of know the country be behind the president mr smith senator kennedy mr kennedy well now let look at these bill that the vice president suggest be too extreme be a bill for a dollar cent an hour for anyone who work in a store or company that have a|million|dollar a year business do not think that be extreme at all and yet nearly|two third to fourth of the republicans in the|house|of|representatives vote against that proposal secondly be the federal aid to education bill be a very uh because of the defeat of teacher salary be not a bill that uh meet in opinion the need the fact of the matter be be a bill that be less than recommend mr. nixon this|morn in proposal be not an extreme bill and yet could not get republican to join at least think of the democrats vote to send to the floor of the house not republican and join with those democrats who be oppose to do not say the democrats be unite in support of the program but do say a majority be and say a majority of the republicans be oppose to the third be medical care for the aged which be tie to social|security which be finance out of social|security fund do not put a deficit on the treasury the proposal advance by and by mr. javits would have cost six|hundred|millions|of|dollars mr. rockefeller reject in new|york say do not agree with the financing at all say ought to be on social|security so these be program which be quite moderate think show the difference between the party party be ready to move in these program the other party give lip service mr smith mr. warren 's question for senator kennedy mr warren senator kennedy on another subject communism be so often describe as an ideology or a belief that exist somewhere other than in the|united|state let ask sir just how serious a threat to national security be these communist subversive activity in the|united|state today mr kennedy well think be serious think be a matter that should continue to uh give uh great care and attention to should support uh the law which the|united|stat have pass in order to protect from uh those who would destroy from within should sustain uh the|department|of|justice in effort and the f.b.i. and should be continually alert think if the|united|state be maintain a strong society here in the|united|state think that can meet any internal threat the major threat be external and will continue mr smith mr. nixon comment mr nixon agree with senator kennedy 's appraisal generally in this respect the question of communism within the|united|state have be that have worry in the past be one that will continue to be a problem for year to come have to remember that the cold war that mr. khrushchev be wag and colleague be wag be wag all over the world and be wag right here in the|united|state that be why have to continue to be alert be also essential in be alert that be fair fair because by be fair uphold the very freedom that the communists would destroy uphold the standard of conduct which would never follow and in this connection think that uh must look to the future have in mind the fact that fight communism at home not only by law to deal with communists uh the few who do become communists and the few who do become tra- fellow traveler but also fight communism at home by move against those various injustice which exist in society which the communists feed upon and in that connection again would say that while senator kennedy say be for the status quo do believe that uh would agree that be just as sincere in believe that proposal for federal aid to education proposal for health care be just as sincerely hold as the question again be not of goal be for those goal be of mean mr smith mr. vanocur 's question for vice president nixon mr vanocur mr. vice president uh in of early statement say have move ahead have build more school have build more hospital now sir be not true that the building of more school be a local matter for financing uh be claim that the|eisenhower|administration be responsible for the building of these school or be the local school district that provide for mr nixon not at all as a matter of fact question bring out a point that be very glad to make too often in appraise whether be move ahead or not think only of what the federal government be do now that be not the test of whether america move the test of whether america move be whether the federal government plus the state government plus the local government plus the big segment of all individual enterprise move have for example a gross national product of approximately|five|hundred|billion|dollar roughly|a|hundred|billion|to|a|hundred|and|a|quarter|billion of that be the result of government activity four|hundred|billion approximately be a result of what individual do now the reason the|eisenhower|administration have move the reason that have have the fund for example locally to build the school and the hospital and the highway to make the progress that have be because this administration have encourage individual enterprise and have result in the great expansion of the private sector of the economy that have ever be witness in an year period and that be growth that be the growth that be look for be the growth that this administration have support and that policy have stimulate mr smith senator kennedy mr kennedy well must say that the reason that the school have be construct be because the local school district be willing to increase the property taxis to a tremendously high figure in opinion almost to the point of diminish return in order to sustain these school secondly think have a rich uh country and think have a powerful country think what have to do however be have the president and the leadership set before country exactly what must do in the|next|decade if be go to maintain security in education in economic growth in development of natural resource the|soviet|union be make great gain be not enough to compare what may have be do or ten|years|ago or or want to compare what be do with what adversary be do so that by the|year|1970 the|united|state be ahead in education in health in building in home in economic strength think that be the big assignment the big task the big function of the federal government mr smith can have the summation time please have complete question and comment and in just a moment will have the summation time voice this will allow three|minutes|and|twenty|second for the summation by each candidate mr sm1th three|minutes|and|twenty|second for each candidate vice president nixon will make the first summation mr nixon thank mr. smith senator kennedy first of all think be well to put in perspective where really do stand with regard to the|soviet|union in this whole matter of growth the|soviet|union have be move faster than have but the reason for that be obvious start from a much low base although have be move faster in growth than have find for example today that total gross national product be per cent of total gross national product that be the same percentage that be and as far as the absolute gap be concern find that the|united|states be even further ahead than be be this any reason for complacency not at all because these be determined man be fanatical man and have to get the very most of uh out uh out of economy agree with senator kennedy completely on that score where disagree be in the mean that would use to get the most out of economy respectfully submit that senator kennedy too often would rely too much on the federal government on what would do to solve problem to stimulate growth believe that when examine the democratic platform when examine the proposal that have discuss tonight when compare with the proposal that have make that these proposal that make would not result in great growth for this country than would be the case if follow the program that have advocate there be many of the point that have make that would like to comment upon the one in the field of health be worth mention health program the one that senator javits and other republican senators as well as support be one that provide for all people over who want health insurance the opportunity to have if want provide a choice of have either government insurance or private insurance but compel nobody to have insurance who do not want program under social|security would require everybody who have social|security to take government health insurance whether want or not and would not cover several|million people who be not cover by social|security at all here be place where think that program do a well job than the other point that would make be this this downgrading of how much thing cost think many of people will understand well when look at what happen when during the|truman|administration when the government be spend more than take in find saving over a lifetime eat up by inflation find the people who could least afford people on retire income uh people on fix income find unable to meet bill at the|end|of|the|month be essential that a man who be president of this country certainly stand for every program that will mean for growth and stand for program that will mean growth and progress but be also essential that not allow a dollar spend that could be better spend by the people mr smith senator kennedy conclusion mr kennedy the point be make by mr. nixon that the soviet production be only four|percent of must say that four|percent and that soviet country be cause a good deal of trouble tonight want to make sure that stay in that relationship do not want to see the|day when be sixty|percent of and and and and ninety|percent of with all the force and power that could bring to bear in order to cause destruction secondly the vice president mention medical care for the aged program be an amendment to the kerr bill the kerr bill provide assistance to all those who be not on social|security think be a very clear contrast in when the|social|security|act be write out of republicans vote against mr. landon run in to repeal in august|of|1960 when try to get again but this time for medical care receive the support of republican in the senate on this occasion thirdly think the question before the american people be as look at this country and as look at the world around the goal be the same for all americans the mean be at question the mean be at issue if feel that everything that be be do now be satisfactory that the relative power and prestige and strength of the|united|state be increase in relation to that of the communists that have gain more security that be achieve everything as a nation that should achieve that be achieve a well life for citizen and great strength then agree think should vote for mr. nixon but if feel that have to move again in the|sixty that the function of the president be to set before the people the unfinished business of society as franklin|roosevelt do in the thirty the agenda for people what must do as a society to meet need in this country and protect security and help the cause of freedom as say at the beginning the question before all that face all republicans and all democrats be can freedom in the next generation conquer or be the communists go to be successful that be the great issue and if meet responsibility think freedom will conquer if fail if fail to move ahead if fail to develop sufficient military and economic and social strength here in this country then think that uh the tide could begin to run against and do not want historian ten|years|from|now to say these be the|year when the tide run out for the|united|state want to say these be the|year when the tide come in these be the|year when the|united|state start to move again that be the question before the american people and only can decide what want what want this country to be what want to do with the future think be ready to move and be to that great task if be successful that will address mr smith thank very much gentleman this|hour have go by all too quickly thank very much for permit to present the next president of the|united|state on this unique program have be ask by the candidate to thank the american network and the affiliated station for provide time and facility for this joint appearance other debate in this series will be announce later and will be on different subject this be howard|k.|smith good night from chicago & nbsp & nbsp view transcript transcript reverend meza reverend reck be grateful for generous invitation to speak view while the so call religious issue be necessarily and properly the chief topic here tonight want to emphasize from the outset that have far more critical issue to face in the election the spread of communist influence until now fester off the coast of florida the humiliating treatment of president and vice president by those who no longer respect power the hungry child see in west|virginia the old people who can not pay doctor bill the family force to give up farm an america with too many slum with too few school and too late to the moon and outer space these be the real issue which should decide this campaign and be not religious issue for war and hunger and ignorance and despair know no religious barrier but because be a catholic and no catholic have ever be elect president the real issue in this campaign have be obscure perhaps deliberately in some quarter less responsible than this so be apparently necessary for to state once again — not what kind of church believe in for that should be important only to but what kind of america believe in believe in an america where the separation of church and state be absolute where no catholic prelate would tell the president should be catholic how to act and no protestant minister would tell parishioner for whom to vote where no church or church school be grant any public fund or political preference and where no man be deny public office merely because religion differ from the president who may appoint or the people who may elect believe in an america that be officially neither catholic protestant nor jewish where no public official either request or accept instruction on public policy from the pope the|national|council|of|church or any other ecclesiastical source where no religious body seek to impose will directly or indirectly upon the general populace or the public act of official and where religious liberty be so indivisible that an act against church be treat as an act against all for while this|year may be a catholic against whom the finger of suspicion be point in other|years have be and may someday be again a jew — or a quaker — or a unitarian — or a baptist be virginia 's harassment of baptist preacher for example that help lead to jefferson 's statute of religious freedom today may be the victim but tomorrow may be until the whole fabric of harmonious society be rip at a time of great national peril finally believe in an america where religious intolerance will someday end where all man and all church be treat as equal where every man have the same right to attend or not attend the church of choice where there be no catholic vote no anti - catholic vote no bloc voting of any kind — and where catholics protestants and jews at both the lay and pastoral level will refrain from those attitude of disdain and division which have so often mar work in the past and promote instead the american ideal of brotherhood that be the kind of america in which believe and represent the kind of presidency in which believe a great office that must neither be humble by make the instrument of any religious group nor tarnish by arbitrarily withhold occupancy from the member of any religious group believe in a president whose religious view be own private affair neither impose by upon the nation or impose by the nation upon as a condition to hold that office would not look with favor upon a president work to subvert the first amendment 's guarantee of religious liberty nor would system of check and balance permit to do so — and neither do look with favor upon those who would work to subvert article vi of the constitution by require a religious test even by indirection for if disagree with that safeguard should be out openly work to repeal want a chief executive whose public act be responsible to all group and obligate to none who can attend any ceremony service or dinner office may appropriately require of and whose fulfillment of presidential oath be not limit or condition by any religious oath ritual or obligation this be the kind of america believe in — and this be the kind fight for in and the kind brother die for in europe no one suggest then that may have a divided

the shrine visit today the alamo for side by side with bowie and crockett die mccafferty and bailey and carey — but no one know whether be catholics or not for there be no religious test at the alamo ask tonight to follow in that tradition to judge on the basis of record of in congress — on declared stand against an ambassador to the vatican against unconstitutional aid to parochial school and against any boycott of the public school which have attend myself)—instead of judge on the basis of these pamphlet and publication all have see that carefully select quotation out of context from the statement of catholic church leader usually in other country frequently in other|centuries and always omit of course the statement of the|american|bishop in which strongly endorse church state separation and which more nearly reflect the view of almost every american|catholic do not consider these other quotation bind upon public act why should but let say with respect to other country that be wholly opposed to the state be use by any religious group catholic or protestant to compel prohibit or persecute the free exercise of any other religion and hope that and condemn with equal fervor those nation which deny presidency to protestants and those which deny to catholics and rather than cite the misdeed of those who differ would cite the record of the|catholic|church in such nation as ireland and france — and the independence of such statesman as adenauer and but let stress again that these be view for contrary to common newspaper usage be not the catholic candidate for president be the|democratic|party 's candidate for president who happen also to be a catholic do not speak for church on public matter and the church do not speak for whatever issue may come before as president — in birth control divorce censorship gambling or any other subject will make decision in accordance with these view in accordance with what conscience tell to be the national interest and without regard to outside religious pressure or dictate and no power or threat of punishment could cause to decide otherwise but if the time should ever come — and do not concede any conflict to be even remotely possible when office would require to either violate conscience or violate the national interest then would resign the office and hope any conscientious public servant would do the same but do not intend to apologize for these view to critic of either catholic or protestant faith nor do intend to disavow either view or church in order to win this election if should lose on the real issue shall return to seat in the senate satisfy that have try good and be fairly judge but if this election be decide on the basis that americans lose chance of be president on the|day be baptize then be the whole nation that will be the loser in the eye of catholics and non - catholics around the world in the eye of history and in the eye of own people but if on the other hand should win the election then shall devote every effort of mind and spirit to fulfil the oath of the presidency practically identical may add to the oath have take for in the congress for without reservation can solemly swear that will faithfully execute the office of president of the|united|state and will to the good of ability preserve protect and defend the constitution so help god view transcript transcript governor

succor to those in need but the new frontier of which speak be not a set of promise be a set of challenge sum up not what intend to offer the american people but what intend to ask of appeal to pride

unsolved problem of peace and war unconquered pocket of ignorance and prejudice unanswered question of poverty and surplus would be easy to shrink back from that frontier to look to the safe

can have faith in the future only if have faith in for the harsh fact of the matter be that stand on this frontier at a turning point in history must prove all over again whether this nation or any

matter deem to be of grave importance to country in forthcoming state of the|union|message shall review the international situation generally there be worldwide hope which can reasonably entertain and there be worldwide responsibility which must carry to make certain that freedom include own may be secure there be however a special situation in the|middle|east which feel should even now lie before before do so be well to remind that basic national objective in international affair remain peace a world peace base on justice such a peace must include all area all people of the world if be to be endure there be no nation great or small with which would refuse to negotiate in mutual good faith with patience and in the determination to secure a well understanding between out of such understanding must and eventually will grow confidence and trust indispensable ingredient to a program of peace and to plan for lift from all the burden of expensive armament to promote these objective government work tirelessly day by day month by month year by year but until a degree of success crown effort that will assure to all nation peaceful existence must in the interest of peace remain vigilant alert and strong i. the|middle|east have abruptly reach a new and critical stage in long and important history in past|decade many of the country in that area be not fully self govern other nation exercise considerable authority in the area and the security of the region be largely build around power but since the|first|world|war there have be a steady evolution toward self government and independence this development the|united|state have welcome and have encourage country support without reservation the full sovereignty and independence of each and every nation of the|middle|east the evolution to independence have in the main be a peaceful process but the area have be often trouble persistent crosscurrent of distrust and fear with raid back and forth across national boundary have bring about a high degree of instability in much of the|mid|east just recently there have be hostility involve western|european nation that once exercise much influence in the area also the relatively large attack by israel in october have intensify the basic difference between that nation and arab neighbor all this instability have be heighten and at time manipulate by international|communism ii russia 's ruler have long seek to dominate the|middle|east that be true of the czars and be true of the bolsheviks the reason be not hard to find do not affect russia 's security for no one plan to use the|middle|east as a base for aggression against russia never for a moment have the|united|state entertain such a thought the|soviet|union have nothing whatsoever to fear from the|united|state in the|middle|east or anywhere else in the world so long as ruler do not first resort to aggression that statement make solemnly and emphatically neither do russia 's desire to dominate the|middle|east spring from own economic interest in the area russia do not appreciably use or depend upon the|suez|canal in soviet traffic through the canal represent only|about|three fourth of of the total the soviets have no need for and could provide no market for the petroleum resource which constitute the principal natural wealth of the area indeed the|soviet|union be a substantial exporter of petroleum product the reason for russia 's interest in the|middle|east be solely that of power politic consider announce purpose of communize the world be easy to understand hope of dominate the|middle|east this region have always be the crossroad of the continent of the|eastern|hemisphere enable the nation of asia and europe to carry on the commerce that be essential if these country be to maintain well rounded and prosperous economy the|middle|east provide a gateway between eurasia and africa contain about|two|third of the presently know oil deposit of the world and normally supply the petroleum need of many nation of europe asia and africa the nation of europe be peculiarly dependent upon this supply and this dependency relate to transportation as well as to production this have be vividly demonstrate since the closing of the|suez|canal and some of the pipeline alternate way of transportation and indeed alternate source of power can if necessary be develop but these can not be consider as early prospect these thing stress the immense importance of the|middle|east if the nation of that area should lose independence if be dominate by alien force hostile to freedom that would be both a tragedy for the area and for many other free nation whose economic life would be subject to near strangulation western|europe would be endanger just as though there have be no|north|atlantic|treaty|organization the free nation of asia and africa too would be place in serious jeopardy and the country of the|middle|east would lose the market upon which economy depend all this would have the most adverse if not disastrous effect upon own nation 's economic life and political prospect then there be other factor which transcend the material the|middle|east be the birthplace of great religion moslem christian and hebrew mecca and jerusalem be more than place on the map symbolize religion which teach that the spirit have supremacy over matter and that the individual have a dignity and right of which no despotic government can rightfully deprive would be intolerable if the holy place of the|middle|east should be subject to a rule that glorifie atheistic materialism international communism of course seek to mask purpose of domination by expression of good will and by superficially attractive offer of political economic and military aid but any free nation which be the subject of soviet enticement ought in elementary wisdom to look behind the mask remember estonia latvia and lithuania in the|soviet|union enter into mutual assistance pact with these then dependent country and the soviet foreign minister address the|extraordinary|fifth|session of the|supreme|soviet in october|1939 solemnly and publicly declare that stand for the scrupulous and punctilious observance of the pact on the basis of complete reciprocity and declare that all the nonsensical talk about the sovietization of the baltic country be only to the interest of common enemy and of all anti - soviet provocateur yet in estonia latvia and lithuania be forcibly incorporate into the|soviet|union soviet control of the satellite nation of have be forcibly maintain in spite of solemn promise of a contrary intent make during world|war|ii stalin 's death bring hope that this pattern would change and read the pledge of of that the|soviet|union would follow in satellite country the principle of mutual respect for independence and sovereignty and noninterference in domestic affair but have just see the subjugation of hungary by naked armed force in the aftermath of this hungarian tragedy world respect for and belief in soviet promise have sink to a new low international communism need and seek a recognizable success thus have these simple and indisputable fact the|middle|east which have always be covet by russia would today be prize more than ever by international|communism the soviet ruler continue to show that do not scruple to use any mean to gain end the free nation of need and for the most part want add strength to assure continue independence thought naturally turn to the|united|nation as a protector of small nation charter give primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security country have give the|united|nation full support in relation to the hostility in hungary and in egypt the|united|nation be able to bring about a cease fire and withdrawal of hostile force from egypt because be deal with government and people who have a decent respect for the opinion of mankind as reflect in the|united|nations|general|assembly but in the case of hungary the situation be different the|soviet|union veto action by the|security|council to require the withdrawal of soviet armed force from hungary and have show callous indifference to the recommendation even the censure of the|general|assembly the|united|nation can always be helpful but can not be a wholly dependable protector of freedom when the ambition of the|soviet|union be involve iv under all the circumstance have lay before a great responsibility now devolve upon the|united|state have show so that none can doubt dedication to the principle that force shall not be use internationally for any aggressive purpose and that the integrity and independence of the nation of the|middle|east should be inviolate seldom in history have a nation 's dedication to principle be test as severely as ours during recent|weeks there be general recognition in the|middle|east as elsewhere that the|united|states do not seek either political or economic domination over any other people desire be a world environment of freedom not servitude on the other hand many if not all of the nation of the|middle|east be aware of the danger that stem from international communism and welcome close cooperation with the|united|state to realize for the united|nation goal of independence economic well being and spiritual growth if the|middle|east be to continue geographic role of unite rather than separate east and west if vast economic resource be to serve the well being of the people there as well as that of other and if culture and religion and shrine be to be preserve for the uplifting of the spirit of the people then the|united|states must make more evident willingness to support the independence of the freedom love nation of the area v. under these circumstance deem necessary to seek the cooperation of the congress only with that cooperation can give the reassurance need to deter aggression to give courage and confidence to those who be dedicated to freedom and thus prevent a chain of event which would gravely endanger all of the free world there have be several executive declaration make by the|united|state in relation to the|middle|east there be the|tripartite|declaration|of|may|25,|1950 follow by the presidential assurance of october|31,|1950 to the king of saudi arabia there be the presidential declaration of april|9,|1956 that the|united|state will within constitutional mean oppose any aggression in the area there be declaration of november|29,|1956 that a threat to the territorial integrity or political independence of iran iraq pakistan or turkey would be view by the|united|state with the utmost gravity nevertheless weakness in the present situation and the increase danger from international|communism convince that basic united|stat policy should now find expression in joint action by the congress and the executive furthermore joint resolve should be so couch as to make apparent that if nee be word will be back by action vi be nothing new for the president and the congress to join to recognize that the national integrity of other free nation be directly relate to own security have join to create and support the security system of the|united|nation have reinforce the collective security system of the|united|nation by a series of collective defense arrangement today have security treaty with other nation which recognize that peace and security be intertwine have join to take decisive action in relation to greece and turkey and in relation to taiwan thus the|united|stat through the joint action of the president and the congress or in the case of treaty the senate have manifest in many endanger area purpose to support free and independent government and peace — against external menace notably the menace of international communism thereby have help to maintain peace and security during a period of great danger be now essential that the|united|states should manifest through joint action of the president and the congress determination to assist those nation of the mid|east area which desire that assistance the action which propose would have the follow feature would first of all authorize the|united|state to cooperate with and assist any nation or group of nation in the general area of the|middle|east in the development of economic strength dedicate to the maintenance of national independence would in the second place authorize the executive to undertake in the same region program of military assistance and cooperation with any nation or group of nation which desire such aid would in the third place authorize such assistance and cooperation to include the employment of the armed force of the|united|state to secure and protect the territorial integrity and political independence of such nation request such aid against overt armed aggression from any nation control by international communism these measure would have to be consonant with the treaty obligation of the|united|state include the|charter|of the|united|nation and with any action or recommendation of the|united|nation would also if armed attack occur be subject to the overriding authority of the|united|nations|security|council in accordance with the charter the present proposal would in the fourth place authorize the president to employ for economic and defensive military purpose sum available under the|mutual|security|act of as amend without regard to exist limitation the legislation now request should not include the authorization or appropriation of fund because believe that under the condition suggest presently appropriate fund will be adequate for the balance of shall however seek in subsequent legislation the authorization of to be available during each|of|the|fiscal|years|1958 and for discretionary use in the area in addition to the other mutual security program for the area hereafter provide for by the congress vii this program will not solve all the problem of the|middle|east neither do represent the totality of policy for the area there be the problem of palestine and relation between israel and the|arab|state and the future of the arab refugee there be the problem of the future status of the|suez|canal these difficulty be aggravate by international|communism but would exist quite apart from that threat be not the purpose of the legislation propose to deal directly with these problem the|united|nation be actively concern with all these matter and be support the|united|nation the|united|state have make clear notably by secretary dulles ' address of august|26,|1955 that be willing to do much to assist the|united|nation in solve the basic problem of palestine the propose legislation be primarily design to deal with the possibility of communist aggression direct and indirect there be imperative need that any lack of power in the area should be make good not by external or alien force but by the increase vigor and security of the independent nation of the area experience show that indirect aggression rarely if ever succeed where there be reasonable security against direct aggression where the government dispose of loyal security force and where economic condition be such as not to make communism seem an attractive alternative the program suggest deal with all aspect of this matter and thus with the problem of indirect aggression be hope and belief that if purpose be proclaim as propose by the request legislation that very fact will serve to halt any contemplated aggression shall have hearten the patriot who be dedicated to the independence of nation will not feel that stand alone under the menace of great power and should add that patriotism be throughout this area a powerful sentiment be true that fear sometimes pervert true patriotism into fanaticism and to the acceptance of dangerous enticement from without but if that fear can be allay then the climate will be more favorable to the attainment of worthy national ambition and as have indicate will also be necessary for to contribute economically to strengthen those country or group of country which have government manifestly dedicate to the preservation of independence and resistance to subversion such measure will provide the great insurance against communist inroad word alone be not enough viii let refer again to the request authority to employ the armed force of the|united|state to assist to defend the territorial integrity and the political independence of any nation in the area against communist armed aggression such authority would not be exercise except at the desire of the nation attack beyond this be profound hope that this authority would never have to be exercise at all nothing be more necessary to assure this than that policy with respect to the defense of the area be promptly and clearly determine and declare thus the|united|nation and all friendly government and indeed government which be not friendly will know where stand if contrary to hope and expectation a situation arise which call for the military application of the policy which ask the congress to join in proclaim would of course maintain|hour by hour contact with the congress if be in session and if the congress be not in session and if the situation have grave implication would of course at once call the congress into special session in the situation now exist the great risk as be often the case be that ambitious despot may miscalculate if power hungry communists should either falsely or correctly estimate that the|middle|east be inadequately defend may be tempt to use open measure of armed attack if so that would start a chain of circumstance which would almost surely involve the|united|state in military action be convince that the good insurance against this dangerous contingency be to make clear now readiness to cooperate fully and freely with friend of the|middle|east in way consonant with the purpose and principle of the|united|nation intend promptly to send a special mission to the|middle|east to explain the cooperation be prepared to give ix the policy which outline involve certain burden and indeed risk for the|united|state those who covet the area will not like what be propose already be grossly distort purpose however before this americans have see nation 's vital interest and human freedom in jeopardy and fortitude and resolution have be equal to the crisis regardless of hostile distortion of word motif and action indeed the sacrifice of the american people in the cause of freedom have even since the close of world|war|ii be measure in many billions|of|dollar and in thousand of the precious life of youth these sacrifice by which great area of the world have be preserve to freedom must not be throw away in those momentous period of the past the president and the congress have unite without partisanship to serve the vital interest of the|united|state and of the free world the occasion have come for to manifest again national unity in support of freedom and to show deep respect for the right and independence of every nation however great however small seek not violence but peace to this purpose must now devote energy determination view transcript transcript chairman martin delegates and alternates to this great convention distinguished guest and fellow americans wherever may be in this broad land should first tell that have no word in which to express the gratitude that mrs. eisenhower and feel for the warmth of welcome the cordiality have extend to and to the member of family son and daughter brother and wife touch heart deeply thank very much indeed thank additionally and personally for the high honor have accord in entrust once more with nomination for the presidency and should like to say that be a great satisfaction to that the team of individual select in have select to keep intact for this campaign be not here go to attempt a eulogy of mr. nixon have hear qualification describe in the|past|several|days merely want to say this that whatever dedication to country loyalty and patriotism and great ability can do for america will do — and that know lady and gentleman when abraham|lincoln be nominate in and a committee bring the news to at home in springfield illinois reply be sentence long then while friend and neighbor wait in the street and while bonfire light up the may evening say simply and now will not longer defer the pleasure of take and each of by the hand wish could do the same — speak sentence and then take each of by the hand all of who be in sound of voice if could do so would first thank individually for confidence and trust then as be sure lincoln do as move among friend in the light of the bonfire could pause and talk a while about the question that be uppermost in mind be sure that topic would dominate all the rest that topic be the future this be a good time to think about the future for this convention be celebrate hundredth anniversary and a centennial be an occasion not just for recall the inspiring past but even more for look ahead to the demand future just as on new|year's|day instinctively think wonder where will be a year from now so be quite natural for to ask today what will happen not just in the come election but even one|hundred|years|from|now answer be this if and successor be as courageous and forward look and as militantly determine here under the klieg light of the|twentieth|century as abraham|lincoln and associate be in the bonfire light of the nineteenth will continue to grow in the confidence and affection of the american people not only to november next but indeed to and beyond second centennial now of course in this convention set and be momentarily more interested in november|1956 than in but the point be this policy be right today only as be design to stand the test of tomorrow the great norwegian henrik|ibsen once write hold that man be in the right who be most clearly in league with the future today want to demonstrate the truth of a single proposition the|republican|party be hold that the|republican|party and platform be right in because be most closely in league with the future and for this reason and program be and will be decisively approve by the american people in friend have just make a very fiat statement for victory for in november and believe from the bottom of heart but what say be base upon certain assumption and those assumption must become true if the prediction make be to be valid and that be this that every american who believe as do the republicans the independent the straight think democrats must carry the message of the record and the pledge that here make — that have make and here make to all the people of the land must see as do civic duty that not only do vote but that everybody be qualified to vote that everybody register and everybody go to the poll in november here be a task not only for the|republican|national|committee for the woman 's organization for the citizen ' organization for the so call youth for eisenhower — everybody that bear this message in heart must carry to the country in that way will win and which remind friend there be only|a|few|day leave for register in a number of states that be thing can not defer the record show that registration as compare to former year at this time be way down across the land — registration across the board let help the|american|heritage let help the|boy|scout let help everybody to get people out to register to vote now of special relevance and to particularly gratify be the fact that the country 's young people show a consistent preference for this administration after all let not forget these young people be america 's future parenthetically may say shall never cease to hope that the several state will give the voting privilege at a somewhat early age than be now generally the case now the first reason of the shall give why the|republican|party be the|party|of|the|future be this first because be the party of long range principle not short term expediency of predecessor be say to have observe that in make decision have to operate like a football quarterback — could not very well call the next play until see how the last play turn out well that may be a good way to run a football team but in these|days be no way to run a government now why be so important that great governmental program be base upon principle rather than upon shift political opportunism be because what government do affect profoundly the daily life and plan of every person in the country if governmental action be without the solid guideline of endure principle national policy flounder in confusion and more than this the million of individual family and enterprise whose risk taking and plan for the future be country 's very life force be paralyze by uncertainty diffidence and indecision change base on principle be progress constant change without principle become chaos shall give several example of reject expediency in favor of principle first the farm issue expediency say let do something in a hurry anything even multiply price depress surplus at the risk of make the problem twice as bad next year — just so get through this|year people who talk like that do not care about principle and do not know farmer the farmer deal every|day in basic principle of growth and life product must be plan and cultivate and harvest over a long period have to figure not just|a|year at a time but over cycle and span of year as to soil water equipment the strain of stock and the strain on income and so for this man of principle have design program of principle in recognize that have receive from forebear a rich legacy continent 's basic resource of soil be determined that through such measure as and the great plains program this legacy shall be hand on to child even rich than receive be equally determined that farm price and income which be needlessly push down under surplus surplus induce first by war and then by unwise political action that be stubbornly and recklessly prolong shall in the|coming|months and year get back on a genuinely healthy basis this improvement must continue until a rightful share of prosperity be permanently enjoy by agriculture on which very life depend a second example labor relation expediency say when a major labor dispute loom the government must do something anything to settle the dispute even before the party have finish negotiate get an injunction seize the steel mill appoint a board knock head together principle say free collective bargaining without government interference be the cornerstone of the american philosophy of labor management relation if the government charge impatiently into every major dispute the negotiation between party will become a pointless preliminary farce while everyone wait around to see what the government will do this administration have faith in the rightness of the collective bargaining principle believe in the maturity of both labor and business leader and in determination to do what be good not only for own side but for the country as a whole the result for the first time in history a complete steel contract be negotiate and sign without direct government intervention and the|last|three|and|a|half|year have witness of the most remarkable period of labor peace on record another example concentration of power in washington expediency say can not allow fine new idea to be at the mercy of separate state and territorial legislature be so much quick and easy to plan finance and direct all major project from washington principle say geographical balance of power be essential to form of free society if take the centralization shortcut every time something be to be do will perhaps sometimes get quick action but there be no perhaps about the price will pay for impatience the growth of a swollen bureaucratic monster government in washington in whose shadow state and local government will ultimately wither and die and so stem the heedless stampede to washington make a special point of build up state activity state finance and state prestige founding father show how could exercise undoubted responsibility for leadership while still stop short of the kind of interference that deaden local vigor variety initiative and imagination so today say to young people the|party|of|the|future will pass along to undamage the unique system of division of authority which have prove so successful in reconcile old ideal of personal freedom with the twentieth century need for decisiveness in action second reason for say that the|republican|party be the|party|of|the|future be this be the party which concentrate on the fact and issue of today and tomorrow not the fact and issue of yesterday more|than|twenty|years|ago opponent find in the problem of the depression a battleground on which score many political victory now economic cycle have not be eliminate still the world have move on from the 's good time have supplant depression new technique for check serious recession have be learn and test and a whole new array of problem have spring up but obsession with a depression still blind many of opponent to the insistent demand of today the present and the future be bring new kind of challenge to federal and local government water supply highway health housing power development and peaceful us of atomic energy with third of live in big city question of urban organization and redevelopment must be give high priority high of all perhaps will be the priority of first class education to meet the demand of swiftly grow school age population the|party|of|the|young and of all age say let quit fight the battle of the past and let all turn attention to these problem of the present and future on which the longterm well being of people so urgently depend third be the|party|of|the|future because be the party that draw people together not drive apart detest the technique of pitting group against group for cheap political advantage republicans view as a central principle of conduct not just as a phrase on nickel and dime that old motto of e pluribus unum"—"out of many & nbsp our|party as far back as begin establish a record of bring together as large element the work people and small farmer as well as the small businessman attract minority group scholar and writer not to mention reformer of all kind free soilers,|independent|democrats conscience|whigs barnburners soft hunker teetotaller vegetarian and transcendentalist now a|hundred|years|later be again the rallying point for americans of all calling age race and income see in broad forward move straight down the road fight program the good promise for own steady progress toward a bright future some opponent have try to call this a interest party indeed be a interest party and that interest be the interest of every man woman and child in america and most surely as long as the|republican|party continue to be this kind of interest party a universal interest party will continue to be and now the fourth reason the|republican|party be the|party|of|the|future because be the party through which the many thing that still need do will soon be do and will be do by enlist the full energy of free creative individual people republican have prove that be possible for a government to have a warm sensitive concern for the everyday need of people while steer clear of the paternalistic big brother be watch kind of interference the individual and especially the idealistic young person have no faith in a tight federal monopoly on problem solve seek and deserve opportunity for and every other person who be burn to participate in put right the wrong of the world in time of prosperity and progress thing must always be on guard against be smugness true thing be go well but there be thousand of thing still to be do there be still enough needless suffering to be cure enough injustice to be erase to provide career for all the crusader can produce or find want all republicans independent discern democrats — come on in and help one|hundred|years|ago the|republican|party be create in a devout belief in equal justice and equal opportunity for all in a nation of free man and woman what be more the|republican|party 's record on social justice rest not on word and promise but on accomplishment the record show that a wide range of quietly effective action conceive in understanding and good will for all have bring about more genuine and often voluntary progress toward equal justice and opportunity in than be accomplish in all the previous put together elimination of various kind of discrimination in the|armed|service and among the employee of government contractor provide specific example of this progress in this work incidentally no one have be more effective and more energetic than vice president who have head of the great committees in this direction now in all exist kind of discrimination there be much to do must insure a fair chance to such people as mature worker who have trouble get job old citizen with problem of health housing security and recreation migratory farm laborer and physically handicap worker have with also problem involve american|indians low income farmer and laborer woman who sometimes do not get equal pay for equal work small businessman and employer and worker in area which need special assistance for redevelopment specific new program of action be be push for all of these the most recent be a new 14-point program for small businessman which be announce early in august and the everyday well being of people be be advanced on many other front this be be do not by paternalistic regimentation be do by clear cut aggressive federal leadership and by release the illimitable resource and drive of our|million of self reliant individual and thousand of private organization of every conceivable kind and size each of these be consecrate to the task of meet some human need cure some human evil or enrich some human experience finally a|party|of|the|future must be completely dedicate to peace as indeed must all americans for without peace there be no future be in the light of this truth that the|united|stat propose atoms|for|peace|plan in and since then have do so much to make this new science universally available to friendly nation in order to promote human welfare have agreement with more|than|thirty nation for research reactor and with for power reactor while many other be under consideration twenty|thousand|kilograms of nuclear fuel have be set aside for the foreign program in the same way have work unceasingly for the promotion of effective step in disarmament so that the labor of man could with confidence be devote to own improvement rather than waste in the building of engine of destruction no one be more aware than that be the young who fight the war and be the young who give up year of life to military training and service be not enough that elder promise peace in time must be peace in time too and in child 's time indeed friend there be only|one real peace now and that be peace for all time now there be imperative of peace requirement that the prudent man must face with unblinking realism the first imperative be the elementary necessity of maintain own national strength moral economic and military be still conviction as write in the compelling necessity of the moment leave no alternative to the maintenance of real and respectable strength not only in moral rectitude and economic power but in term of adequate military preparedness during the|past|three|and|one half|years military strength have be constantly augment soberly and intelligently country have never before in peacetime be so well prepared militarily so long as the world situation require security must be vigorously sustain economic power as everyone know be display a capacity for growth which be both rapid and sound even while support record military budget must keep grow but moral strength be also essential today be compete for man 's heart and mind and trust all over the world in such a competition what be at home and what do at home be even more important than what say abroad here again friend find constructive work for each of what each of do how each of act have an influence on this question now the second imperative of peace be collective security live in a shrunken world a world in which ocean be cross in hour a world in which a single minded despotism menace the scatter freedom of score of struggle independent nation to ensure the combined strength of friendly nation be for all of an elementary matter of self preservation as elementary as have a stout militia in the|day of the flint lock again the strength speak of be not military strength alone the heart of the collective security principle be the idea of help other nation to realize own potentiality political economic and military the strength of the free world lie not in cement the free world into a second monolithic mass to compete with that of the communist lie rather in the unity that come of the voluntary association of nation which however diverse be develop own capacity and assert own national destiny in a world of freedom and of mutual respect there can be no endure peace for any nation while other nation suffer privation oppression and a sense of injustice and despair in modern world be madness to suppose that there could be an island of tranquillity and prosperity in a sea of wretchedness and frustration for america 's sake as well as the world 's must measure up to the challenge of the second imperative the urgent need for mutual economic and military cooperation among the free nation sufficient to deter or repel aggression wherever may threaten but even this be no longer enough be in the era of the thermo nuclear bomb that can obliterate city and can be deliver across continent with such weapon war have become not just tragic but preposterous with such weapon there can be no victory for anyone plainly the objective now must be to see that such a war do not occur at all and so the third imperative of peace be this without for a moment relax internal and collective defense must actively try to bridge the great chasm that separate from the people under communist rule in those region be million of individual human being who have be friend and who have sincerely want peace and freedom throughout so much of mutual history now for year the iron curtain be impenetrable people be unable to talk to these individual behind the curtain or travel among or share art or sport or invite to see what life be like in a free democracy or even get acquaint in any way what future be there in such a course except great misunderstanding and an ever deepen division in the world of course good will from side can do little to reach these people unless there be some new spirit of conciliation on the part of the government control now at last there appear to be sign that some small degree of friendly intercourse among people may be permit be begin to be able cautiously and with eye open to encourage some interchange of idea of book magazine student tourist artist radio program technical expert religious leader and governmental official the hope be that little by little mistrust base on falsehood will give way to international understanding base on truth now as this development gradually come about will not seem futile for young people to dream of a brave and new and shin world or for old people to feel that can in fact bequeath to child a well inheritance than that which be own science and technology labor save method management labor organization education medicine and not least politic and government all these have bring within grasp a world in which backbreake toil and longer|hours will not be necessary travel all over the world to learn to know brother abroad will be fast and cheap the fear and pain of crippling disease will be greatly reduce the material thing that make life interesting and pleasant will be available to everyone leisure together with educational and recreational facility will be abundant so that all can develop the life of the spirit of reflection of religion of the art of the full realization of the good thing of the world and political wisdom will ensure justice and harmony this picture of the future bring to mind a little story a government worker when first arrive in washington in be pass the|national|archives|building in a taxi where see this motto carve on of pedestal what be past be prologue have hear that washington cab driver be note for know all the washington answer so ask the driver about the motto oh that say the driver that be just bureaucrat talk what really mean is—'you be not see nothing yet friend the kind of era have describe be possible but will not be attain by revolution will not be attain by the sordid politic of pitting group against group will be bring about by the ambition and judgment and inspiration and daring of free americans work together and with friend abroad toward a common ideal in a peaceful world lincoln speak to the|republican|state|convention in begin with the biblical quotation a house divide against can not stand today the world be a house divide but as be sometimes forget — lincoln follow this quotation with a note of hope for troubled country do not expect the house to fall say but do expect will cease to be divide a|century|later too must have the vision the fighting spirit and the deep religious faith in creator 's destiny for to sound a similar note of promise for divided world that out of time there can with incessant work and with god 's help emerge a new era of good life good will and good hope for all man american put this way every tomorrow have handle can take hold of with the handle of anxiety or the handle of faith friend in firm faith and in the conviction that the republican purpose and principle be in league with this kind of future the nomination that have tender for the presidency of the|united|state now humbly but confidently accept view transcript transcript madame president member of the|general|assembly when secretary general|hammarskjold 's invitation to address this|general|assembly reach in bermuda be just begin a series of conference with the prime ministers and foreign ministers of great|britain and of france subject be some of the problem that beset world during the remainder of the|bermuda|conference have constantly in mind that ahead of lie a great honor that honor be today as stand here privilege to address the|general|assembly|of|the|united|nation at the same time that appreciate the distinction of address have a sense of exhilaration as look upon this assembly never before in history have so much hope for so many people be gather together in a single organization deliberation and decision during these|somber|year have already realize part of those hope but the great test and the great accomplishment still lie ahead and in the confident expectation of those accomplishment would use the office which for the time be hold to assure that the|government|of|the|united|state will remain steadfast in support of this body this shall do in the conviction that will provide a great share of the wisdom the courage and the faith which can bring to this world last peace for all nation and happiness and well being for all man clearly would not be fitting for to take this occasion to present to a unilateral american report on bermuda nevertheless assure that in deliberation on that lovely island seek to invoke those same great concept of universal peace and human dignity which be so clearly etch in charter neither would be a measure of this great opportunity merely to recite however hopefully pious platitude therefore decide that this occasion warrant saying to some of the thing that have be on the mind and heart of legislative and executive associate and on for a great many month thought have originally plan to say primarily to the american people know that the american people share deep belief that if a danger exist in the world be a danger share by all and equally that if hope exist in the mind of nation that hope should be share by all finally if there be to be advance any proposal design to ease even by the small measure the tension of today 's world what more appropriate audience could there be than the member of the|general|assembly|of|the|united|nation feel impelled to speak today in a language that in a sense be new which who have spend so much of life in the military profession would have prefer never to use that new language be the language of atomic warfare the atomic age have move forward at such a pace that every citizen of the world should have some comprehension at least in comparative term of the extent of this development of the utmost significance to every of clearly if the people of the world be to conduct an intelligent search for peace must be armed with the significant fact of today 's existence recital of atomic danger and power be necessarily state in term for these be the only incontrovertible fact that know need hardly point out to this assembly however that this subject be global not merely national in character on july|16,|1945 the|united|states set off the world 's first atomic explosion since that date in the|united|states|of|america have conduct test explosion atomic bomb today be more|than|25 time as powerful as the weapon with which the atomic age dawn while hydrogen weapon be in the range of millions|of|ton of tnt equivalent today the|united|state ' stockpile of atomic weapon which of course increase daily exceed by many time the explosive equivalent of the total of all bomb and all shell that come from every plane and every gun in every theatre of war in all of the year of world|war|ii a single air group whether afloat or land base can now deliver to any reachable target a destructive cargo exceed in power all the bomb that fall on britain in all of world|war|ii in size and variety the development of atomic weapon have be no less remarkable the development have be such that atomic weapon have virtually achieve conventional status within armed service in the|united|state the army the navy the|air|force and the|marine|corp be all capable of put this weapon to military use but the dread secret and the fearful engine of atomic might be not alone in the first place the secret be possess by friend and ally great|britain and canada whose scientific genius make a tremendous contribution to original discovery and the design of atomic bomb the secret be also know by the|soviet|union the|soviet|union have inform that over recent|years have devote extensive resource to atomic weapon during this period the|soviet|union have explode a series of atomic device include at|least|one involve thermo nuclear reaction if at time the|united|state possess what may have be call a monopoly of atomic power that monopoly cease to exist therefore although early start have permit to accumulate what be today a great quantitative advantage the atomic reality of today comprehend fact of even great significance first the knowledge now possess by several nation will eventually be share by other possibly all other second even a vast superiority in number of weapon and a consequent capability of devastating retaliation be no preventive of against the fearful material damage and toll of human life that would be inflict by surprise aggression the free world at least dimly aware of these fact have naturally embark on a large program of warning and defense system that program will be accelerate and expand but let no one think that the expenditure of vast sum for weapon and system of defense can guarantee absolute safety for the city and citizen of any nation the awful arithmetic of the atomic bomb do not permit of any such easy solution even against the most powerful defense an aggressor in possession of the effective minimum number of atomic bomb for a surprise attack could probably place a sufficient number of bomb on the choose target to cause hideous damage should such an atomic attack be launch against the|united|state reaction would be swift and resolute but for to say that the defense capability of the|united|state be such that could inflict terrible loss upon an aggressor for to say that the retaliation capability of the|united|state be so great that such an aggressor 's land would be lay waste all this while fact be not the true expression of the purpose and the hope of the|united|state to pause there would be to confirm the hopeless finality of a belief that atomic colossi be doom malevolently to eye each other indefinitely across a trembling world to stop there would be to accept helplessly the probability of civilization destroy the annihilation of the irreplaceable heritage of mankind hand down to generation from generation and the condemnation of mankind to begin all over again the age old struggle upward from savagery toward decency and right and justice surely no sane member of the human race could discover victory in such desolation could anyone wish name to be couple by history with such human degradation and destruction occasional page of history do record the face of the great destroyers but the whole book of history reveal mankind 's never end quest for peace and mankind 's god give capacity to build be with the book of history and not with isolated page that the|united|states will ever wish to be identify country want to be constructive not destructive want agreement not war among nation want to live in freedom and in the confidence that the people of every other nation enjoy equally the right of choose own way of life so country 's purpose be to help move out of the dark chamber of horror into the light to find a way by which the mind of man the hope of man the soul of man everywhere can move forward toward peace and happiness and well be in this quest know that must not lack patience know that in a world divide such as ours today salvation can not be attain by dramatic act know that many step will have to be take over many|months before the world can look at and truly realize that a new climate of mutually peaceful confidence be abroad in the world but know above all else that must start to take these step now the|united|state and ally great|britain and france have over the|past|months try to take some of these step let no one say that shun the conference table on the record have long stand the request of the|united|state great|britain and france to negotiate with the|soviet|union the problem of a divide germany on that record have long stand the request of the same nation to negotiate an austrian peace treaty on the same record still stand the request of the|united|nation to negotiate the problem of korea most recently have receive from the|soviet|union what be in effect an expression of willingness to hold a four power meeting along with ally great|britain and france be pleased to see that this note do not contain the unacceptable precondition previously put forward as already know from joint bermuda communique the|united|state great|britain and france have agree promptly to meet with the|soviet|union the government of the united states approach this conference with hopeful sincerity will bend every effort of mind to the single purpose of emerge from that conference with tangible result toward peace the only true way of lessen international tension never have never will propose or suggest that the|soviet|union surrender what be rightfully will never say that the people of russia be an enemy with whom have no desire ever to deal or mingle in friendly and fruitful relationship on the contrary hope that this come conference may initiate a relationship with the|soviet|union which will eventually bring about a free intermingling of the people of the east and of the|west — the one sure human way of develop the understanding require for confident and peaceful relation instead of the discontent which be now settle upon eastern|germany occupy austria and the country of seek a harmonious family of free european nation with none a threat to the other and least of all a threat to the people of russia beyond the turmoil and strife and misery of asia seek peaceful opportunity for these people to develop natural resource and to elevate life these be not idle word or shallow vision behind lie a story of nation lately come to independence not as a result of war but through free grant or peaceful negotiation there be a record already write of assistance gladly give by nation of the west to needy people and to those suffer the temporary effect of famine drought and natural disaster these be deed of peace speak more loudly than promise or protestation of peaceful intent but do not wish to rest either upon the reiteration of past proposal or the restatement of past deed the gravity of the time be such that every new avenue of peace no matter how dimly discernible should be explore there be new avenue of peace which have not yet be well explore an avenue now lay out by the|general|assembly|of|the|united|nation in resolution of this|general|assembly suggest and quote—"that the|disarmament|commission study the desirability of establish a sub committee consisting of representative of the powers principally involve which should seek in private an acceptable solution and report on such a solution to the|general|assembly and to the|security|council not the|united|state heed the suggestion of the|general|assembly|of|the|united|nation be instantly prepared to meet privately with such other country as may be principally involved to seek an acceptable solution to the atomic armament race which overshadow not only the peace but the very life of the world shall carry into these private or diplomatic talk a new conception the|united|state would seek more than the mere reduction or elimination of atomic material for military purpose be not enough to take this weapon out of the hand of the soldier must be put into the hand of those who will know how to strip military casing and adapt to the art of peace the|united|state know that if the fearful trend of atomic military buildup can be reverse this great of destructive force can be develop into a great boon for the benefit of all mankind the|united|state know that peaceful power from atomic energy be no dream of the future that capability already prove be here — now today who can doubt if the entire body of the world 's scientist and engineer have adequate amount of fissionable material with which to test and develop idea that this capability would rapidly be transform into universal efficient and economic usage to hasten the|day when fear of the atom will begin to disappear from the mind of people and the government of the east and west there be certain step that can be take now therefore make the following proposal the government principally involve to the extent permit by elementary prudence to begin now and continue to make joint contribution from stockpile of normal uranium and fissionable material to an|international|atomic|energy|agency would expect that such an agency would be set up under the aegis of the|united|nation the ratio of contribution the procedure and other detail would properly be within the scope of the private conversation have refer to earlier the|united|state be prepared to undertake these exploration in good faith any partner of the|united|state act in the same good faith will find the|united|state a not unreasonable or ungenerous associate undoubtedly initial and early contribution to this plan would be small in quantity however the proposal have the great virtue that can be undertake without the irritation and mutual suspicion incident to any attempt to set up a completely acceptable system of world wide inspection and control the|atomic|energy|agency could be make responsible for the impounding storage and protection of the contribute fissionable and other material the ingenuity of scientist will provide special safe condition under which such a bank of fissionable material can be make essentially immune to surprise seizure the more important responsibility of this|atomic|energy|agency would be to devise method whereby this fissionable material would be allocate to serve the peaceful pursuit of mankind expert would be mobilize to apply atomic energy to the need of agriculture medicine and other peaceful activity a special purpose would be to provide abundant electrical energy in the power starve area of the world thus the contribute power would be dedicate some of strength to serve the need rather than the fear of mankind the|united|state would be more than willing would be proud to take up with other principally involve the development of plan whereby such peaceful use of atomic energy would be expedite of those principally involved the|soviet|union must of course be would be prepared to submit to and with every expectation of approval any such plan that would first — encourage world wide investigation into the most effective peacetime us of fissionable material and with the certainty that have all the material need for the conduct of all experiment that be appropriate second begin to diminish the potential destructive power of the world 's atomic stockpile third allow all people of all nation to see that in this enlighten age the great power of the earth both of the east and of the west be interested in human aspiration first rather than in build up the armament of war fourth — open up a new channel for peaceful discussion and initiate at least a new approach to the many difficult problem that must be solve in both private and public conversation if the world be to shake off the inertia impose by fear and be to make positive progress toward peace against the dark background of the atomic bomb the|united|state do not wish merely to present strength but also the desire and the hope for peace the|coming|month will be fraught with fateful decision in this assembly in the capital and military headquarter of the world in the heart of man everywhere be governor or govern may be the decision which will lead this world out of fear and into peace to the making of these fateful decision the united|stat pledge before and therefore before the world determination to help solve the fearful atomic dilemma to devote entire heart and mind to find the way by which the miraculous inventiveness of man shall not be dedicated to death but consecrate to life again thank the delegate for the great honor have do in invite to appear before and in listen to so courteously thank view transcript transcript in this|spring|of|1953 the free world weigh question above all other the chance for a just peace for all people to weigh this chance be to summon instantly to mind another recent moment of great decision come with that yet more hopeful spring of bright with the promise of victory and of freedom the hope of all just man in that moment too be a just and last peace the|8|year that have pass have see that hope waver grow dim and almost die and the shadow of fear again have darkly lengthen across the world today the hope of free man remain stubborn and brave but be sternly discipline by experience shun not only all crude counsel of despair but also the self deceit of easy illusion weigh the chance for peace with sure clear knowledge of what happen to the vain hope of in that|spring of victory the soldier of the western|ally meet the soldier of russia in the center of europe be triumphant comrade in arm people share the joyous prospect of building in honor of dead the only fitting monument an age of just peace all these war weary people share too this concrete decent purpose to guard vigilantly against the domination ever again of any part of the world by a single unbridle aggressive power this common purpose last an instant and perished the nation of the world divide to follow distinct road the|united|state and value friend the other free nation choose road the leader of the|soviet|union choose another the way choose by the|united|state be plainly mark by a few clear precept which govern conduct in world affair first no people on earth can be hold as a people to be an enemy for all humanity share the common hunger for peace and fellowship and justice second no nation 's security and well being can be lastingly achieve in isolation but only in effective cooperation with fellow nation third any nation 's right to a form of government and an economic system of own choosing be inalienable fourth any nation 's attempt to dictate to other nation form of government be indefensible and fifth a nation 's hope of last peace can not be firmly base upon any race in armament but rather upon just relation and honest understanding with all other nation in the light of these principle the citizen of the|united|state define the way propose to follow through the aftermath of war toward true peace this way be faithful to the spirit that inspire the|united|nation to prohibit strife to relieve tension to banish fear this way be to control and to reduce armament this way be to allow all nation to devote energy and resource to the great and good task of heal the war 's wound of clothing and feeding and housing the needy of perfect a just political life of enjoy the fruit of own free toil the soviet government hold a vastly different vision of the future in the world of design security be to be find not in mutual trust and mutual aid but in force huge army subversion rule of neighbor nation the goal be power superiority at all cost security be to be seek by deny to all other the result have be tragic for the world and for the|soviet|union have also be ironic the amassing of soviet power alert free nation to a new danger of aggression compel in self defense to spend unprecedented money and energy for armament force to develop weapon of war now capable of inflict instant and terrible punishment upon any aggressor instill in the free nation and let none doubt this the unshakable conviction that as long as there persist a threat to freedom must at any cost remain armed strong and ready for the risk of war inspire and let none doubt this to attain a unity of purpose and will beyond the power of propaganda or pressure to break now or ever there remain however thing essentially unchanged and unaffected by soviet conduct the readiness of the free nation to welcome sincerely any genuine evidence of peaceful purpose enable all people again to resume common quest of just peace the free nation most solemnly and repeatedly have assure the|soviet|union that firm association have never have any aggressive purpose whatsoever soviet leader however have seem to persuade or try to persuade people otherwise and so have come to pass that the|soviet|union have share and suffer the very fear have foster in the rest of the world this have be the way of life forge by of fear and force what can the world or any nation in hope for if no turning be find on this dread road the bad to be fear and the good to be expect can be simply state the bad be atomic war the good would be this a life of perpetual fear and tension a burden of arm drain the wealth and the labor of all people a wasting of strength that

into ethiopia and do not act the nazis march into the rhineland into austria into czechoslovakia and free man be paralyze for lack of strength and unity and will think about|those|years of weakness and indecision and the|world|war|ii which be evil result then think about the speed and courage and decisiveness with which have move against the communist threat since world|war|ii the first crisis come in and when the|soviet|union refuse to honor agreement to remove troop from iran member of cabinet come to and ask if be ready to take the risk that a firm stand involve reply that be so take stand — make clear to the|soviet|union that expect to honor agreement and the soviet troop be withdraw from iran then in early|1947 the|soviet|union threaten greece and turkey the british send a message say could no longer keep force in that area something have to be do at once or the eastern mediterranean would be take over by the communists on march|12th go before the congress and state determination to help the people of greece and turkey maintain independence today greece be still free and independent and turkey be a bulwark of strength at a strategic corner of the world then come the marshall plan which save europe the heroic berlin airlift and military aid program inaugurate the|north|atlantic|pact the rio|pact bind the|western|hemisphere together and the defense pact with country of the|far|pacific most important of all act in korea be in independence missouri in june|1950 when secretary acheson telephone and give the news about the invasion of korea tell the secretary to lay the matter at once before the|united|nation and come on back to washington fly back over the flatland of the|middle|west and over the appalachians that summer afternoon have a lot of time to think turn the problem over in mind in many way but thought keep come back to the|1930' — to|manchuria to ethiopia the rhineland austria and finally to munich here be history repeat here be another probe action another testing action if let the|republic|of|korea go under some other country would be next and then another and all the time the courage and confidence of the free world would be ebb away just as do in the 's and the|united|nation would go the way of when reach washington meet immediately with the secretary of state the secretary of defense and general bradley and the other civilian and military official who have information and advice to help decide on what to do talk about the problem long and hard consider those problem very carefully be not easy to make the decision to send american boy again into battle be a soldier in the|first|world|war and know what a soldier go through know well the anguish that mother and father and family go through so know what be ahead if act in korea but after all this be say realize that the issue be whether there would be fight in a limited area now or on a much large scale later on whether there would be some casualty now or many more casualty later so a decision be reach the decision believe be the most important in time as president of the|united|state in the|day that follow the most heartening fact be that the american people clearly agree with the decision and in korea man be fight as valiantly as americans have ever fight — because know be fight in the same cause of freedom in which americans have stand ever since the beginning of the republic where free man have fail the test before this time meet the test meet firmly meet successfully the aggression have be repel the communists have see hope of easy conquest go down the drain the determination of free people to defend have be make clear to the kremlin as have think about worldwide struggle with the communists these|past|8|years day in and|day out — have never once doubt that the people of country have the will to do what be necessary to win this terrible fight against communism know the people of this country have that will and determination and have always depend on because have be sure of that have be able to make necessary decision even though call for sacrifice by all of and have not be wrong in judgment of the american people that same assurance of people 's determination will be general|eisenhower 's great source of strength in carry on this struggle now once in a while get a letter from some impatient person ask why do not get over with why do not issue an ultimatum make all out war drop the atomic bomb for most americans the answer be quite simple be not make that way be a moral people peace be goal with justice and freedom can not of own free will violate the very principle that be strive to defend the whole purpose of what be do be to prevent world war iii start a war be no way to make peace but if anyone still think that just this once bad mean can bring good end then let remind of this be live in the|8th|year of the atomic age be not the only nation that be learn to unleash the power of the atom a third world war may dig the grave not only of communist opponent but also of own society world as well as start an atomic war be totally unthinkable for rational man then some of may ask when and how will the cold war end think can answer that simply the communist world have great resource and look strong but there be a fatal flaw in society be a godless system a system of slavery there be no freedom in no consent the iron curtain the secret police the constant purge all these be symptom of a great basic weakness the ruler ' fear of own people in the long run the strength of free society and ideal will prevail over a system that have respect for neither god nor man last|week in state of the union message to the congress — and hope will all take the time to read explain how think will finally win through as the free world grow strong more united more attractive to man on both side of the iron curtain — and as the soviet hope for easy expansion be block then there will have to come a time of change in the soviet world nobody can say for sure when that be go to be or exactly how will come about whether by revolution or trouble in the satellite state or by a change inside the kremlin whether the communist ruler shift policy of own free will — or whether the change come about in some other way — have not a doubt in the world that a change will occur have a deep and abide faith in the destiny of free man with patience and courage shall some|day move on into a new era a wonderful golden age an age when can use the peaceful tool that science have forge for to do away with poverty and human misery everywhere on earth think what can be do once capital skill science most of all atomic energy can be release from the task of defense and turn wholly to peaceful purpose all around the world there be no end to what can be do can not help but dream out loud just a little here the tigris and euphrates|valley can be make to bloom as do in the time of babylon and nineveh israel can be make the country of milk and honey as be in the time of joshua there be a plateau in ethiopia some|6,000|to|8,000|feet high that have of land just exactly like the corn belt in northern illinois enough food can be raise there to feed people there be place in — place in colombia and venezuela and brazil — just like that plateau in ethiopia — place where food could be raise for million of people these thing can be do and be self liquidate project if can get peace and safety in the world under the|united|nation the development will come so fast will not recognize the world in which now live this be dream of the future picture of the world hope to have when the communist threat be overcome have talk a lot tonight about the menace of communism and fight against because that be the

send adlai|stevenson to the|white|house and will have 4|more|year of good government and prosperity thank very much view transcript transcript fellow americans come before tonight as a candidate for the vice presidency and as a man whose honesty and integrity have be question the usual political thing to do when charge be make against be to either ignore or to deny without give detail believe have have enough of that in the|united|state particularly with the present administration in washington d.c. to the office of the vice presidency of the|united|state be a great office and feel that the people have get to have confidence in the integrity of the man who run for that office and who may obtain have a theory too that the good and only answer to a smear or to an honest misunderstanding of the fact be to tell the truth and that be why be here tonight want to tell side of the case be sure that have read the charge and have hear that senator nixon take from a group of supporter now be that wrong and let say that be wrong i'm say incidentally that be wrong and not just illegal because be not a question of whether be legal or illegal that be not enough the question be be morally wrong say that be morally wrong if any of that go to senator nixon for personal use say that be morally wrong if be secretly give and secretly handle and say that be morally wrong if any of the contributor get special favor for the contribution that make and now to answer those question let say this not one|cent of the or any other money of that type ever go to for personal use every penny of be use to pay for political expense that do not think should be charge to the taxpayer of the|united|state be not a secret fund as a matter of fact when be on meet|the|press some of may have see last|sunday — peter|edson come up to after the program and say dick what about this fund hear about and say well there be no secret about go out and see dana|smith who be the administrator of the fund and give address and say that will find that the purpose of the fund simply be to defray political expense that do not feel should be charge to the government and third let point out and want to make this particularly clear that no contributor to this fund no contributor to any of campaign have ever receive any consideration that would not have receive as an ordinary constituent just do not believe in that and can say that never while have be in the senate of the|united|state as far as the people that contribute to this fund be concern have make a telephone call for to an agency or have go down to an agency in behalf and the record will show that the record which be in the hand of the administration but then some of will say and rightly well what do use the fund for senator why do have to have let tell in just a word how a senate office operate first of all a senator get a year in salary get enough money to pay for trip a year a round trip that be for and family between home and washington d.c. and then get an allowance to handle the people that work in office to handle mail and the allowance for state of california be enough to hire people and let say incidentally that that allowance be not pay to the senator be pay directly to the individual that the senator put on payroll but all of these people and all of these allowance be for strictly official business business for example when a constituent write in and want to go down to the|veterans|administration and get some information about gi policy item of that type for example but there be other expense which be not cover by the government and think can best discuss those expense by ask some question do think that when or any other senator make a political speech have print should charge the printing of that speech and the mailing of that speech to the taxpayer do think for example when or any other senator make a trip to home state to make a purely political speech that the cost of that trip should be charge to the taxpayer do think when a senator make political broadcast or political television broadcast radio or television that the expense of those broadcast should be charge to the taxpayer well know what answer be be the same answer that audience give whenever discuss this particular problem the answer be no the taxpayer should not be require to finance item which be not official business but which be primarily political business but then the question arise say well how do pay for l these and how can do legally and there be several way that can be do incidentally and that be do legally in the|united|states senate and in the congress the first way be to be a rich man do not happen to be a rich man so could not use that one another way that be use be to put wife on the payroll let say incidentally opponent opposite number for the vice presidency on the democratic ticket do have wife on the payroll and have have on payroll for the|ten|year the past year now just let say this that be business and be not critical of for do that will have to pass judgment on that particular point but have never do that for this reason have find that there be so many deserve stenographer and secretary in washington that need the work that just do not feel be right to put wife on the payroll wife 's sit over here be a wonderful stenographer use to teach stenography and use to teach shorthand in high school that be when meet and can tell folk that be work many|hours|at|night|and|many|hours on saturdays and sundays in office and be do a fine job and be proud to say tonight that in the|six|year have be in the house and the senate of the|united|state pat|nixon have never be on the government payroll there be other way that these finance can be take care of some who be lawyer and happen to be a lawyer continue to practice law but have not be able to do that be so far away from california that have be so busy with senatorial work that have not engage in any legal practice and also as far as law practice be concern seem to that the relationship between an attorney and the client be personal that could not possibly represent a man as an attorney and then have an unbiased view when present case to in the event that have before the government and so feel that the good way to handle these necessary political expense of get message to the american people and the speech make the speech that have print for the most part concern this message — of expose this administration the communism in the corruption in the only way that could do that be to accept the aid which people in home state of california who contribute to campaign and who continue to make these contribution after be elect be glad to make and let say be proud of the fact that not of have ever ask for a special favor be proud of the fact that not of have ever ask to vote on a bill other than as own conscience would dictate and be proud of the fact that the taxpayer by subterfuge or otherwise have never pay dime for expense which think be political and should not be charge to the taxpayer let say incidentally that some of may say well that be all right senator that be explanation but have get any proof7 and would like to tell this evening that just|about|an|hour|ago receive an independent audit of this entire fund suggest to gov. sherman|adams who be the chief of staff of the dwight|eisenhowe campaign that an independent audit and legal report be obtain and have that audit here in hand be an audit make by the|price,|waterhouse|&amp co. firm and the legal opinion by gibson,|dunn|&amp crutcher lawyer in los|angeles the big law firm and incidentally of the good one in los|angeles be proud to be able to report to tonight that this audit and this legal opinion be be forward to general|eisenhower and would like to read to the opinion that be prepare by gibson,|dunn|&amp crutcher and base on all the pertinent law and statute together with the audit report prepare by the certify public accountant be conclusion that senator nixon do not obtain any financial gain from the collection and disbursement of the fund by dana|smith that senator nixon do not violate any federal or state law by reason of the operation of the fund and that neither the portion of the fund pay by dana|smith directly to third person nor the portion pay to senator nixon to reimburse for designated office expense constitute income to the senator which be either reportable or taxable as income under applicable tax law sign crutcher by alma|h.|conway now that friend be not nixon speak but that be an independent audit which be request because want the american people to know all the fact and be not afraid of have independent people go in and check the fact and that be exactly what do but then realize that there be still some who may say and rightly so and let say that recognize that some will continue to smear regardless of what the truth may be but that there have be understandably some honest misunderstanding on this matter and there be some that will say well maybe be able senator to fake this thing how can believe what say after all be there a possibility that maybe get some sum in cash be there a possibility that may have feather own nest and so now what be go to do and incidentally this be unprecedented in the history of american politic be go at this time to give this television and radio audience a complete financial history everything have earn everything have spend everything owe and want to know the fact will have to start early be bear in family be of modest circumstance and most of early life be spend in a store out in east|whittier be a grocery store of those family enterprise only reason be able to make go be because mother and dad have boy and all work in the store work way through college and to a great extent through law school and then in probably the good thing that ever happen to happen marry pat — who be sit over here have a rather difficult time after be marry like so many of the young couple who may be listen to practice law continue to teach school then in go into the service let say that service record be not a particularly unusual one go to guess be entitle to a couple of battle star get a couple of letter of commendation but be just there when the bomb be fall and then return return to the|united|state and in run for the congress when come out of the war pat and pat during the war ad work as a stenographer and in a bank and as an economist for government agency and when come out the total of saving from both law practice teaching and all the time that as in the war the total for that entire period be just a little less than every cent of that incidentally be in government bond well that be where start when go into politic now what have earn since go into politic well here be jot down let read the note first of all have have salary as a congressman and as a senator second have receive a total in this|past|six|year of from estate which be in law firm the time that sever connection with and incidentally as say before have not engage in any legal practice and have not accept any fee from business that come to the firm after go into politic have make an average of approximately|$1500 a year from nonpolitical speaking engagement and lecture and then fortunately have inherit a little money pat sell interest in father 's estate for and inherit l500 from grandfather live rather modestly for four|year live in an apartment in park|fairfax in alexandria virginia the rent be a month and save for the time that could buy a house now that be what take in what do do with this money what do have today to show for this will surprise because be so little suppose as standard generally go of people in public life first of all have get a house in washington which cost and on which owe have a house in whittier california which cost and on which owe folk be live there at the present time have just|$4,000 in life insurance plus g.i. policy which have never be able to convert and which will run out in two|year have no insurance whatever on pat have no life insurance on youngster patricia and julie own a oldsmobile car have furniture have no stock and bond of any type have no interest of any kind direct or indirect in any business now that be what have what do owe well in addition to the mortgage the mortgage on the house in washington the on the house in whittier owe to the|riggs|bank in washington d.c. with interest per cent owe to parent and the interest on that loan which pay regularly because be the part of the saving make through the|year be work so hard pay regularly interest and then have a loan which have on life insurance well that be about that be what have and that be what owe be not very much but pat and have the satisfaction that every dime that have get be honestly ours should say this that pat do not have a mink coat but do have a respectable republican cloth coat and always tell that would look good in anything other thing probably should tell because if do not will probably be say this about too do get something a gift after the election a man down in texas hear pat on the radio mention the fact that youngster would like to have a dog and believe or not the|day|before leave on this campaign trip get a message from union|station in baltimore say have a package for go down to get know what be be a little cocker spaniel dog in a crate that would send all the way from texas black and white spot and little girl tricia the old name checkers and know the kid like all kid love the dog and just want to say this right now that regardless of what say about be go to keep be not easy to come before a nation wide audience and air life as have do but want to say some thing before conclude that think most of will agree on mr. mitchell the chairman of the|democratic|national|committee make the statement that if a man could not afford to be in the|united|states senate should not run for the senate and just want to make position clear do not agree with mr. mitchell when say that only a rich man should serve government in the united|states senate or in the congress do not believe that represent the thinking of and know that do not represent the thinking of believe that be fine that a man like governor stevenson who inherit a fortune from father can run for president but also feel that be essential in this country of our that a man of modest mean can also run for president because know remember abraham|lincoln remember what say god must have love the common people make so many of and now be go to suggest some course of conduct first of all have read in the paper about other fund now mr. stevenson apparently have a couple of in which a group of business people pay and help to supplement the salary of state employee here be where the money go directly into pocket and think that what mr. stevenson should do be come before the american people as have give the name of the people that have contribute to that fund give the name of the people who put this money into pocket at the same time that be receive money from state government and see what favor if any ave out for that do not condemn mr. stevenson for what do but until the fact be in there be a doubt that will be raise and as far as mr. sparkman be concern would suggest the same thing be have wife on the payroll do not condemn for that but think that should come before the american people and indicate what outside source of income have have would suggest that under the circumstance both mr. parkman and mr. stevenson should come before the american people as have and make a complete financial statement as to financial history and if do not will be an admission that have something to hide and think that will agree with because folk remember a man that be to be president of the|united|state a man that be to be vice president of the|united|state must have the confidence of all the people and that be why be do what be do and that be why suggest that mr. stevenson and mr. sparkman since be under attack should do what be do now let say this know that this be not the last of the smear in spite of explanation tonight other smear will be make other have be make in the past and the purpose of the mear know be this — to silence to make let up well just do not know who be deal with be go tell this remember in of the hiss case some of the same columnist some of the same radio commentator who be attack now and misrepresent position be violently oppose at the time be after alger|hiss but continue the fight because know be right and an say to this great television and radio audience that have no pologie to the american people for part in put alger|his vhere be today and as far as this be concern intend to continue the fight why do feel so deeply why do feel that in spite of the mear the misunderstanding the necessity for a man to come up here and bare soul as have why be necessary for to continue this fight and want to tell why because see love country and think country be in danger and think that the only man that can save america at this time be the man that be run for president on ticket dwight eisenhower say why do think be in danger and say look at the record seven|year of the|truman acheson|administration and that be happen six|hundred|million people lose to the communists and a war in korea in which have lose american casualty and say to all of that a policy that result in a loss of people to the communists and a war which cost american casualty be not good enough for america and say that those in that make the mistake which cause that war and which result in those loss should be kick out of the|state|department just as fast as can get out of there and let say that know mr. stevenson will not do that because defend the truman policy and know that dwight|eisenhower will do that and that will give america the leadership that need take the problem of corruption have read about the mess in washington mr. stevenson can not clean up because be pick by the man truman under whose administration the mess be make would not trust a man who make the mess to clean up— that be truman and by the same token can not trust the man who be pick by the man that make the mess to clean up — and that be stevenson and so say eisenhower who owe nothing to truman nothing to the big city boss be the man that can clean up the mess in washington take communism say that as far as that subject be concern the danger be great to america in the hiss case get the secret which enable to break the american secret state|department code get secret in the atomic bomb case which enable to get the secret of the atomic bomb five|years before would have get by own device and say that any man who call the alger|hiss case a red herring be not fit to be president of the|united|state say that a man who like mr. stevenson have pooh poohe and ridicule the communist threat in the|united|state — say that be phantom among be accuse that have attempt to expose the communists of look for communists in the|bureau|of|fisheries and wildlife say that a man who say that be not qualified to be president of the|united|state and say that the only man who can lead in this fight to rid the government of both those who be communists and those who have corrupt this government be eisenhower because eisenhower can be sure recognize the problem and know how to deal with now let say that finally this|evening want to read to just briefly excerpt from a letter which receive a letter which after all this be over no one can take away from read as follow dear senator nixon since be only|19|years|of|age can not vote in this presidential election but believe if could and general|eisenhower would certainly get vote husband be in the fleet marines in korea be a corpsman on the front line and have a month old son be never see and feel confident that with great americans like and general eisenhower in the|white|house lonely americans like will be unite with love one now in korea only pray to god that will not be too late enclose be a small check to help in campaign live on a month be all can afford at present but let know what else can do folk be a check for and be one that will never cash and just let say this hear a lot about prosperity these|day but say why can not have prosperity build on peace rather than prosperity build on war why can not have prosperity and an honest government in washington d.c. at the same time believe can and eisenhower be the man that can lead this crusade to bring that kind of prosperity and now finally know that wonder whether or not be go to stay on the republican ticket or resign let say this do not believe that ought to quit because be not a quitter and incidentally pat be not a quitter after all name be patricia|ryan and be bear on st.|patrick's|day and know the irish never quit but the decision friend be not mine would do nothing that would harm the possibility of dwight|eisenhower to become president of the|united|state and for that reason be submit to the|republican|national|committee tonight through this television broadcast the decision which be to make let decide whether position on the ticket will help or hurt and be go to ask to help decide wire and write the|republican|national|committee whether think should stay on or whether should get off and whatever decision be will abide by but just let say this last word regardless of what happen be go to continue this fight be go to campaign up and down america until drive the crook and the communists and those that defend out of washington and remember folk eisenhower be a great man believe be a great man and a vote for eisenhower be a vote for what be good for america view transcript transcript mr. chairman mr. vice president mr. speaker mr. chairman of the|democratic|committee distinguished guest and fellow democrats be very happy to be here tonight this make jefferson jackson dinner that have speak to in the city of washington hope to attend several more in capacity or another have all be wonderful dinner of the thing like about the dinner be the fact that be political meeting like political meeting and like politic politic — good politic be public service there be no life or occupation in which a man can find a great opportunity to serve community or country have be in politic more|than|30|year and know that nothing else could have give great satisfaction have have a career from precinct to president and be a little bit proud of that career be sure all of here tonight be very much interested in the presidential election this|year in view of that fact think would give a little analysis of the political situation as see the political situation in this country may look complicated but can find the key to in a simple thing the republicans have be out of office for and be desperate to get back in office so can control the country again for 20|year the republicans have be wander in a political desert like camel look for an oasis do not drink the same thing that camel do though and if do not find pretty soon the|republican|party may die out altogether and know would just hate to see that happen would like to help keep alive if that be at all possible so be go to offer a little advice about the error of way there be some very good reason why the republicans have be out of office so long and have not be able to get back in control the first reason be that be vote out in because have bring the country to the brink of ruin in the 's the republican administration draw back in petrified isolation from world responsibility spend all time try to help the rich get rich and pay no attention to the welfare of the worker and the farmer all in all pave the way for the big economic smashup this country have ever see that be the reason the republicans be throw out of office in and of the very good reason why have be keep out ever since people do not want any more great|depression the second reason why the republicans have be out of office for be that have be give the country good government instead of try to build up the prosperity of the favor few and let some of trickle down to the rest have be work to raise the income of the vast majority of the people and have be steadily expand the base for prosperity and freedom in this country the people have keep right on reelect democrats because have be serve well and know the third reason the republicans have be keep out of power for an|year be because have never be able to agree on a sensible program to put before the country have be on almost every side of every question but have seldom or never be on the right side in say the new deal be terrible and be against and all work and in the election that fall just lose by a landslide in admit there may be some good in some part of the new deal but say need a republican to run and be overwhelmingly beat again in the republicans say the new deal may have be good in its|day but have get old and tired and be no good any more but the people do not agree and the republicans be snow under once more now in say well as a matter of fact by be so sure of win that really do not bother to take a position on anything and get just exactly what deserve get another good licking and by now the republicans can not figure out what to do every day hear a new republican theory of how to win the election of theory have be that ought to come right out and say be against all advance the country have make since this be the kind of dinosaur school of republican strategy want to go back to prehistoric time republicans of this school say let stop beat about the bush and let say what really believe let say be against social security and be against the labor union and good wage and be oppose to price support for farmer that be against the government do anything for anybody except big business now have a lot of sympathy for these republicans have be hush up for a long time would certainly be happy if could tell the truth for once and campaign for what really believe would be good for soul but would not be good for party or for the country either this dinosaur school of republican strategy would only get the dinosaur vote and there be not many of leave except over at the smithsonian next there be the republican theory that the republicans can win if oppose the foreign policy of the|united|state can not agree among as to how want to oppose but most of want to oppose somehow some republicans seem to think would be popular to pull out of korea and to abandon europe and to let the united|nation go to smash reason this way the american people be not very bright let tell do not have to build up defense or serve in the army or strengthen ally overseas if fall for that then republicans will be in and that be all that matter the trouble with the republican theory be that the american people be a lot smart than the republicans who think up the american people have learn a lot from world war and from the|last|7|years of work to keep the peace know that as long as communism be loose in the world must have ally and must resist aggression the american people be live in the atomic age and know that the idea of the stone age will not work any more if ever do work and there be another group of republicans who attack foreign policy by advocate the all out or let get over with theory these be the republicans who say want to expand the fighting in korea and start drop atomic bomb and invite a new world war figure be good politic to talk that way do not stop to count the cost think people do not understand that the hard and brave thing in the world be to work for peace and not for war but if war come and god forbid that come if the showdown come these loud talker would be the first people to run for the bomb shelter and the voter know none of these republican theory of how to win the election hold much promise of success this|year all show be that the platform that the republicans write in chicago in july will have to be a fearful and wonderful thing to cover all these different theory will have to be a big tent than the ringling|brothers circus and will have to cover just about as many freak have even become fashionable for the republican candidate to saw in half and put part on each side of the fence that would fit under the tent too the real republican campaign be not go to be fight on the issue the republicans be go to wage a campaign of phony propaganda be go to try what may call the white be black and the black be white strategy the reasoning behind be this the republicans know that the nation be strong and prosperous that be build up defense against communism that the democratic administration have work for the good of the people the only chance for the republicans therefore be to make the people think the fact be not so the job for the republicans be to make people believe that white be black and black be white this be a pretty difficult way to win an election would not appeal to anybody but very desperate republican politician but the republicans have some reason for think may succeed will have the support of most of the press and most of the radio commentator and may have the professional poll taker with again as be in the republicans as always will have a lot of money have slick advertising expert and do not have too many scruple about how use remember that carpetbagger from chicago who get convict for the way elect a republican senator in maryland in will try that all over the country the republicans be all set to try this white be black technique and this be the way will work first of all will try to make people believe that everything the government have do for the country be socialism will go to the people and say do see that social security check receive the other day think that be good for do not that be just too bad that be nothing in the world but socialism do see that new flood control dam the government be build over there for the protection of property sorry that be awful socialism that new hospital that be build be socialism price support more socialism for the farmer minimum wage law socialism for labor socialism be bad for friend everybody know that and here be with new car and home and well opportunity for the kid and a television set be just surround by socialism now the republicans say that be a terrible thing friend and the only way out of this sinkhole of socialism be to vote for the republican ticket and if do that will probably have a garage and no car a crystal radio set and no television and probably not even a garage to live in but a secondhand tent out on the lawn do not believe people be go to be fool into that condition because go through once before now do think can sell that bill of good this country today have more freedom for all people than any country in the history of the world and all the effort of all the republican politician can not convince the people that this be socialism the next part of this white be black campaign be to try to make people believe that be in favor of communism that be an even tough job

transcript transcript fellow americans want to talk to plainly tonight about what be do in korea and about policy in the|far|east in the simple term what be do in korea be this be try to prevent a third world war think most people in this country recognize that fact and warmly support the decision of the government to help the|republic|of|korea against the communist aggressor now many person even some who applaud decision to defend korea have forget the basic reason for action be right for to be in korea now be right be right today want to remind why this be true the communists in the kremlin be engage in a monstrous conspiracy to stamp out freedom all over the world if be to succeed the|united|states would be number among principal victim must be clear to everyone that the|united|stat cannot and will not — sit idly by and await foreign conquest the only question be what be the good time to meet the threat and how be the good way to meet the good time to meet the threat be in the beginning be easy to put out a fire in the beginning when be small than after have become a roar blaze and the good way to meet the threat of aggression be for the peace love nation to act together if do not act together be likely to be pick off by if have follow the right policy in the 1930' if the free country have act together to crush the aggression of the dictator and if have act in the beginning when the aggression be small — there probably would have be no world|war|ii if history have teach anything be that aggression anywhere in the world be a threat to the peace everywhere in the world when that aggression be support by the cruel and selfish ruler of a powerful nation who be bent on conquest become a dear and present danger to the security and independence of every free nation this be a lesson that most people in this country have learn thoroughly this be the basic reason why join in create the|united|nation and since the end of world|war|ii have be put that lesson into practice — have be work with other free nation to check the aggressive design of the|soviet|union before can result in a third world war that be what do in greece when that nation be threaten by the aggression of international communism the attack against greece could have lead to general war but this country come to the aid of greece the|united|nation support greek resistance with help the determination and effort of the greek people defeat the attack on the spot another big communist threat to peace be the berlin blockade that too could have lead to war but again be settle because free man would not back down in an emergency the aggression against korea be the bold and most dangerous move the communists have yet make the attack on korea be part of a great plan for conquer all of asia would like to read to from a secret intelligence report which come to after the attack on korea be a report of a speech a communist army officer in north|korea give to a group of spy and saboteur last|may before south|korea be invade the report show in great detail how this invasion be part of a carefully prepared plot here in part be what the communist officer who have be train in moscow tell man force say be schedule to attack south|korean force about the middle of june the come attack on south|korea mark the first step toward the liberation of asia notice that use the word liberation this be communist double talk meaning conquest have another secret intelligence report here this one tell what another communist officer in the|far|east tell man several|month before the invasion of korea here be what say in order to successfully undertake the long await world revolution must first unify asia lava indochina malaya india tibet thailand philippines and japan be ultimate target the|united|state be the only obstacle on road for the liberation of all the country in southeast asia in other word must unify the people of asia and crush the|united|state again liberation in commie language mean conquest that be what the communist leader be tell people and that be what have be try to do want to control all asia from the kremlin this plan of conquest be in flat contradiction to what believe believe that korea belong to the koreans believe that india belong to the indians believe that all the nation of asia should be free to work out affair in own way this be the basis of peace in the|far|east and be the basis of peace everywhere else the whole communist imperialism be back of the attack on peace in the|far|east be the|soviet|union that train and equip the|north|korean for aggression the|chinese communists mass well train and well equip division on the korean frontier these be the troop throw into battle when the north|korean communists be beat the question have have to face be whether the communist plan of conquest can be stop without a general war government and other country associate with in the|united|nation believe that the good chance of stop without a general war be to meet the attack in korea and defeat there that be what have be do be a difficult and bitter task but so far have be successful so far have prevent world war iii so far by fight a limited war in korea have prevent aggression from succeed and bring on a general war and the ability of the whole free world to resist communist aggression have be greatly improve have teach the enemy a lesson have find that aggression be not cheap or easy moreover man all over the world who want to remain free have be give new courage and new hope know now that the champion of freedom can stand up and fight and that will stand up and fight resolute stand in korea be help the force of freedom now fight in indochina and other country in that part of the world have already slow down the timetable of conquest in korea there be sign that the enemy be build up ground force for a new mass offensive also know that there have be large increase in the enemy 's available air force if a new attack come feel confident will be turn back the united|nation fight force be tough and able and well equipped be fight for a just cause be prove to all the world that the principle of collective security will work be proud of all these force for the magnificent job have do against heavy odd pray that effort may succeed for upon success may hinge the peace of the world the communist side must now choose course of action the communist ruler may press the attack against may take further action which will spread the conflict have that choice and with the awful responsibility for what may follow the communists also have the choice of a peaceful settlement which could lead to a general relaxation of the tension in the|far|east the decision be because the force of the|united|nation will strive to limit the conflict if possible do not want to see the conflict in korea extend be try to prevent a world war not to start and the good way to do that be to make plain that and the other free country will continue to resist the attack but may ask why can not take other step to punish the aggressor why do not bomb manchuria and china why do not assist the chinese nationalist troop to land on the mainland of china if be to do these thing would be run a very grave risk of start a general war if that be to happen would have bring about the exact situation be try to prevent if be to do these thing would become entangled in a vast conflict on the continent of asia and task would become immeasurably more difficult all over the world what would suit the ambition of the kremlin better than for military force to be commit to a full scale war with red|china may well be that in spite of good effort the communists may spread the war but would be wrong tragically wrong for to take the initiative in extend the war the danger be great make no mistake about behind the|north|korean and chinese|communist in the front line stand additional million of chinese soldier and behind the chinese stand the tank the plane the submarine the soldier and the scheme ruler of the|soviet|union aim be to avoid the spread of the conflict the course have be follow be the best calculate to avoid an all out war be the course consistent with obligation to do all can to maintain international peace and security experience in greece and berlin show that be the most effective course of action can follow first of all be clear that effort in korea can blunt the will of the chinese communists to continue the struggle the united|nation force have put up a tremendous fight in korea and have inflict very heavy casualty on the enemy force be strong now than have be before these be plain fact which may discourage the chinese communists from continue attack second the free world as a whole be grow in military strength every|day in the|united|state in western|europe and throughout the world free man be alert to the soviet threat and be build defense this may discourage the communist ruler from continue the war in korea — and from undertake new act of aggression elsewhere if the communist authority realize that can not defeat in korea if realize would be foolhardy to widen the hostility beyond korea then may recognize the folly of continue aggression a peaceful settlement may then be possible the door be always open then may achieve a settlement in korea which will not compromise the principle and purpose of the|united|nation have think long and hard about this question of extend the war in asia have discuss many time with the ablest military adviser in the country believe with all heart that the course be follow be the good course believe that must try to limit the war to korea for these vital reason to make sure that the precious life of fighting man be not waste to see that the security of country and the free world be not needlessly jeopardize and to prevent a third world war a number of event have make evident that general macarthur do not agree with that policy have therefore consider essential to relieve general macarthur so that there would be no doubt or confusion as to the real purpose and aim of policy be with the deep personal regret that find compel to take this action general macarthur be of great military commander but the cause of world peace be much more important than any individual the change in command in the|far|east mean no change whatever in the policy of the|united|state will carry on the fight in korea with vigor and determination in an effort to bring the war to a speedy and successful conclusion the new commander lt . gen. matthew|ridgway have already demonstrate that have the great quality of military leadership need for this task be ready at any time to negotiate for a restoration of peace in the area but will not engage in appeasement be only interested in real peace real peace can be achieve through a settlement base on the follow factor the fighting must stop concrete step must be take to insure that the fighting will not break out again there must be an end to the aggression a settlement found upon these element would open the way for the unification of korea and the withdrawal of all foreign force in the meantime want to be clear about military objective be fight to resist an outrageous aggression in korea be try to keep the korean conflict from spread to other area but at the same time must conduct military activity so as to insure the security of force this be essential if be to continue the fight until the enemy abandon ruthless attempt to destroy the|republic|of|korea that be military objective to repel attack and to restore peace in the hard fighting in korea be prove that collective action among nation be not only a high principle but a workable mean of resist aggression defeat of aggression in korea may be the turning point in the world 's search for a practical way of achieve peace and security the struggle of the|united|nation in korea be a struggle for peace free nation have unite strength in an effort to prevent a third world war that war can come if the communist ruler want to come but this nation and

republican platform ought to get some action from a short session of the 80th congress can do this job in if want to do will still have time to go out and run for office be go to try to dodge responsibility be go to drag all the red herring can across this campaign but be here to say that senator barkley and be not go to let get away with now what that bad 80th congress do in this special session will be the test the american people will not decide by listen to mere word or by read a mere platform will decide on the record the record as have be write and in the record be the stark truth that the battle line of be the same as be in when the nation lie prostrate and helpless as a result of republican misrule and inaction in be attack the citadel of special privilege and greed be fight to drive the money changer from the temple today in be now the defender of the stronghold of democracy and of equal opportunity the haven of the ordinary people of this land and not of the favor class or the powerful few the battle cry be just the same now as be in and paraphrase the word of franklin|d.|roosevelt as issue the challenge in accept nomination in chicago this be more than a

transcript fellow countryman at noon today send to congress a message veto the taft hartley labor bill veto this bill because be convince be a bad bill be bad for labor bad for management and bad for the country have hope that the congress would send a labor bill could sign have say before and say now that need legislation to correct abuse in the field of labor relation last|january make specific recommendation to the congress as to the kind of labor legislation should have immediately urge that the congress provide for a commission to be make up of representative of the congress the public labor and management to study the entire field of labor management relation and to suggest what additional law should have believe that proposal be accept by the great majority of people as fair and just if the congress have accept those recommendation would have today the basis for improve labor management relation would gladly have sign a labor bill if have take in the right direction of stable peaceful labor relation even though may not have be draw up exactly as wish would have sign a bill with some doubtful feature if take as a whole have be a good bill but the taft hartley bill be a shocking piece of legislation be unfair to the work people of this country clearly abuse the right which million of citizen now enjoy to join together and bargain with employer for fair wage and fair working condition under no circumstance could have sign this bill the restriction that this bill place on worker go far beyond what people have be lead to believe this be no innocent bill be interesting to note that on june|4 congressman hartley on the floor of the|house|of|representatives make the follow statement and quote be go to find there be more in this bill than may meet the eye that be a revealing description of this bill by of author there be so much more in than the people have be lead to believe that be sure that very few understand what the taft hartley bill would do if should become law that be why be speak to tonight want to know the real meaning of this bill have all be tell by proponent that this be a moderate bill have be tell that the bill be harsh and drastic when be first pass by the|house|of|representatives but that the senate have persuade the house to drop out the harsh provision and that the final bill the bill send to — be mild and moderate but find no truth in the claim that the bill send to be mild or moderate find that the basic purpose and much of the language of the original house|of|representatif bill be still in the final bill in fact the final bill follow the provision of the original house bill in at|least|36 separate place have all be tell that the taft hartley bill be favorable to the wage earner of this country have be claim that worker need to be save from own folly and that this bill would provide the mean of salvation some people have call this bill the worker ' bill of right let see what this bill really would do to workingman the bill be deliberately design to weaken labor union when the sponsor of the bill claim that by weaken union be give right back to individual workingman ignore the basic reason why union be important in democracy union exist so that labor man can bargain with employer on a basis of equality because of union the living standard of work people have increase steadily until be today the high in the world a bill which would weaken union would undermine national policy of collective bargaining the taft hartley bill would do just that would take back in the direction of the old evil of individual bargaining would take the bargaining power away from the worker and give more power to management this bill would even take away from workingman some bargaining fight which enjoy before the|wagner|act be pass if weaken system of collective bargaining weaken the position of every workingman in the country this bill would again expose worker to the abuse of labor injunction would make union liable for damage suit for action which have long be consider lawful this bill would treat all union alike union which have fine record with long year of peaceful relation with management would be hurt by this bill just as much as the few troublemaker the country need legislation which will get rid of abuse do not need — and do not want legislation which will take fundamental right away from work people have be tell that the taft hartley bill be a means by which the country can be protect from nationwide strike in vital industry the term of the bill do not support this claim many people be under the impression that this bill would prevent or settle a strike in the coal industry sincerely trust that the coal operator and the miner will soon come to an agreement on the term of a contract and that there will be no interruption of coal mining but if the miner and the operator do not reach agreement and if this bill should become law be likely that the most that could be accomplish under the complicated procedure of the bill would be postponement of a strike from july until october under this bill a work stoppage in the coal mine may be prevent for and then if agreement have not be reach the miner would be free to strike and would be mandatory for the president to refer the whole matter to congress even if congress be not in session postpone a strike in the coal industry until the approach of winter when need for coal be acute be certainly not the way to protect the nation against the danger of a shortage of coal the bill would not aid fair and early settlement of dispute in vital industry have be tell by the supporter of the taft hartley bill that would reduce industrial strife on the contrary be convinced that would increase industrial strife the bill would soon upset security clause in thousand of exist agreement between labor and management these agreement be mutually arrive at and furnish a satisfactory basis for relation between worker and employer provide stability in industry with present type of agreement outlaw by this bill the party would have to find a new basis for agreement the restriction in this bill would make the process of reach new agreement a long and bitter the bill would increase industrial strife because a number of provision deprive worker of legal protection of fundamental right would then have no means of protect these right except by strike the bill would open up opportunity for endless law suit by employer against union and by union against employer for example would make employer vulnerable to an immense number of law suit since grievance however minor could be take into court by dissatisfied worker insofar as employer be concern predict that if this bill should become law would regret the|day that be conceive be load with provision that would plague and hamper management be fill with hidden legal trap that would take labor relation out of the plant where belong and place in the court another defect be that in try to correct labor abuse the taft hartley bill go so far that would threaten fundamental democratic freedom provision undertake to prevent political contribution and expenditure by labor organization and corporation this provision would forbid a union newspaper from comment on candidate in national election may well prevent an incorporated radio network from spend any money in connection with the national convention of a political party may even prevent the|league|of|women|voter which be incorporate — from use fund to inform member about the record of a political candidate regard this provision of the taft hartley bill as a dangerous challenge to free speech and free press of the basic error of this bill be that ignore the fact that over the|year have be make real progress in labor management relation have be achieve slow but steady improvement in cooperation between employer and worker must always remember that under free economic system management and labor be associate work together for own benefit and for the benefit of the public the taft hartley bill fail to recognize these fundamental fact many provision of the bill would have the result of change employer and worker from member of the same team to opponent on contend team feel deep concern about what this would do to the steady progress have make through the|year fear that this type of legislation would cause the people of country to divide into oppose group if conflict be create as this bill would create if the seed of discord be sow as this bill would sow unity will suffer and strength will be impair this bill do not resemble the labor legislation which have recommend to the congress the whole purpose of this bill be contrary to the sound growth of national labor policy there be still time to enact progressive constructive legislation during the present session need such legislation to correct abuse and to further advance in labor management relation seek in this country today a formula which will treat all man fairly and justly and which will give people security in the necessity of life as generous american spirit prompt to aid the world to rebuild must
