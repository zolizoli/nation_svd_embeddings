stone governor as be well aware the question of war and peace have emerge as a central issue in this campaign in the give and take of recent|weeks president carter be be criticize for respond late to aggressive soviet impulse for insufficient buildup of armed|force and a paralysis in deal with afghanistan and iran have be criticize for be all too quick to advocate the use of lot of muscle military action to deal with foreign crisis specifically what be the difference between the of on the us of american military power governor reagan do not know what the difference may be because do not know what mr. carter 's policy be do know what have say about and be only here to tell that believe with all heart that first priority must be world peace and that use of force be always and only a last resort when everything else have fail and then only with regard to national security now believe also that this meeting this mission this responsibility for preserve the peace which believe be a responsibility peculiar to country that can not shirk responsibility as the leader of the|free|world because be the only that can do and therefore the burden of maintain the peace fall on and to maintain that peace require strength america have never get in a war because be too strong can get into a war by let event get out of hand as have in the|last|3 year under the foreign policy of this administration of mr. carter 's until be face each time with a crisis and good management in preserve the peace require that control the event and try to intercept before become a crisis but have see war in lifetime be a father of son have a grandson do not ever want to see another generation of young americans bleed life into sandy beachhead in the pacific or rice paddy and jungle in asia or the muddy bloody battlefield of europe mr smith mr. stone do have a followup question for the governor mr stone yes governor have be hear that the defense buildup that would associate with would cost tens|of|billions|of|dollar more than be now contemplate in assume that the american people be ready to bear this cost nevertheless keep ask the following question how do reconcile huge increase in military outlay with promise of substantial tax cut and of balance the budget which in this|fiscal|year the one that just end run more|than|$60|billion in the red governor reagan mr. stone have submit an economic plan that have work out in concert with a number of fine economist in this country all of whom approve and believe that over a projection this plan can permit the extra spending for need refurbishing of defensive posture that can provide for a balanced budget by if not earlier and that can afford along with the cut that have propose in government spending can afford the tax cut have propose and probably mainly because mr. carter 's economic policy have build into the|next|5|years and on beyond that a tax increase that will be take more next|year out of the people 's pocket than be take this|year and tax cut do not come close to eliminate that increase be only reduce the amount of the increase in other word what be talk about be not put government back to get less money than government be be get but simply cut the increase in spending mr smith the same question now go to president garter president carter would like to have the question repeat the president yes mr stone yes president carter the question of war and peace a central issue in this campaign have be criticize in the give and take for respond late to aggressive soviet impulse for an insufficient buildup of armed|force and a paralysis in deal with afghanistan and iran governor reagan on the other hand have be criticize for be all too quick to advocate the use of lot of muscle military action to deal with foreign crisis such as mention specifically what be the difference between the of on the us of american military power the president mr. stone have have to make thousand of decision since have be president serve in the|oval|office and with each of those decision that affect the future of country have learn in the process think be a much wise and more experienced man than be when debate against president ford have also learn that there be no simple answer to complicated question h.|l.|mencken say that for every problem there be a simple answer would be neat and plausible and wrong the fact be that this nation in before become president have own military strength decrease out of eight|year the budget commitment for defense go down in all since have be in office have have a steady carefully plan methodical but very effective increase in commitment for defense but what have do be to use that enormous power and prestige and military strength of the|united|state to preserve the peace have not only keep peace for own country but have be able to extend the benefit of peace to other in the|middle|east have work for a peace treaty between israel and egypt successfully and have tie together with israel and egypt in a common defense capability this be a very good step forward for nation 's security and will continue to do as have do in the past may also add that there be decision that be make in the oval office by every president which be profound in nature there be always troublespot in the world and how those troubled area be address by a president alone in that oval|office affect nation directly the involvement of the|united|state and also american interest that be a basic decision that have to be make so frequently by every president who serve that be what have try to do successfully by keep country at peace mr smith mr. stone do have a followup on mr stone yes would like to be a little more specific on the use of military power and let talk about area for a moment under what circumstance would use military force to deal with for example a shutoff of persian oil gulf if that should occur or to counter russian expansion beyond afghanistan into either iran or pakistan ask this question in view of charge that be woefully unprepared to project sustain and emphasize the word sustain â€” power in that part of the world the president mr. stone in state of the union address earlier|this|year point out that any threat to the stability or security of the|persian|gulf would be a threat to the security of own country in the past have not have an adequate military presence in that region now have major carrier task force have access to facility in different area of that region and have make clear that work with ally and other that be prepared to address any foreseeable eventuality which may interrupt commerce with that crucial area of the world but in do this have make sure that address this question peacefully not inject american military force into combat but let the strength of nation be feel in a beneficial way this believe have assure that interest will be protect in the|persian|gulf|region as have do in the|middle|east and throughout the world mr smith governor reagan have a minute to comment or rebut governor reagan well yes question the figure about the decline in defense spending under the previous administration in the precede to this administration would call to attention that be in a war that wind down during those|8|year which of course make a change in military spending because of turn from war to peace also would like to point out that republican president in those|years face with a democratic majority in both houses of the congress find that request for defense budget be very often cut now gerald|ford leave a project plan for a military buildup to restore defense and president garter 's administration reduce that by cut ship out of the navy building program that have be propose and stop the b-1 delay the cruise missile stop the production line for the|minuteman missile delay the trident submarine and now be plan a mobile military force that can be deliver to various spot in the world which do make question assault on whether be the one that be quick to look for use of force mr smith president carter have the last word on this question the president well there be various element of defense be to control nuclear weapon which hope will get to later on because that be the most important single issue in this campaign another one be how to address troubled area of the world think habitually governor reagan have advocate the injection of military force into troubled area when and predecessor both democrats and republicans â€” have advocate resolve those trouble and those difficult area of the world peacefully diplomatically and through negotiation in addition to that the buildup of military force be good for country because have get to have military strength in order to preserve the peace but will always remember that the good weapon be the one that be never fire in combat and the good soldier be who never have to lay life down on the field of battle strength be imperative for peace but the must go hand in hand mr smith thank gentleman the next question be from harry|ellis to president carter the nation 's economy mr ellis mr. president when be elect in the consumer price index stand at now stand at more|than|12|percent perhaps more significantly the nation 's broad underlie inflation rate have go up from now a part of that be due to external factor beyond u.s. control notably the more than double of oil price by opec last|year because the|united|state remain vulnerable to such external shock can inflation in fact be control if so what measure would pursue in a second term the president again be important to put the situation into perspective in have a so call oil shock wherein the price of opec oil be raise to an extraordinary degree have an even bad oil shock in in have the bad recession the deep and most penetrate recession since the recession that result this time be the brief have have since in addition have bring down inflation earlier|this|year the|first|quarter do have a very severe inflation pressure bring about by the opec price increase average about|18|percent the|first|quarter|of|this|year the|second|quarter have drop down to about|13|percent the most recent figure the|last|3|months or the|third|quarter|of|this|year the inflation rate be 7|percent still too high but illustrate very vividly that in addition to provide an enormous number of job new job in the|last|3|1/2|years that the inflationary threat be still urgent on notice that governor reagan recently mention the reagan kemp roth proposal which own running mate george|bush describe as voodoo economic and say that would result in a 30-percent inflation rate and business|week which be not a democratic publication say that this reagan kemp roth proposal and quote think be completely irresponsible and would result in inflationary pressure which would destroy this nation so proposal be very sound and very carefully consider to stimulate job to improve the industrial complex of this country to create tool for american worker and at the same time would be anti - inflationary in nature so to add new job to control inflation and to plan for the future with the energy policy now intact as a foundation be plan for the|years|ahead mr smith mr. ellis do have a followup question for mr. carter mr ellis yes mr. president have mention the creation of new job the president yes mr ellis at the same time the unemployment rate still hang high as do the inflation rate now wonder can tell what additional policy would pursue in a second administration in order to try to bring down that inflation rate and would be an act of leadership to tell the american people be go to have to sacrifice to adopt a lean lifestyle for some time to come the president yes have demand that the american people sacrifice and have do very well as a matter of fact be import today about|one third less oil from overseas than do just a year ago have have a 25-percent reduction since the|first|year be in office at the same time as say earlier have add about|9|million net new job in that period of time a record never before achieve also the new energy policy have be predicate on factor conservation which require sacrifice and the other one increase in production of american energy which be go along very well more coal this|year than ever before in history more oil and gas well drill this|year than ever before in history the new economic revitalization program that have in mind which will be implement next|year would result in tax credit which would let business invest in new tool and new factory to create even more new job about a in the|next|2|years and also have plan a youth employment program which would encompass job for young people this have already pass the house now have an excellent prospect to pass the senate mr smith now the same question go to governor reagan governor reagan would like to have the question repeat governor reagan yes please mr ellis governor reagan during the|past|4|years the consumer price index have rise from to currently over|12|percent and perhaps more significantly the nation 's broad underlie rate of inflation have go up from now a part of that have be due to external factor beyond u.s. control and notably the more than double of opec oil price last|year which lead to ask whether since the|united|state remain vulnerable to such external shock can inflation in fact be control if so specifically what measure would pursue governor reagan mr. ellis think this idea that have be spawn here in country that inflation somehow come upon like a plague and therefore be uncontrollable and no one can do anything about be entirely spurious and be dangerous to say this to the people when mr. carter become president inflation be as say have be cut in by president gerald|ford be now run at president carter also have speak of the new job create well always with the normal growth in country and increase in population increase the number of job but that can not hide the fact that there be man and woman out of work in america today and of those lose job in just|the|last|few|months mr. carter have also promise that would not use unemployment as a tool to fight against inflation and yet economic message state that would reduce productivity and gross national product and increase unemployment in order to get a handle on inflation because in january at be more|than|18|percent since then have blame to the people for inflation opec be blame the|federal|reserve|system have blame the lack of productivity of the american people have then accuse the people of live too well and that must share in scarcity must sacrifice and get use to do with less do not have inflation because the people be live too well have inflation because the government be live too well and the last statement just a|few|days|ago be a speech to the effect that have inflation because government revenue have not keep pace with government spending see time be run out here will have to get this down very fast yes can lick inflation by increase productivity and by decrease the cost of government to the place that have balance budget and be no longer grind out print press money flood the market with because the government be spend more than take in and economic plan call for that the president 's economic plan call for increase the taxis to the point that finally take so much money away from the people that can balance the budget in that way but will have a very poor nation and a very unsound economy if follow that path mr smith a followup mr. ellis mr ellis yes have center on cut government spending in what have just say about own policy have also say that would increase defense spending specifically where would cut government spending if be to increase defense spending and also cut taxis so that presumably federal revenue would shrink governor reagan well most people when think about cut government spending think in term of eliminate necessary program or wipe out something some service that government be suppose to perform believe that there be enough extravagance and fat in government as a matter of fact of the secretaries of hew under mr. carter testify that think there be worth of fraud and waste in welfare and in the medical program associate with have have the|general|accounting|office estimate that there be probably tens|of|billions|of|dollar that be lose in fraud alone and have add that waste add even more to that have a program for a gradual reduction of government spending base on these theory and have a task force now that have be work on where those cut could be make be confident that can be do and that will reduce inflation because do in california and inflation go down below the national average in california when return money to the people and reduce government spending mr smith president carter the president governor reagan 's proposal the reagan kemp roth proposal be of the most highly inflationary idea that ever have be present to the american public would actually have to cut government spending by at|least|$130|billion in order to balance the budget under this ridiculous proposal notice that task force that be work for future plan have some of idea reveal in the|wall|street|journal this|week of those idea be to repeal the minimum wage and several time this|year governor reagan have say that the major cause of unemployment be the minimum wage this be a heartless kind of approach to the work family of country which be typical of many republican leader in the past but think have be accentuate under governor reagan in california be surprised governor reagan bring this up have the large tax increase in the history of that state under administration more than double state spending while be governor â€” increase and have between a 20- and 30-percent increase in the number of employee mr smith sorry to interrupt the president in california mr smith mr. carter the president thank sir mr smith governor reagan have the last word on this question governor reagan yes the figure that the president have just use about california be a distortion of the situation there because while be governor of california spending in california increase less per capita than the spending in georgia while mr. carter be governor of georgia in the|same|4|years the size of government increase only onesixth in california of what increase in proportion to population in georgia and the idea that tax cut proposal be inflationary would like to ask the president why be inflationary to let the people keep more of money and spend the way would like and be not inflationary to let take that money and spend the way want mr smith wish that question nee not be rhetorical but must be because have run out of time on that now the third question to governor reagan from william|hilliard urban policy mr hilliard yes governor reagan the decline of city have be hasten by the continual rise in crime strained race relation the fall in the quality of public education the persistence of abnormal poverty in a rich nation and a decline in the service to the public the sign seem to point toward a deterioration that could lead to the establishment of a permanent underclass in the city what specifically would do in the|next|4|years to reverse this trend governor reagan have be talk to a number of congressman who have much the same idea that have and that be that in the inner city area that in cooperation with local government and with national|government and use tax incentive and with cooperation with the private sector that have development zone let the local entity the city declare this particular area base on the standard of the percentage of people on welfare unemployed and so forth in that area and then through tax incentive induce the creation of business provide job and so forth in those area the element of government through these tax incentive for example a business that would not have for a period of time an increase in the property tax reflect development of the unused property that be make would not be any loss to the city because the city be not get any tax from that now and there would simply be a delay and on the other hand many of the people that would then be give job be presently ward of the government and would not hurt to give a tax incentive because that would not be cost government anything either think there be thing to do in this regard stand in the|south|bronx on the exact spot that president carter stand on in have to see to believe look like a bomb out city great gaunt skeleton of building window smash out paint on of unkept promise on another despair and this be the spot at which president carter have promise that be go to bring in a vast program to rebuild this area there be whole block of land that be leave bare just bulldoze down flat and nothing have be do and be now charge to take tourist through there to see this terrible desolation talk to a man just briefly there who ask simple question do have reason to hope that can someday take care of family again nothing have be do mr smith follow up mr. hilliard mr hilliard yes governor reagan black and other nonwhite be increase in number in city many of feel that be face a hostility from white that prevent from join the economic mainstream of society there be racial confrontation in the school on job and in housing as nonwhite seek to reap the benefit of a free society what do think be the nation 's future as a multiracial society governor reagan believe in be eternally optimistic and happen to believe that have make great progress from the|days when be young and when this country do not even know have a racial problem know those thing can grow out of despair in an inner city when there be hopelessness at home lack of work and so forth but believe that all of together and believe the presidency be what teddy|roosevelt say be be a bully pulpit and think that something can be do from there because the goal for all of should be that thing will be do neither because of nor in spite of any of the difference between ethnic difference or racial difference whatever may be that will have total equal opportunity for all people and would do everything could in power to bring that about mr smith mr. hilliard would repeat question for president carter mr hilliard president carter the decline of city have be hasten by the continual rise in crime strained race relation the fall in the quality of public education the persistence of abnormal poverty in a rich nation and a decline in service to the public the sign seem to point toward a deterioration that could lead to the establishment of a permanent underclass in the city what specifically would do in the|next|4|years to reverse this trend the president thank mr. hilliard when be campaign in everywhere go the mayor and local official be in despair about the rapidly deteriorate central city of nation initiate a very fine urban renewal program work with the mayor the governors and other interested official this have be a very successful effort that be of the main reason that have have such an increase in the number of people employ of the people put to work in new job since have be in office of those have be among black americans and another|million among those who speak spanish now be plan to continue the revitalization program with increase commitment of rapid transit mass transit under the windfall profit tax expect to spend about|$43|billion in the|next|10|year to rebuild the transportation system of country also be pursue housing program have have a 73-percent increase in the allotment of federal fund for improved education these be the kind of effort work on a joint basis with community leader particularly in the minority area of the central city that have be deteriorate so rapidly in the past be very important to that this be do with the full involvement of minority citizen have bring into the top level of government into the|white|house into administrative office of the executive branch into the judicial system highly qualified black and spanish citizen and woman who in the past have be exclude notice that governor reagan say that when be a young man that there be no knowledge of a racial problem in this country those who suffer from discrimination because of race or sex certainly know have a racial problem have go a long way toward correct these problem but still have a long way to go mr smith a followup question mr hilliard yes president carter would like to repeat the same followup to black and other nonwhite be increase in number in city many of feel that be face a hostility from white that prevent from join the economic mainstream of society there be racial confrontation in the school on job and in housing as nonwhite seek to reap the benefit of a free society what be assessment of the nation 's future in a multiracial society the president be a nation of refugee a nation of immigrant almost all of citizen come here from other land and now have hope which be be realize for a well life preserve ethnic commitment family structure religious belief preserve relationship with relative in foreign country but still form together in a very coherent society which give nation strength in the past those minority group have often be exclude from participation in the affair of government since have be president have appoint for instance more than twice as many black federal judge as all previous president in the history of this country have do the same thing in the appointment of woman and also spanish speak americans to involve in administration of government and a feeling that belong to the societal structure that make decision in the judiciary and in executive branch be a very important commitment which be try to realize and will continue to do so in the future mr smith governor reagan have a minute for rebuttal governor reagan yes the president talk of government program and have place but as governor when be at that end of the line and receive some of these grant for government program see that so many of be dead end be public employment for these people who really want to get out into the private job market where there be job with a future now the president speak a moment ago about that be against the minimum wage wish could have be with when sit with a group of teenager who be black and who be tell about unemployment problem and that be the minimum wage that have do away with the job that once could get and indeed every time have increase will find there be an increase in minority unemployment among young people and therefore have be in favor of a separate minimum for with regard to the great progress that have be make with this government spending the rate of black unemployment in detroit michigan be mr smith president garter have the last word on this question the president well be obvious that still have a long way to go in fully incorporate the minority group into the mainstream of american life have make good progress and there be no doubt in mind that the commitment to unemployment compensation the minimum wage welfare national health insurance those kind of commitment that have typify since ancient history in this country 's political life be a very important element of the future in all those element governor reagan have repeatedly speak out against which to show a very great insensitivity to give deprive family a well chance in life this to be a very important difference between and in this election and believe the american people will judge accordingly there be no doubt in mind that in the downtown central city with the new commitment on an energy policy with a chance to revitalize home and to make more fuel efficient with a chance for a synthetic fuel program solar power this will give an additional opportunity for job which will pay rich dividend mr smith thank gentleman now for the fourth question to president garter from barbara|walters international terrorism ms walters mr. president the eye of the country tonight be on the hostage in iran realize this be a sensitive area but the question of how respond to act of terrorism go beyond this current crisis other country have policy that determine how will respond israel for example consider hostage like soldier and will not negotiate with terrorist for the future mr. president the country have the right to know do have a policy for deal with terrorism wherever may happen and what have learn from this experience in iran that may cause to do thing differently if this or something similar happen again the president barbara of the blight on this world be the threat and the activity of terrorist at of the recent economic summit conference between and the other leader of the stern world commit to take strong action against terrorism airplane hijacking be of the element of that commitment there be no doubt that have see in recent|years in recent|months additional act of violence against jews in france and of course against those who live in israel by the plo and other terrorist organization ultimately the most serious terrorist threat be if of those radical nation who believe in terrorism as a policy should have atomic weapon both and all predecessor have have a deep commitment to control the proliferation of nuclear weapon in country like libya or iraq have even alienate some of close trade partner because have insist upon the control of the spread of nuclear weapon to those potentially terrorist country when governor reagan have be ask about that make a very disturbing comment that nonproliferation or the control of the spread of nuclear weapon be none of business and when be ask specifically recently about iraq say there be nothing can do about this ultimate terrorist threat be the most fearsome of all and be part of a pattern where country must stand firm to control terrorism of all kind mr smith ms. walters a followup ms walter yes while be discuss policy have iran not take american hostage assume that in order to preserve neutrality would have stop the flow of spare part and vital war materiel once war break out between iraq and iran now be offer to lift the ban on such good if let people come home do not this reward terrorism compromise neutrality and possibly antagonize nation now friendly to in the|middle|east the president will maintain position of neutrality in the iran and iraq war have no plan to sell additional materiel or good to iran that may be of a warlike nature when make decision to stop all trade with iran as a result of the taking of hostage announce then and have consistently maintain since then that if the hostage be release safely that would make delivery on those item which iran own which have buy and pay for also that the frozen iranian asset would be release that be be a consistent policy one intend to carry out mr smith would repeat the question now for governor reagan please ms. walters ms. walters yes governor the eye of the country tonight remain on the hostage in iran but the question of how respond to act of terrorism go beyond this current crisis there be other country that have policy that determine how will respond israel for example consider hostage like soldier and will not negotiate with terrorist for the future the country have the right to know do have a policy for deal with terrorism wherever may happen and what have learn from this experience in iran that may cause to do thing differently if this or something similar should happen again governor reagan well barbara have ask that question twice think ought to have answer to have be accuse lately of have a secret plan with regard to the hostage now this come from an answer that have make at|least|50 time during this campaign to the press the question would be have any idea of what would do if be there and say well yes and think that anyone that be seek this position as well as other people probably have think to what about this what about that these be just idea of what would think of if be in that position and have access to the information in which would know all the option that be open to have never answer the question however second the one that say well tell what be some of those idea first of all would be fearful that may say something that be presently under way or in negotiation and thus expose and endanger the hostage and sometimes think some of idea may involve quiet diplomacy where do not say in advance or say to anyone what be be think of do question be difficult to answer because in the situation right now no one want to say anything that would inadvertently delay in any way the return of those hostage if there be a chance of come home soon or that may cause harm what do think should be do once be safely here with family and that tragedy be over and have endure this humiliation for just lack 1|week|of|a|year now â€” then think be time for to have a complete investigation as to the diplomatic effort that be make in the beginning why have be there so long and when come home what do have to do in order to bring that about what arrangement be make and would suggest that congress should hold such an investigation in the meantime be go to continue pray that will come home mr smith follow up question ms. walters well would like to say that neither candidate answer specifically the question of a specific policy for deal with terrorism but will ask governor reagan a different followup question have suggest that there would be no iranian crisis have be president because would have give firm support to the shah but iran be a country of people who be resist a government regard as dictatorial question be not whether the shah 's regime be preferable to the ayatollah 's but whether the|united|state have the power or the right to try to determine what form of government any country will have and do back unpopular regime whose major merit be that be friendly to governor reagan the degree of unpopularity of a regime when the choice be total authoritarianism totalitarianism should say in the alternative government make wonder whether be be helpful to the people and have be guilty of that because someone do not meet exactly standard of human right even though be an ally of instead of try patiently to persuade to change way have in a number of instance aid a revolutionary overthrow which result in complete totalitarianism instead for those people and think that this be a kind of a hypocritical policy when at the same time be maintain a detente with the nation in the world where there be no human right at all â€” the|soviet|union now there be a second phase in the iranian affair in which have something to do with that and that be have adequate warning that there be a threat to embassy and could have do what other embassies do either strengthen security there or remove personnel before the kidnap and the takeover take place mr smith governor be sorry must interrupt president carter have a|minute for rebuttal the president do not hear any comment from governor reagan about what would do to stop or to reduce terrorism in the future what the western ally do decide to do be to stop all air flight commercial air flight to any nation involve in terrorism or the hijacking of airplane or the harboring of hijacker secondly all commit as have all predecessor in the|oval|office not to permit the spread of nuclear weapon to a terrorist nation or to any other nation that do not presently have those weapon or capability for explosive third not to make any sale of materiel or weapon to a nation which be involve in terrorist activity and lastly not to deal with the plo until and unless the plo recognize israel 's right to exist and recognize u.n.|resolution|242 as a basis for a middle|east peace these be a few of the thing to which nation be commit and will continue with these commitment mr smith governor reagan have the last word on that question governor reagan yes have no quarrel whatsoever with the thing that have be do because believe be high time that the civilized country of the world make plain that there be no room worldwide for terrorism there will be no negotiation with terrorist of any kind and while have a last word here would like to correct a misstatement of fact by the president have never make the statement that suggest about nuclear proliferation and nuclear proliferation or the try to halt would be a major part of a foreign policy of mr. smith thank gentleman that is of the debate now the rule for quite simple be only complicated when explain in the panelist with will have no followup question instead after the panelist have ask a question the candidate have answer each of the candidate will have opportunity to follow up to question to rebut or just to comment on opponent 's statement governor reagan will respond in this section to the first question from marvin|stone strategic arms limitation mr. stone governor reagan arm control the president say be the single most important issue both of have express the desire to end the nuclear arm race with russia but by method that be vastly different suggest that scrap treaty already negotiate and intensify the buildup of american power to induce the soviets to sign a new treaty more favorable to governor reagan yes mr stone president carter on the other hand say will again try to convince a reluctant congress to ratify the present treaty on the ground be the good can hope to get now both of can not be right will tell why think be governor reagan yes think be right because believe that must have a consistent foreign policy a strong america and a strong economy and then as build up national security to restore margin of safety at the same time try to restrain the soviet buildup which have be go forward at a rapid pace and for quite some time the salt ii treaty be the result of negotiation that mr. carter 's team enter into after have ask the|soviet|union for a discussion of actual reduction of nuclear strategic weapon and emissary think come home in have hear a very definite yet but take that one no from the|soviet|union then go back into negotiation on term because mr. carter have cancel the b-1 bomber delay the mx delay the trident submarine delay the cruise missile shut down the minuteman missile production line and whatever other thing that may have be do the|soviet|union sit at the table know that have go forward with unilateral concession without any reciprocation from whatsoever now have not block the salt ii treaty as mr. carter and mr. mondale suggest that have have be block by a senate in which there be a democratic majority indeed the|senate|armed|services|committee vote to with abstention against treaty and declare that be not in the national security interest of the|united|state besides which be illegal because the law of the land pass by congress say can not accept a treaty in which be not equal and be not equal in this treaty for reason alone b-52 bomber be consider to be strategic weapon backfire bomber be not mr smith governor have to interrupt at that point the time be up for that but the same question now to president carter mr stone yes president carter both of have express the desire to end the nuclear arm race with russia but through vastly different method the governor suggest scrap treaty which sign in vienna â€” intensify the buildup of american power to induce the soviets to sign a new treaty more favorable to on the other hand say will again try to convince a reluctant congress to ratify the present treaty on the ground be the good can hope to get from the russians can not both be right will tell why think be the president yes would be glad to inflation unemployment the city all very important issue but pale into insignificance in the life and duty of a president when compare with the control of nuclear weapon every president who have serve in the|oval|office since harry|truman have be dedicate to the proposition of control nuclear weapon to negotiate with the|soviet|union balance control observable and then reduce level of atomic weaponry there be a disturbing pattern in the attitude of governor reagan have never support any of those arm control agreement the limited test ban salt nor the antiballistic missile treaty nor the|vladivostok|treaty negotiate with the|soviet|union by president ford â€” and now want to throw into the wastebasket a treaty to control nuclear weapon on a balanced and equal basis between and the|soviet|union negotiate over a period by and republican predecessor the senate have not vote yet on the strategic arm limitation treaty there have be preliminary skirmishing in the committee of the senate but the treaty have never come to the floor of the senate for either a debate or a vote be understandable that a senator in the preliminary debate can make an irresponsible statement or maybe an ill advise statement have get other senator to correct that mistake if be a mistake but when a man who hope to be president say take this treaty discard do not vote do not debate do not explore the issue do not finally capitalize on this long negotiation that be a very dangerous and disturbing thing mr smith governor reagan have an opportunity to rebut that governor reagan yes would like to respond very much first of all the|soviet|union if have be critical of some of the previous agreement be because have be outnegotiate for quite a long time and have manage in spite of all of attempt at arm limitation to go forward with the big military buildup in the history of man now to suggest that because republican presidents try to pass the salt treaty that put on side â€” would like to say that president ford who be within of a treaty that could be in agreement with when leave office be emphatically against this salt treaty would like to point out also that senator like henry|jackson and holling of south|carolina â€” be take the lead in the fight against this particular treaty be not talk of scrap be talk of take the treaty back and go back into negotiation and would say to the|soviet|union will sit and negotiate with as long as take to have not only legitimate arm limitation but to have a reduction of these nuclear weapon to the point that neither of represent a threat to the other that be hardly throw away a treaty and be oppose to arm limitation mr smith president carter the president yes governor reagan be make some very misleading and disturbing statement not only advocate the scrapping of this treaty and do not know that these man that quote be against the treaty in final form but also advocate the possibility say be be a miss element of play a trump card against the|soviet|union of a nuclear arm race and insist upon nuclear superiority by own nation as a predication for negotiation in the future with the|soviet|union if president brezhnev say will scrap this treaty negotiate under american president over a period of time insist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiation and believe that the launching of a nuclear arm race be a good basis for future negotiation be obvious that as president and all americans would reject such a proposition this would mean the resumption of a very dangerous nuclear arm race would be very disturbing to american people would change the basic tone and commitment that nation have experience ever since with all president democratic and republican and would also be very disturbing to ally all of whom support this nuclear arm treaty in addition to that the adversarial relationship between and the|soviet|union would undoubtedly deteriorate very rapidly this attitude be extremely dangerous and belligerent in tone although be say with a quiet voice mr smith governor reagan governor reagan know the president 's suppose to be reply to but sometimes have a hard time in connect what be say with what have say or what position be sometimes think be like the witch doctor that get mad when a good doctor come along with a cure that will work point have make already mr. president with regard to negotiating do not call for nuclear superiority on the part of the|united|state call for a mutual reduction of these weapon as say that neither of can represent a threat to the other and to suggest that the salt ii treaty that negotiator negotiate be just a continuation and base on all of the precede effort by previous president be just not true be a new negotiation because as say president ford be within about|10|percent of have a solution that could be acceptable and think ally would be very happy to go along with a fair and verifiable salt agreement mr smith president carter have the last word on this question the president think to close out this discussion would be well to put into perspective what be talk about have a discussion with daughter amy the|other|day before come here to ask what the most important issue be say think nuclear weaponry and the control of nuclear arm this be a formidable force some of these weapon have megaton of explosion if put of tnt in each of railroad car would have a trainload of tnt stretch across this nation that be major war explosion in a warhead have thousand equivalent of megaton or million|ton of tnt warhead the control of these weapon be the single major responsibility of a president and to cast out this commitment of all president because of some slight technicality that can be correct be a very dangerous approach mr smith have to go to another question now from harry|ellis to president carter energy mr ellis mr. president as have say americans through conservation be import much less oil today than be even a|year|ago yet u.s. dependence on arab oil as a percentage of total import be today much high than be at the time of the arab oil embargo and for some time to come the loss of substantial amount of arab oil could plunge the u.s. into depression now this mean that a bridge must be build out of this dependence can the|united|state develop synthetic fuel and other alternative energy source without damage to the environment and will this process mean steadily high fuel bill for american family the president do not think there be any doubt that in the future the cost of oil be go to go up what have have as a basic commitment since have be president be to reduce dependence on foreign oil can only be do in way to conserve energy to stop the waste of energy and secondly to produce more american energy have be very successful in both case have now reduce the importing of foreign oil in the|last|year alone by onethird import today of oil less than do the same day just a|year|ago this commitment have be open up a very bright vista for nation in the future because with the windfall profit tax as a base now have an opportunity to use american technology and american ability and american natural resource to expand rapidly the production of synthetic fuel yes to expand rapidly the production of solar energy yes and also to produce the conventional kind of american energy will drill more oil and gas well this|year than any year in history will produce more coal this|year than any year in history be export more coal this|year than any year in history and have an opportunity now with improve transportation system and improve loading facility in port to see a very good opportunity on the world international market to replace opec oil with american coal as a basic energy source this exciting future will not only give more energy security but will also open up vast opportunity for americans to live a well life and to have million of new job associate with this new and very dynamic industry now in prospect because of the new energy policy that have put into effect mr smith would repeat the question now for governor reagan mr ellis governor reagan americans through conservation be import much less oil today than be even a|year|ago and yet u.s. reliance on arab oil as a percentage of total import be much high today than be during the arab oil embargo and the substantial loss of arab oil could plunge the|united|state into depression the question be whether the development of alternative energy source in order to reduce this dependence can be do without damage the environment and will mean for american family steadily high fuel bill governor reagan be not sure that mean steadily high fuel cost but do believe that this nation have be portray for too long a time to the people as be energy poor when be energy rich the coal that the president mention yes have and yet eighth of total coal resource be not be utilize at all right now the mine be close down there be miner out of work most of this be due to regulation which either interfere with the mining of or prevent the burning of with modern technology yes can burn coal within the limit of the|clean|air|act think as technology improve will be able to do even better with that the other thing be that have only lease out and begin to explore|2|percent of outer|continental|shelf for oil where be believe by everyone familiar with that fuel and that source of energy that there be vast supply yet to be find government have in the|last|year|or|so take out of multiple use millions|of|acre of public land that once be well be public land subject to multiple use exploration for mineral and so forth be believe that probably of the potential oil in the|united|state be probably hide in those land and no one be allow to even go and explore to find out if be there this be particularly true of the recent effort to shut down part of alaska nuclear power there be powerplant plan in this country and let add the word safety must be do with the utmost of safety but of those have give up and cancel plan to build and again because government regulation and permit and so forth make take more than twice as long to build a nuclear plant in the|united|state as do to build in japan or in western|europe have the source here be energy rich and coal be of the great potential have mr smith president carter comment the president yes sir to repeat have this|year the opportunity which will realize to produce of coal an unequaled record in the history of country governor reagan say that this be not a good achievement and blame restraint on coal production on regulation regulation that affect the life and the health and safety of miner and also regulation that protect the purity of air and the quality of water and land can not cast aside those regulation have a chance in the|next|15|year insist upon the health and safety of worker in the mine and also preserve the same high air and water pollution standard to triple the amount of coal produce governor reagan 's approach to energy policy which have already prove effectiveness be to repeal or to change substantially the windfall profit tax to return a major portion of back to the oil company to do away with the|department|of|energy to shortcircuit synthetic fuel program to put a minimal emphasis on solar power to emphasize strongly nuclear powerplant as a major source of energy in the future want to put all egg in basket and give that basket to the major oil company mr smith governor reagan governor reagan that be a misstatement of course of position just happen to believe that free enterprise can do a well job of produce the thing that people need than government can the|department|of|energy have a multibillion dollar budget in excess of have not produce a quart of oil or a lump of coal or anything else in the line of energy and for mr. carter to suggest that want to do away with the safety law and with the law that pertain to clean water and clean air and so forth as governor of california take charge of pass the strict air pollution law in the|united|state the strict air quality law that have ever be adopt in the|united|state and create an osha an occupational safety and health agency for the protection of employee before the|federal|government have in place and to this|day not of decision or ruling have ever be challenge so think some of those charge be miss the point be suggest that there be literally thousand of unnecessary regulation that invade every facet of business and indeed very much of personal life that be unnecessary that government can do without that have add to the cost of production in this country and that be contribute part to inflation and would like to see a little more free as once be mr smith president carter another crack at that the president sure as a matter of fact the air pollution standard law that be pass in california be pass over the objection of governor reagan and this be a very well know fact also recently when someone suggest that the|occupational|safety|and|health|act should be abolish governor reagan respond amen the offshore drilling right be a question that governor reagan raise often as a matter of fact in the proposal for the alaska land legislation of all the offshore land would be open for exploration and of all the alaska land where be suspect or believe that mineral may exist have with plan for the leasing of offshore land propose more land to be drill than have be open up for drilling since this program first start in so be not put restraint on american exploration be encourage in every way can mr smith governor reagan have the last word on this question governor reagan yes if be a wellknown fact that oppose air pollution law in california the only thing can possibly think of be that the president must be suggest the law that the|federal|government try to impose on the state of california â€” not a law regulation that would have make impossible to drive an automobile within the city limit of any california city or have a place to put if do drive against regulation would have destroy the economy of california and must say have the support of congress when point out how ridiculous this attempt be by the|environmental|protection|agency still have the strict air control or air pollution law in the country as for offshore oiling only|2|percent now be so lease and be produce oil the rest as to whether the land be go to be open in the|next|5|years or so â€” be already behind in what should be do there be more oil now in the well that have be drill than have be take out in the|121|year that have be drill mr smith thank governor thank mr. president the next question go to governor reagan from william|hilliard social security mr hilliard governor reagan wage earner in this country especially the young â€” be support a social security system that continue to affect income drastically the system be foster a struggle between the young and the old and be drift the country toward a polarization of these group how much longer can the young wage earner expect to bear the ever increase burden of the social security system governor reagan the social security system be base on a false premise with regard to how fast the number of worker would increase and how fast the number of retiree would increase be actuarially out of balance and this first become evident about|16|years|ago and some of be voice warning then now be trillions|of|dollar out of balance and the only answer that have come so far be the big single tax increase in nation 's history the payroll tax increase for social security which will only put a band aid on this and postpone of reckon by a|few|year at most what be need be a study that have propose by a task force of expert to look into this entire problem as to how can be reform and make actuarially sound but with the premise that no one presently dependent on social security be go to have the rug pull out from under and not get check can not frighten as have with the threat and the campaign rhetoric that have go on in this campaign senior citizen leave think that in some way be endanger and would have no place to turn must continue to get those check and believe that the system can be put on a sound actuarial basis but be go to take some study and some work and not just pass a tax increase to let the roof fall in on the next administration mr smith would repeat that question for president carter mr hilliard yes president carter wage earner in this country especially the young be support a social security system that continue to affect income drastically the system be foster a struggle between young and old and be drift the country toward a polarization of these group how much longer can the young wage earner expect to bear the ever increase burden of the social security system the president as long as there be a democratic president in the|white|house will have a strong and viable social security system free of the threat of bankruptcy although governor reagan have change position lately on different occasion have advocate make social security a voluntary system which would in effect very quickly bankrupt notice also in the|wall|street|journal earlier|this|week that a preliminary report of task force advocate make social security more sound by reduce the adjustment in social security for the retire people to compensate for the impact of inflation these kind of approach be very dangerous to the security and the well being and the peace of mind of the retired people of this country and those approach retirement age but no matter what take in the future to keep social security sound must be keep that way and although there be a serious threat to the social security system and integrity during the campaign and when become president the action of the|democratic|congress work with have be to put social security back on a sound financial basis that be the way will stay mr smith governor reagan governor reagan well that just be not true have as say delay the actuarial imbalance fall on for just|a|few|year with that increase in taxis and do not believe can go on increase the tax because the problem for the young people today be that be pay in far more than can ever expect to get out now again this statement that somehow want to destroy and just change tune that be for voluntary social security which would mean the ruin of mr. president the voluntary thing that suggest be that a young man orphan and raise by an aunt who die aunt be ineligible for social security insurance because be not mother and suggest that if this be an insurance program certainly the person who be pay in should be able to name own beneficiary and that be the close have ever come to anything voluntary with social security too be pledge to a social security program that will reassure these senior citizen of our be go to continue to get money be some change would like to make would like to make a change that discriminate in the regulation against a wife who work and find that then be face with a choice between husband 's benefit if die first or what have pay in but do not recognize that have also be pay in and be entitle to more than presently can get would like to change that mr smith president carter 's rebuttal now the president fine these constant suggestion that the basic social security system should be change do cause concern and consternation among the aged of country be obvious that should have a commitment to that social security benefit should not be tax and that there would be no peremptory change in the standard by which social security payment be make to the retired people also need to continue to index the social security payment so that if inflation rise the social security payment would rise a commensurate degree to let the buying power of the social security check continue intact in the past the relationship between social security and medicare have be very important to provide some modicum of aid for senior citizen in the retention of health benefit governor reagan as a matter of fact begin political career campaign around this nation against medicare now have an opportunity to move toward national health insurance with an emphasis on the prevention of disease an emphasis on outpatient care not inpatient care an emphasis on hospital cost containment to hold down the cost of hospital care for those who be ill an emphasis on catastrophic health insurance so that if a family be threaten with be wipe out economically because of a very high medical bill then the insurance would help pay for these be the kind of element of a national health insurance important to the american people governor reagan again typically be against such a proposal mr smith governor governor reagan there go again laughter when oppose medicare there be another piece of legislation meet the same problem before the congress happen to favor the other piece of legislation and think that would be well for the senior citizen and provide well care than the one that be finally pass be not oppose the principle of provide care for be oppose piece of legislation as versus another there be something else about social security of course that do not come out of the payroll tax come out of the general fund that something should be do about think be disgraceful that the|disability|insurance|fund in social security find check go every month to tens|of|thousand of people who be lock up in institution for crime or for mental illness and be receive disability check from social security every|month while a state institution provide for all of need and care mr smith president carter have the last word on this question the president think this debate on social security medicare national health insurance typify as vividly as any other subject tonight the basic historical difference between and the allusion to basic change in the minimum wage be another and the deleterious comment that governor reagan have make about unemployment compensation these commitment that the|democratic|party have historically make to the work family of this nation have be extremely important to the growth in stature and in a well quality of life for notice recently that governor reagan frequently quote democratic president in acceptance address and otherwise have never hear a candidate for president who be a republican quote a republican president but when get in office try to govern like republicans so good for the american people to remember there be a sharp basic historical difference between governor reagan and on these crucial issue also between the party that represent mr smith thank mr. president governor reagan now go to another question a question to president carter by barbara|walters assessments of opponent ms walter thank have address some of the major issue tonight but the big issue in the mind of american voter be yourself ability to lead this country when many voter go into that booth from today will be vote gut instinct about man have already give reason why people should vote for now would please tell for this final question why should not vote for opponent why presidency could be harmful to the nation and have examine both opponent 's record and the man tell great weakness the president barbara reluctant as be to say anything critical about governor reagan will try to answer question laughter first of all there be the historical perspective that just describe this be a contest between a democrat in the mainstream of party as exemplify by the action that have take in the oval office the|last|4|years as contrast with governor reagan who in most case do typify party but in some case there be a radical departure by from the heritage of eisenhower and other the most important crucial difference in this election campaign in judgment be the approach to the control of nuclear weaponry and the inclination to control or not to control the spread of atomic weapon to other nation that do not presently have particularly the terrorist nation the inclination that governor reagan have exemplify in many troubled time since be be run for president â€” think since to inject american military force in place like north|korea to put a blockade around cuba this|year or in some instance to project american force into a fishing dispute against the small nation of ecuador on the west coast of this be typical of longstanding inclination on the use of american power not to resolve dispute diplomatically and peacefully but to show that the exercise of military power be best prove by the actual use of obviously no president want war and certainly do not believe that governor reagan if be president would want war but a president in the|oval|office have to make a judgment on almost a daily basis about how to exercise the enormous power of country for peace through diplomacy or in a careless way in a belligerent attitude which have exemplify attitude in the past mr smith barbara would repeat the question for governor reagan ms walter yes thank realize that may be equally reluctant to speak ill of opponent may ask why people should not vote for opponent why presidency could be harmful to the nation and have examine both opponent 's record and the man could tell great weakness governor reagan well barbara believe that there be a fundamental difference and think have be evident in most of the answer that mr. carter have give tonight that seek the solution to anything as another opportunity for a federal|government program happen to believe that the|federal|government have usurped power and autonomy and authority that belong back at the state and local level have impose on the individual freedom of the people and that there be more of these thing that could be solve by the people if be give a chance or by the level of government that be close to now as to why should be and should not be when be a candidate in president carter invent a thing call the misery index add the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation and come at that time to under president ford and say that no man with that size misery index have a right to seek reelection to the presidency today by own decision the misery index be in excess of and think this must suggest something but when have quote a democrat president as the president say be a democrat say many foolish thing back in those|days laughter but the president that quote have make a promise a democrat promise and quote because be never keep and today would find that that promise be at the very heart of what republicanism represent in this country today and that be why believe there be go to be million of democrats that be go to vote with this time around because too want that promise keep be a promise for less government and less taxis and more freedom for the people mr smith president carter the president yes mention the radical departure of governor reagan from the principle or ideal or historical perspective of own party do not think this can be better illustrate than in the case with guarantee woman equal right under the|constitution|of|our|nation for platform call for guarantee woman equal right with a constitutional amendment predecessor of mine who serve in the|oval|office call for this guarantee of woman 's right governor reagan and the new republican|party have depart from this commitment a very severe blow to the opportunity for woman finally to correct discrimination under which have suffer when a man and a woman do the same amount of work a man get pay a dollar a woman only get pay and the equal right amendment only say that equality of right shall not be abridge for woman by the|federal|government or by the state government that be all say a simple guarantee of equality of opportunity which typify and which be a very important commitment of mine as contrast with governor reagan 's radical departure from the longstanding policy of own party mr smith governor reagan governor reagan yes mr. president once again happen to be against the amendment because think the amendment will take this problem out of the hand of elect legislator and put in the hand of unelected judge be for equal right and while have be in office for and not single state â€” and most of have a majority of democratic legislator have add to the ratification or vote to ratify the equal right amendment while be governor find separate instance where woman be discriminate against in the body of california law and have pass and sign into law statute that eliminate those discrimination include the economic one that have just mention equal pay and so forth believe that if in all|these|years that have spend try to get the amendment that would spend as much time correct these law as do in california â€” and be the first to do if be president would also now take a look at the hundred of federal regulation which discriminate against woman and which go right on while everyone be look for an amendment would have someone ride herd on those regulation and would start eliminate those discrimination in the|federal|government against woman mr smith president carter the president yes howard be a southerner and share the basic belief of region about an excessive government intrusion into the private affair of american citizen and also into the private affair of the free enterprise system of the commitment that make be to deregulate the major industry of this country have be remarkably successful with the help of the|democratic|congress have deregulate the air industry the rail industry the trucking industry financial institution now work on the communication industry in addition to that believe this element of discrimination be something that the south have see so vividly as a blight on region of the country which have now be correct â€” not only racial discrimination but discrimination against people that have to work for a living â€” because have be try to pick up by bootstrap since the long depression|year and lead a full and useful life in the affair of this country have make remarkable success be part of consciousness and of commitment to continue this progress so heritage as a southerner experience in the|oval|office convince that what have just describe be a proper course for the future mr smith governor reagan be the last word governor reagan well last word be again to say that be talk about this very simple amendment and woman 's right and make plain again be for woman 's right but would like to call the attention of the people to the fact that so call simple amendment could be use by mischievous man to destroy discrimination that properly belong by law to woman respect the physical difference between the sex labor law that protect against do thing that would be physically harmful to those could all be challenge by man and the same would be true with regard to combat service in the military and so forth think that be the subject be suppose to be on but if be talk about how much think about the work people and so forth be the only fellow that ever run for this job who be time president of own union and still have a lifetime membership in that union mr smith gentleman each of now have for a close statement president carter be first closing statement the president first of all would like to thank the|league|of|women|voter for make this debate possible think be be a very constructive debate and hope be help to acquaint the american people with the sharp difference between and governor reagan also want to thank the people of cleveland and ohio for be such hospitable host during this|last|few|hour in life have be president now for almost|4|year have have to make thousand of decision and each of those decision have be a learning process have see the strength of nation and have see the crisis that approach in a tentative way and have have to deal with those crisis as best could as have study the record between and governor reagan have be impress with the stark difference that exist between think the result of this debate indicate that that fact be true consider in the mainstream of party consider in the mainstream even of the bipartisan list of president who have serve before the|united|state must be a nation strong the|united|states must be a nation secure must have a society that be just and fair and must extend the benefit of own commitment to peace to create a peaceful world believe that since have be in office there have be or area of combat evolve in other part of the world in each case alone have have to determine the interest of country and the degree of involvement of country have do that with moderation with care with thoughtfulness sometimes consult expert but have learn in this|last|3|1/2|year that when an issue be extremely difficult when the call be very close the chance be the expert will be divide almost|50 and the final judgment about the future of nation war peace involvement reticence thoughtfulness care consideration concern have to be make by the man in the|oval|office be a lonely job but with the involvement of the american people in the process with an open government the job be a very gratifying the american people now be face next|tuesday a lonely decision those listen to voice will have to make a judgment about the future of this country and think ought to remember that vote can make a lot of difference if vote per precinct have change in john|kennedy would never have be president of this nation and if a few more people have go to the poll and vote in hubert|humphrey would have be president richard|nixon would not there be a partnership involve and nation to stay strong to stay at peace to raise high the banner of human right to set an example for the rest of the world to let deep belief and commitment be feel by other in all other nation be plan for the future ask the american people to join in this partnership mr smith governor reagan governor reagan yes would like to add word of thank too to the lady of the|league|of|women|voter for make these debate possible be sorry that could not persuade the bringing in of the third candidate so that could have be see also in these debate but still be good that at least once all of be hear by the people of this country next tuesday be election|day next|tuesday all of will go to the poll will stand there in the polling place and make a decision think when make that decision may be well if would ask be well off than be be easy for to go and buy thing in the store than be be there more or less unemployment in the country than there be be america as respect throughout the world as be do feel that security be as safe that be as strong as be and if answer all of those question yes why then think choice be very obvious as to who will vote for if do not agree if do not think that this course that have be on for the|last|4|years be what would like to see follow for the|next|4 then could suggest another choice that have this country do not have to be in the shape that be in do not have to go on sharing in scarcity with the country get bad off with unemployment grow talk about the unemployment line if all of the unemployed today be in a single line allow for each of that line would reach from new|york|city to los|angeles california all of this can be cure and all of can be solve have not have the experience the president have have in hold that office but think in be governor of california the most populous state in the union if be a nation would be the seventh rank economic power in the world too have some lonely moment and decision to make know that the economic program that have propose for this nation in the|next|few|year can resolve many of the problem that trouble today know because do there cut the cost the increase cost of government the increase in half over return in tax rebate credit and cut to people as have say earlier fall below the national average in inflation when do that and know that do give back authority and autonomy to the people would like to have a crusade today and would like to lead that crusade with help and would be to take government off the back of the great people of this country and turn loose again to do those thing that know can do so well because do and make this country great thank mr smith gentleman lady and gentleman for voters have be commit to citizen education and effective participation of americans in governmental and political affair the most critical element of all in that process be an informed citizen who go to the poll and who vote on

know this be such a time and can tell that the choice to be make this|year can transform own personal life and the life of country as well during the last presidential campaign crisscross this country and listen to thousands|and|thousand of people housewife and farmer teacher and small business leader worker and student the elderly and the poor people of every race and every background and every walk of life be a powerful experience a total immersion in the human reality of america and have now have another kind of total immersion be president of the|united|states|of|america let talk for a moment about what that job be like and what have learn from have learn that only the most complex and difficult task come before in the|oval|office no easy answer be find there because no easy question come there have learn that for a president experience be the good guide to the right decision be wise tonight than be and have learn that the presidency be a place of compassion own heart be burden for the troubled americans the poor and the jobless and the afflict become part of thought and prayer for hostage in iran be as though be own son and daughter the life of every human being on earth can depend on the experience and judgment and vigilance of the person in the|oval|office the president 's power for building and power for destruction be awesome and the power 's great exactly where the stake be high in matter of war and peace and have learn something else something that have come to see with extraordinary clarity above all must look ahead because the president of the|united|state be the steward of the nation 's destiny must protect child and the child will have and the child of generation to follow must speak and act for that be burden and glory and that be why a president can not yield to the shortsighted demand no matter how rich or powerful the special interest may be that make those demand and that be why the president can not bend to the passion of the moment however popular may be that be why the president must sometimes ask for sacrifice when listener would rather hear the promise of comfort the president be a servant of today but true constituency be the future that be why the election of be so important some have say make no difference who win this election be wrong this election be a stark choice between man party sharply different picture of what america be and what the world be but be more than that be a choice between future the year be just less than away just presidential election after this one child bear this|year will come of age in the|21st|century the time to shape the world of the|year|2000 be now the decision of the|next|few|year will set course perhaps an irreversible course and the most important of all choice will be make by the american people at the poll less|than|3|month from tonight the choice could not be more clear nor the consequence more crucial in of the future can choose the future that and have be build together see security and justice and peace see a future of economic security security that will come from tap own great resource of oil and gas coal and sunlight and from build the tool and technology and factory for a revitalize economy base on job and stable price for everyone see a future of justice the justice of good job decent health care quality education a full opportunity for all people regardless of color or language or religion the simple human justice of equal right for all man and for all woman guarantee equal right at last under and see a future of peace a peace bear of wisdom and base on a fairness toward all country of the world a peace guarantee both by american military strength and by american moral strength as well that be the future want for all people a future of confidence and hope and a good life be the future america must choose and with help and with commitment be the future america will choose but there be another possible future in that other future see despair despair of million who would struggle for equal opportunity and a well life and struggle alone and see surrender the surrender of energy future to the merchant of oil the surrender of economic future to a bizarre program of massive tax cut for the rich service cut for the poor and massive inflation for everyone and see risk the risk of international confrontation the risk of an uncontrollable unaffordable and unwinnable nuclear arm race no one democrat or republican either consciously seek such a future and do not claim that opponent do but do question the disturb commitment and policy already make by and by those with who have now capture control of the consequence of those commitment and policy would drive down the wrong road be up to all of to make sure america reject this alarming and even perilous destiny the only way to build a well future be to start with the reality of the present but while democrats grapple with the real challenge of a real world other talk about a world of tinsel and make believe let look for a moment at make believe world in fantasy america inner city people and farm worker and laborer do not exist woman like child be to be see but not hear the problem of work woman be simply ignore the elderly do not need medicare the young do not need more help in get a well education worker do not require the guarantee of a healthy and a safe place to work in fantasy world all the complex global change of the world since world|war|ii have never happen in fantasy america all problem have simple solution â€” simple and wrong be a make believe world a world of good guy and bad guy where some politician shoot first and ask question later no hard choice no sacrifice no tough decision sound too good to be true and be the path of fantasy lead to irresponsibility the path of reality lead to hope and peace the path could not be more different nor could the future to which lead let take a hard look at the consequence of choice and have be work toward a more secure future by rebuild military strength steadily carefully and responsibly the republicans talk about military strength but be in office for out of the|last|11|year and in the face of a grow soviet threat steadily cut real defense spending by more|than|a|third have reverse the republican decline in defense every year since have be president have have real increase in commitment to a strong nation increase which be prudent and rational there be no doubt that the|united|states|of|america can meet a threat from the|soviet|union modernized strategic force a revitalize nato the trident submarine the cruise missile the|rapid|deployment|force all these guarantee that will never be second to any nation deed not word fact not fiction must and will continue to build own defense must and will continue to seek balanced reduction in nuclear arm the new leader of in order to close the gap between rhetoric and record have now promise to launch an all out nuclear arm race this would negate any further effort to negotiate a strategic arm limitation agreement there can be no winner in such an arm race and all the people of the earth can be the loser the republican nominee advocate abandon arm control policy which have be important and support by every democratic president since harry truman and also by every republican president since dwight|d.|eisenhow this radical and irresponsible course would threaten security and could put the whole world in peril and must never let this come to pass be simple to call for a new arm race but when armed aggression threaten world peace tough sound talk like that be not enough a president must act responsibly when soviet troop invade afghanistan move quickly to take action suspend some grain sale to the|soviet|union call for draft registration and join wholeheartedly with the congress and with the|u.s.|olympic|committee and lead more|than|60 other nation in boycott the big propaganda show in russia â€” the|moscow|olympic the republican leader oppose of these forceful but peaceful action and waffle on the third but when ask what would do about aggression in southwest|asia suggest blockade cuba laughter even running mate would not go along with that do not seem to know what to do with the russians be not sure if want to feed or play with or fight with as look back at first term be grateful that have have a country for the|full|4|years of peace and that be what be go to have for the|next|4|years peace be only common sense that if america be to stay secure and at peace must encourage other to be peaceful as well as know have help in zimbabwe rhodesia where have stand firm for racial justice and democracy and have also help in the|middle|east some have criticize the camp david accord and have criticize some delay in the implementation of the middle|east peace treaty well before become president there be no camp david accord and there be no middle|east peace treaty before camp david israel and egypt be poise across barbed wire confront each other with gun and tank and plane but afterward talk face to face with each other across a peace table and also communicate through own ambassadors in cairo and tel|aviv now that be the kind of future be offer â€” of peace to the|middle|east if the democrats be reelect in the fall be very proud that nearly|half the aid that country have ever give to israel in the|32|year of existence have come during administration unlike republican predecessor have never stop nor slow that aid to israel and as long as be president will never do so commitment be clear security and peace for israel peace for all the people of the|middle|east but if the world be to have a future of freedom as well as peace america must continue to defend human right now listen to this the new republican leader oppose human right policy want to scrap seem to think be naive for america to stand up for freedom and democracy just what do think should stand up for ask the former political prisoner who now live in freedom if should abandon stand on human right ask the dissident in the|soviet|union about commitment to human right ask the|hungarian|american ask the|polish|american listen to pope john|paul|ii ask those who be suffer for the sake of justice and liberty around the world ask the million who have flee tyranny if america should stop speak out for human principle ask the american people tell that as long as be president will hold high the banner of human right and can depend on here at home the choice between the future be equally important in the long run nothing be more crucial to the future of america than energy nothing be so disastrously neglect in the past long after the arab oil embargo the republicans in the|white|house have still do nothing to meet the threat to the national security of nation then as now policy be dictate by the big oil company democrats fight hard to rally nation behind a comprehensive energy policy and a good program a new foundation for challenge and exciting progress now after of struggle have that program the battle to secure america 's energy future have be fully and finally join americans have cooperate with dramatic result have reverse decade of dangerous and grow dependence on foreign oil be now import less oil that be of oil every day less than the day take office and with new energy policy now in place can discover more produce more create more and conserve more energy and will use american resource american technology and million of american worker to do with now what do the republicans propose basically energy program have part the first part be to get rid of almost everything that have do for the american public in the|last|3|years want to reduce or abolish the synthetic fuel program want to slash the solar energy incentive the conservation program aid to mass transit aid to elderly americans to help pay fuel bill want to eliminate the 55-mile speed limit and while be at the republicans would like to gut the|clean|air|act never like to begin with that be part of program the other part be bad to replace what have build this be what propose to destroy the windfall profit tax and to unleash the oil company and let solve the energy problem for that be that be that be whole program there be no more can this nation accept such an outrageous program audience no the president no democrats will fight every step of the way and will begin tomorrow|morne with a campaign for reelection in november when take office inherit a heavy load of serious economic problem besides energy and have meet all head on have slash government regulation and put free enterprise back into the airline the trucking and the financial system of country and be now do the same thing for the railroad this be the great change in the relationship between government and business since the new deal have increase export dramatically have reverse the decline in the basic research and development and have create more|than|8|million new job the big increase in the history of country but the road be bumpy and last|year 's skyrocket opec price increase have help to trigger a worldwide inflation crisis take forceful action and interest rate have now fall the dollar be stable and although still have a battle on hand be struggle to bring inflation under control be now at the critical point a turning point in economic history of country but because make the hard decision because have guide nation and economy through a rough but essential period of transition have lay the groundwork for a new economic age economic renewal program for the 's will meet immediate need for job and attack the very same long range problem that cause unemployment and inflation in the first place will move america simultaneously towards great economic goal low inflation well productivity revitalization of american industry energy security and job be time to put all america back to work but not in make work in real work and there be real work in modernize american industry and create new industry for america as well here be just a few thing will rebuild together and build together â€”new industry to turn own coal and shale and farm product into fuel for car and truck and to turn the light of the sun into heat and electricity for home modern transportation system of railbed and port to make american coal into a powerful rival of opec oil â€”industrie that will provide the convenience of futuristic computer technology and communication to serve million of american home and office and factory â€”job training for worker displace by economic change â€”new investment pinpoint in region and community where job be need most â€”better mass transit in city and in between city â€”and a whole new generation of american job to make home and vehicle and building that will house and move in comfort with a lot less energy this be important too have no doubt that the ingenuity and dedication of the american people can make every single of these thing happen be talk about the|united|states|of|america and those who count this country out as an economic superpower be go to find out just how wrong be be go to share in the exciting enterprise of make the 's a time of growth for america the republican alternative be the big tax giveaway in history call reagan kemp roth call a free lunch that americans can not afford the republican tax program offer rebate to the rich deprivation for the poor and fierce inflation for all of party 's own vice presidential nominee say that reagan kemp roth would result in an inflation rate of more|than|30|percent call voodoo economic suddenly change mind toward the end of the|republican|convention but be right the first time along with this gigantic tax cut the new republican leader promise to protect retirement and health program and to have massive increase in defense spending and claim can balance the budget if be serious about these promise and say be then a close analysis show that the entire rest of the government would have to be abolish everything from education to farm program from the g.i. bill to the|night watchman at the|lincoln|memorial and budget would still be in the red the only alternative would be to build more printing press to print cheap money either way the american people lose but the american people will not stand for the|democratic|party have always embody the hope of people for justice opportunity and a well life and have work in every way possible to strengthen the american family to encourage self reliance and to follow admonition defend the poor and the fatherless give justice to the afflicted and needy have struggle to assure that no child in america ever go to bed hungry that no elderly couple in america have to live in a substandard home and that no young person in america be exclude from college because the family be poor but what have the republicans proposed?â€”just an attack on everything that have do in the achievement of social justice and decency that have win in the|last|50|year ever since franklin|delano|roosevelt 's first term would make social security voluntary would reverse progress on the minimum wage full employment law safety in the work place and a healthy environment lately as know the republicans have be quote democratic presidents but who can blame would rather quote herbert|hoover or franklin|delano|roosevelt would rather quote richard|nixon or john|fitzgerald|kennedy the republicans have always be the party of privilege but this|year leader have go even further in platform have repudiate the good tradition of own party where be the conscience of lincoln in the party of lincoln what be become of traditional republican commitment to fiscal responsibility what be happen to commitment to a safe and sane arm control now do not claim perfection for do not claim that every decision that have make have be right or popular certainly have not all be easy but will say this have be test under fire have neither duck nor hide and have tackle the great central issue of time the historic challenge of peace and energy which have be ignore for year have make tough decision and have take the heat for have make mistake and have learn from but have build the foundation now for a well future have do something else perhaps even more important in good time and bad in the valley and on the peak have tell people the truth the hard truth the truth that sometimes hurt truth that americans have learn be that dream have be earn for progress and for peace look what land have be through within own memory a great depression a world war a technological explosion the civil right revolution the bitterness of vietnam the shame of watergate the twilight peace of nuclear terror through each of these momentous experience have learn the hard way about the world and about but have mature and have grow as a nation and have grow strong have learn the us and the limitation of power have learn the beauty and responsibility of freedom have learn the value and the obligation of justice and have learn the necessity of peace some would argue that to master these lesson be somehow to limit potential that be not so a nation which know true strength which see true challenge which understand legitimate constraint that nation nation be far strong than which take refuge in wishful thinking or nostalgia the american people have understand these fundamental truth all of can sympathize with the desire for easy answer there be often the temptation to substitute idle dream for hard reality the new republican leader be hope that nation will succumb to that temptation this|year but profoundly misunderstand and underestimate the character of the american people after pearl|harbor winston|churchill come to north|america and say have not journey all this way across the century across the ocean across the mountain across the prairie because be make of sugar candy americans have courage americans have always be on the cutting edge of change have always look forward with anticipation and confidence still want the same thing that all of want a self reliant neighborhood strong family work for the able bodied and good medical care for

unique in world history because have a genius for leader many leader on many level but back in mr. carter say trust and a lot of people do now many of those people be out of work many have see saving eat away by inflation many other on fix income especially the elderly have watch helplessly as the cruel tax of inflation waste away purchasing power and today a great many who trust mr. carter wonder if can survive the carter policy of national defense trust government ask that concentrate hope and dream on man that trust to do what be good for view of government place trust not in person or party but in those value that transcend person and party the trust be where belong in the people the responsibility to live up to that trust be where belong in elect leader that kind of relationship between the people and elect leader be a special kind of compact three|hundred|and|sixty|years|ago in a group of family dare to cross a mighty ocean to build a future for in a new world when arrive at plymouth massachusetts form what call a compact an agreement among to build a community and abide by law the single act the voluntary bind together of free people to live under the law set the pattern for what be to come a century and a half later the descendant of those people pledge life fortune and sacred honor to find this nation some forfeit fortune and life none sacrifice honor score and seven|years|later abraham|lincoln call upon the people of all america to renew dedication and commitment to a government of for and by the people be not once again time to renew compact of freedom to pledge to each other all that be good in life all that give meaning to for the sake of this beloved and blessed land together let make this a new beginning let make a commitment to care for the needy to teach child the value and the virtue hand down to by family to have the courage to defend those value and the willingness to sacrifice for let pledge to restore in time the american spirit of

government the capacity to do the people 's work without dominate life pledge to a government that will not only work well but wisely ability to act temper by prudence and willingness to do good balance by the knowledge that government be never more dangerous than when desire to have help blind to great power to harm the first republican president once say while the people retain virtue and vigilance no administration by any extreme of wickedness or folly can seriously injure the government in the short space of four|year if mr. lincoln could see what be happen in these last and a half year may hedge a little on that statement but with the virtue that legacy as a free people and with the vigilance that sustain liberty still have time to use renew compact to overcome the injury that have be do to america these past and a half year first must overcome something the present administration have cook up a new and altogether indigestible economic stew part inflation part high unemployment part recession part runaway taxis party deficit spending and season by an energy crisis be an economic stew that have turn the national stomach our be not problem of abstract economic theory those be problem of flesh and blood problem that cause pain and destroy the moral fiber of real people who should not suffer the further indignity of be tell by the government that be all somehow fault do not have inflation because as mr. carter say have live too well the head of a government which have utterly refuse to live within mean and which have in the|last|few|day tell that this year 's deficit will be dare to point the finger of blame at business and labor both of which have be engage in a lose struggle just try to stay even high taxis be tell be somehow good for as if when government spend money be not inflationary but when spend be those who preside over the bad energy shortage in history tell to use less so that will run out of oil gasoline and natural gas a little more slowly conservation be desirable of course for must not waste energy but conservation be not the sole answer to energy need america must get to work produce more energy the republican program for solve economic problem be base on growth and productivity large amount of oil and natural gas lie beneath land and off shore untouched because the present administration seem to believe the american people would rather see more regulation taxis and control than more energy coal offer great potential so do nuclear energy produce under rigorous safety standard could supply electricity for thousand of industry and million of job and home must not be thwart by a tiny minority oppose to economic growth which often find friendly ear in regulatory agency for obstructionist campaign make no mistake will not permit the safety of people or environment heritage to be jeopardize but be go to reaffirm that the economic prosperity of people be a fundamental part of environment problem be both acute and chronic yet all hear from those in position of leadership be the same tired proposal for more government tinkering more meddling and more control all of which lead to this state in the first place can anyone look at the record of this administration and say well do can anyone compare the state of economy when the|carter|administration take office with where be today and say keep up the good work can anyone look at reduce standing in the world today and say let have four|more|year of this believe the american people be go to answer these question and answer will be no we've have enough and then will be up to begin next|january|20th to offer an administration and congressional leadership of competence and more than a little courage must have the clarity of vision to see the difference between what be essential and what be merely desirable and then the courage to bring government back under control and make acceptable to the people be essential that maintain both the forward momentum of economic growth and the strength of the safety net beneath those in society who need help also believe be essential that the integrity of all aspect of social|security be preserve beyond these essential believe be clear federal government be overgrow and overweight indeed be time for government to go on a diet therefore first act as chief executive will be to impose an immediate and thorough freeze on federal hiring then be go to enlist the very good mind from business labor and whatever|quarter to conduct a detailed review of every department bureau and agency that live by federal appropriation be also go to enlist the help and idea of many dedicated and hard work government employee at all level who want a more efficient government as much as the rest of do know that many be demoralize by the confusion and waste confront in work as a result of fail and fail policy instruction to the group enlist will be simple and direct will remind that government program exist at the sufferance of the american taxpayer and be pay for with money earn by work man and woman any program that represent a waste of money a theft from pocketbook must have that waste eliminate or the program must go by executive order where possible by congressional action where necessary everything that can be run more effectively by state and local government shall turn over to state and local government along with the funding source to pay for be go to put an end to the money merry go round where money become washington 's money to be spend by the state and city exactly the way the federal bureaucrat tell to will not accept the excuse that the federal government have grow so big and powerful that be beyond the control of any president any administration or congress be go to put an end to the notion that the american taxpayer exist to fund the federal government the federal government exist to serve the american people on january|20th be go to re - establish that truth also on that date be go to initiate action to get substantial relief for taxpaye citizen and action to put people back to work none of this will be base on any new form of monetary tinkering or fiscal sleight of hand will simply apply to government the common sense all use in daily life work and family be at the center of life the foundation of dignity as a free people when deprive people of what have earn or take away job destroy dignity and undermine family can not support family unless there be job and can not have job unless people have both money to invest and the faith to invest there be concept that stem from an economic system that for have help master a continent create a previously undreamed of prosperity for people and have feed million of other around the globe that system will continue to serve in the future if government will stop ignore the basic value on which be build and stop betray the trust and good will of the american worker who keep go the american people be carry the heavy peacetime tax burden in nation 's history and will grow even heavy under present law next|january be tax into economic exhaustion and stagnation crush ability and incentive to save invest and produce this must stop must halt this fiscal self destruction and restore sanity to economic system have long advocate a reduction in income tax rate over a period of three|years this phase tax reduction would begin with a down payment tax cut in which the republicans and congress and have already propose a phase reduction of tax rate would go a long way toward ease the heavy burden on the american people but should not stop here within the context of economic condition and appropriate budget priority during each|fiscal|year of presidency would strive to go further this would include improvement in business depreciation taxis so can stimulate investment in order to get plant and equipment replace put more americans back to work and put nation back on the road to be competitive in world commerce will also work to reduce the cost of government as a percentage of gross national product the first task of national leadership be to set honest and realistic priority in policy and budget and pledge that administration will do that when talk of tax cut be remind that every major tax cut in this|century have strengthen the economy generate renew productivity and end up yield new revenue for the government by create new investment new job and more commerce among people the present administration have be force by republicans to play follow the leader with regard to a tax cut but in this|election|year must take with the proverbial grain of salt any tax cut propose by those who have give the great tax increase in history when those in leadership give tax increase and tell must also do with less have think about those who have always have less especially the minority this be like tell that just as step on the first rung of the ladder of opportunity the ladder be be pull out from under that may be the democratic leadership 's message to the minority but will not be ours message will be have to move ahead but be not go to leave anyone behind thank to the economic policy of million of americans find out of work million more have never even have a fair chance to learn new skill hold a decent job or secure for and family a share in the prosperity of this nation be time to put america back to work to make city and town resound with the confident voice of man and woman of all race nationality and faith bring home to family a decent paycheck can cash for honest money for those without skill will find a way to help get skill for those without job opportunity will stimulate new opportunity particularly in the inner city where live for those who have abandon hope will restore hope and will welcome into a great national crusade to make america great again when move from domestic affair and cast eye abroad see an equally sorry chapter on the record of the present administration as soviet combat brigade train in cuba just|90|miles from shore a soviet army of invasion occupy afghanistan further threaten vital interest in the|middle|east america 's defense strength be at low ebb in a generation while the|soviet|union be vastly outspende in both strategic and conventional arm european ally look nervously at the grow menace from the east turn to for leadership and fail to find and incredibly more|than|50 of fellow americans have be hold captive for over|eight|month by a dictatorial foreign power that hold up to ridicule before the world adversary large and small test will and seek to confound resolve but be give weakness when need strength vacillation when the time demand firmness the carter administration live in the world of make believe every|day draw up a response to that day 's problem trouble regardless of what happen yesterday and what will happen tomorrow the rest of however live in the real world be here that disaster be overtake nation without any real response from washington this be make believe self deceit and above all transparent hypocrisy for example mr. carter say support the volunteer army but let military pay and benefit slip so low that many of enlisted personnel be actually eligible for food stamp re - enlistment rate drop and just recently after fight all|week against a proposal to increase the pay of man and woman in uniform helicoptere to carrier the|u.s.s.|nimitz which be return from long month of duty tell the crew that advocate well pay for and comrade where do really stand now that be back on shore will tell where stand do not favor a peacetime draft or registration but do favor pay and benefit level that will attract and keep highly motivated man and woman in volunteer force and an active reserve train and ready for an instant call in case of an emergency there may be a sailor at the helm of the ship of state but the ship have no rudder critical decision be make at time almost in comic fashion but who can laugh who be not embarrassed when the administration hand a major propaganda victory in the|united|nation to the enemy of israel staunch middle|east ally for three|decades and claim that the american vote be a mistake the result of a failure of communication between the president secretary of state and u.n. ambassador who do not feel a grow sense of unease as ally face repeat instance of an amateurish and confused administration reluctantly conclude that america be unwilling or unable to fulfill obligation as the leader of the free world who do not feel rise alarm when the question in any discussion of foreign policy be no longer should do something but do have the capacity to do anything the administration which have bring to this state be seek endorsement for four|more|year of weakness indecision mediocrity and incompetence no american should vote until or have ask be the|united|state strong and more respected now than be and a half year ago be the world today a safe place in which to live be the responsibility of the president of the|united|state in work for peace to insure that the safety of people can not successfully be threaten by a hostile foreign power as president fulfil that responsibility will be number priority be not a warlike people quite the opposite always seek to live in peace resort to force infrequently and with great reluctance and only after have determine that be absolutely necessary be awe and rightly so by the force of destruction at loose in the world in this nuclear era but neither can be naive or foolish time in lifetime america have go to war bleed the life of young man into the sand of beachhead the field of europe and the jungle and rice paddy of asia know only too well that war come not when the

overwhelming dependence of the western democracy on oil supply from the|middle|east and the press of social and religious and economic and political change in the many nation of the develop world exemplify by the revolution in iran each of these factor be important in own right each interact with the other all must be face together squarely and courageously will face these challenge and will meet with the good that be in and will not fail in response to the abhorrent act in iran nation have never be arouse and unify so greatly in peacetime position be clear the|united|state will not yield to blackmail continue to pursue these specific goal first to protect the present and long range interest of the|united|state secondly to preserve the life of the american hostage and to secure as quickly as possible safe release if possible to avoid bloodshed which may further endanger the life of fellow citizen to enlist the help of other nation in condemn this act of violence which be shocking and violate the moral and the legal standard of a civilized world and also to convince and to persuade the iranian leader that the real danger to nation lie in the north in the|soviet|union

will be pay will never rest until every of the american hostage be release but now face a broad and more fundamental challenge in this region because of the recent military action of the|soviet|union now as during the|last|three|and|a|half|decade the relationship between country and the|soviet|union be the most critical factor in determine whether the world will live at peace or be engulf in global conflict since the|end|of|the|second|world|war america have lead other nation in meet the challenge of mount soviet power this have not be a simple or a static relationship between there have be cooperation there have be competition and at time there have be confrontation in the|1940s take the lead in create in response to the|soviet|union 's suppression and then consolidation of east|european empire and the result threat of in the|1950s help to contain further soviet challenge in korea and in the|middle|east and rearm to assure the continuation of that containment in the|1960s meet the soviet challenge in berlin and face the cuban missile crisis and seek to engage the|soviet|union in the important task of move beyond the cold war and away from confrontation and in

and have demand the immediate withdrawal of soviet troop the moslem world be especially and justifiably outrage by this aggression against an islamic people no action of a world power have ever be so quickly and so overwhelmingly condemn but verbal condemnation be not enough the|soviet|union must pay a concrete price for aggression while this invasion continue and the other nation of the world can

because of the kidnaping of innocent american hostage and the holding of by militant terrorist with the support and the approval of iranian official purpose continue to be the protection of the longrange interest of nation and the safety of the american hostage be attempt to secure the release of the americans through the|international|court|of|justice through the|united|nation and through public and private diplomatic effort be determined to achieve this goal hope to do so without bloodshed and without any further danger to the life of fellow americans in these effort continue to have the strong support of the world community the unity and the common sense of the american people under such try circumstance be essential to the success of effort recently there have be another very serious development which threaten the maintenance of the peace in southwest|asia massive soviet military force have invade the small nonaligned sovereign nation of afghanistan which have hitherto not be an occupied satellite of the|soviet|union fifty|thousand heavily armed soviet troop have cross the border and be now disperse throughout afghanistan attempt to conquer the fiercely independent muslim people of that country the soviets claim falsely that be invite into afghanistan to help protect that country from some unnamed outside threat but the president who have be the leader of afghanistan before the soviet invasion be assassinated?along with several member of family?after the soviets gain control of the capital city of kabul only|several|days|later be the new puppet leader even bring into afghanistan by the soviets this invasion be an extremely serious threat to peace because of the threat of further soviet expansion into neighboring country in southwest|asia and also because such an aggressive military policy be unsettling to other people throughout the world this be a callous violation of international law and the|united|nations|charter be a deliberate effort of a powerful atheistic government to subjugate an independent islamic people must recognize the strategic importance of afghanistan to stability and peace a soviet occupy afghanistan threaten both iran and pakistan and be a steppingstone to possible control over much of the world 's oil supply the|united|state want all nation in the region to be free and to be independent if the soviets be encourage in this invasion by eventual success and if maintain dominance over afghanistan and then extend control to adjacent country the stable strategic and peaceful balance of the entire world will be change this would threaten the security of all nation include of course the|united|state ally and friend therefore the world simply can not stand by and permit the|soviet|union to commit this act with impunity nation have petition the|united|nations|security|council to condemn the|soviet|union and to demand the immediate withdrawal of all soviet troop from afghanistan realize that under the|united|nations|charter the|soviet|union and other permanent member may veto action of the|security|council if the will of the|security|council should be thwart in this manner then immediate action would be appropriate in the|general|assembly|of|the|united|nation where no soviet veto exist in the meantime neither the|united|state nor any other nation which be commit to world peace and stability can continue to do business as usual with the|soviet|union have already recall the|united|state ambassador from moscow hack to washington be work with and with other senior adviser in an immediate and comprehensive evaluation of the whole range of relation with the|soviet|union the successful negotiation of treaty have be a major goal and a major achievement of this administration and americans the people of the|soviet|union and indeed the entire world will benefit from the successful control of strategic nuclear weapon through the implementation of this carefully negotiate treaty however because of the soviet aggression have ask the|united|states|senate to defer further consideration of the|salt|ii treaty so that the congress and can assess soviet action and intention and devote primary attention to the legislative and other measure require to respond to this crisis as circumstance change in the future will of course keep the ratification of salt ii under active review in consultation with the leader of the senate the soviets must understand deep concern will delay opening of any new american or soviet consular facility and most of the cultural and economic exchange currently under consideration will be defer trade with the|soviet|union will be severely restrict have decide to halt or to reduce export to the|soviet|union in area that be particularly important to these new policy be be and will be coordinate with those of ally have direct that no high technology or other strategic item will be license for sale to the|soviet|union until further notice while

sell will not be deliver this grain be not intend for human consumption but be to be use for build up soviet livestock herd be determined to minimize any adverse impact on the american farmer from this action the undelivered grain will be remove from the market through storage and price support program and through purchase at market price will also increase amount of grain devote to the alleviation of hunger in poor country and will have a massive increase of the use of grain for gasohol production here at home after consultation with other principal grain export nation be confident that will not replace these quantity of grain by additional shipment on part to the|soviet|union these action will require some sacrifice on the part of all americans but there be absolutely no doubt that these action be in the interest of world peace and in the interest of the security of own nation and be also compatible with action be take by own major trading partner and other who share deep concern about this new soviet threat to world stability although the|united|states would prefer not to withdraw from the olympic game schedule in moscow this|summer the|soviet|union must realize that continued aggressive action will endanger both the participation of athlete and the travel to moscow by spectator who would normally wish to attend the olympic game along with other country will provide military equipment food and other assistance to help pakistan defend independence and national security against the seriously increase threat now face from the north the|united|state also

of improve circumstance beyond what be tell be fact there be those in land today however who would have believe that the|united|state like other great civilization of the past have reach the zenith of power that be weak and fearful reduce to bicker with each other and no longer possess of the will to cope with problem much of this talk have come from leader who claim that problem be too difficult to handle be suppose to meekly accept failure as the most which humanly can be do tell must learn to live with less and teach child that life will be less full and prosperous than our have be that the|america|of the|coming|year will be a place where â€” because of past excess will be impossible to dream and make those dream come true do not believe that and do not believe do either that be why

president would use every power at command to make the federal establishment respond to the will and the collective wish of the people must force the entire federal bureaucracy to live in the real world of reduced spending streamlined function and accountability to the people serve must review the function of the federal government to determine which of those be the proper province of level of government closer to the people the 10th article of the|bill|of|rights be explicit in point out that the federal government should do only those thing specifically call for in the constitution all other shall remain with the state or the people have not be observe that 10th article of late the federal government have take on function be never intend to perform and which do not perform well there should be a plan orderly transfer of such function to state and community and a transfer with of the source of taxation to pay for the saving in administrative would be considerable and certainly there would be increase efficiency and less bureaucracy by reduce federal tax rate where discourage individual initiative â€” especially personal income tax rate â€” can restore incentive invite great economic growth and at the same time help give well government instead of big government proposal such as the kemp roth bill would bring about this kind of realistic reduction in tax rate in short a punitive tax system must be replace by that restore incentive for the worker and for industry a system that reward initiative and effort and encourage thrift all these thing be possible none of will be easy but the choice be clear can go on let the country slip over the brink to financial ruin with the disaster that mean for the individual or can find the will to work together to restore confidence in and to regain the confidence of the world have live through depression carry with the memory of a christmas eve when brother and and parent exchange modest gift there be no lighted tree as there have be on christmases past remember watch father open what think be a greeting from employer all watch and yes be hope for a bonus check be notice that no longer have a job and in those|day the government run radio announcement tell worker not to leave home look for job there be no job will carry with always the memory of father sit there hold that envelope unable to look at can not and will not stand by while inflation and joblessness destroy the dignity of people another serious problem which must be discuss tonight be energy situation country be build on cheap energy today energy be not cheap and face the prospect that some form of energy may soon not be available at all last|summer probably spend hour sit in gasoline line this|winter some will be without heat and everyone will be pay much more simply to keep home and family warm if ever have any doubt of the government â€™s inability to provide for the need of the people just look at the utter fiasco now call â€œ the energy crisis not straight answer nor any realistic hope of relief have come from the present administration in almost|three|years of federal treatment of the problem as gas line grow the administration again panic and now have propose to put the country on a wartime footing but for this war there be no victory in sight and as always when the federal bureaucracy fail all can suggest be more of the same this time â€™ another bureau to untangle the mess make by the one already have but this just will not work solve the energy crisis will not be easy but can be do first must decide that less be not enough next must remove government obstacle to energy production and must make use of those technological advantage still possess be no program simply to say use less energy of course waste must be eliminate and efficiency promote but not an energy policy at good mean will run out of energy a little more slowly but a day will come when the light will dim and the wheel of industry will turn more slowly and finally stop as president will not endorse any course which have this as principle objective need more energy and that mean diversify source of supply away from the opec country yes mean more efficient automobile but also mean more exploration and development of oil and natural gas here in own country the only way to free from the monopoly pricing power of opec be to be less dependent on outside source of fuel the answer obvious to anyone except those in the administration seem be more domestic production of oil and gas must also have wide use of nuclear power within strict safety rule of course there must be more spending by the energy industry on research and development of substitute for fossil fuel in year to come solar energy may provide much of the answer but for the|next|two|or|three|decades must do such thing as master the chemistry of coal put the market system to work for these objective be an essential first step for achievement additional multi - billion|dollar federal bureaus and program be not the answer in recent|week there have be much talk about excess oil company profit do not believe have be give all the information need to make a judgement about this should have that information government exist to protect from each other be not government â€™s function to allocate fuel or impose unnecessary restriction on the marketplace be government â€™s function to determine whether be be unfairly exploit and if so to take immediate and appropriate action as president would do exactly that on the foreign front the|decade of the 's will place severe pressure upon the|united|state and ally can expect to be test in way calculate to try patience to confound resolve and to erode belief in during a time when the|soviet|union may enjoy nuclear superiority over this country must never waiver in commitment to ally nor accept any negotiation which be not clearly in the national interest must judge carefully though should leave no initiative untried in pursuit of peace must be clear voice in resolve to resist any unpeaceful act wherever may occur negotiation with the|soviet|union must never become appeasement for the most of have be preoccupy with the global struggle the competition with the|soviet|union and with responsibility to ally but too often in recent time have just drift along with event respond as if think of as a nation in decline to ally seem to appear to be a nation unable to make decision in own interest let alone in the common interest since have spend large amount of money and much of time protect and defend freedom all over the world must continue this for if do not accept the responsibility of leadership who will and if no one will how will survive the â€™s have teach the foolhardiness of not have a long range diplomatic strategy of own the world have become a place where in order to survive country need more than just ally need real friend yet in recent time often seem not to have recognize who friend be this must change be now time to take stock of own house and to resupply strength part of that process involve take stock of relationship with puerto|rico favor statehood for puerto|rico and if the people of puerto|rico vote for statehood in come referendum would as president initiate the enable legislation to make this a reality live on a continent whose country possess the asset to make the strong most prosperous and self sufficient area on earth within the border of this north|american continent be the food resource technology and undeveloped territory which properly manage could dramatically improve the quality of life of all inhabitant be no accident that this unmatched potential for progress and prosperity exist in country with such long stand heritage of free government a develop closeness among canada mexico and the|united|state a north|american accord would permit achievement of that potential in each country beyond that which believe any of â€” strong as be could accomplish in the absence of such cooperation in fact the key to own future security may lie in both mexico and canada become much strong country than be today no one can say at this point what form future cooperation among country will take but if be elect president would be willing to invite each of neighbor to send a special representative to government to sit in on high level planning session with as partner mutually concerned about the future of continent first would immediately seek the view and idea of canadian and mexican leader on this issue and work tirelessly with to develop close tie among people be time stop think of near neighbor as foreigner by develop method of work closely together will lay the foundation for future cooperation on a broad and more significant scale will also put to rest any doubt of those cynical enough to believe that the|united|states would seek to dominate any relationship among country or foolish enough to think that the government and people of canada and mexico would ever permit such domination to occur for be confident that can show the world by example that the nation of north|america be ready within the context of an unswerving commitment to freedom to seek new form of accommodation to meet a change world a develop closeness between the|united|state canada and mexico would serve notice on friend and foe alike that be prepare for a long haul look outward again and confident of future that together be go to create job to generate new fortune of wealth for many and provide a legacy for the child of each of country year ago teach the world that a new form of government create out of the genius of man to cope with circumstance could succeed in bring a measure of quality to human life previously think impossible now let work toward the goal of use the asset of this continent resource technology and foodstuff in the most efficient way possible for the common good of all people may take but can dare to dream that at some future date a map of the world may show the north|american continent as in which the people and commerce of strong country flow more freely across present border than do today in recent|months leader in government have tell that the people have lose confidence in that must regain the spirit and will to achieve national goal well be true there be a lack of confidence an unease with thing the way be but the confidence have lose be confidence in government â€™s policy unease can almost be call bewilderment at how defense strength have deteriorate the great productivity of

president of the|united|state promise a president who be not isolate from the people who feel pain and who share dream and who draw strength and wisdom from during the|past|3|years have speak to on many occasion about national concern the energy crisis reorganize the government nation 's economy and issue of war and especially peace but over those|year the subject of the speech the talk and the press conference have become increasingly narrow focus more and more on what the isolated world of washington think be important gradually have hear more and more about what the government think or what the government should be do and less and less about nation 's hope dream and vision of the future ten|days|ago have plan to speak to again about a very important subject energy for the fifth time would have describe the urgency of the problem and lay out a series of legislative recommendation to the congress but as be prepare to speak begin to ask the same question that now know have be trouble many of why have not be able to get together as a nation to resolve serious energy problem be clear that the true problem of nation be much deep deep than gasoline line or energy shortage deeper even than inflation or recession and realize more than ever that as president need help so decide to reach out and listen to the voice of america invite to camp|david people from almost every segment of society business and labor teacher and preacher governors mayor and private citizen and then leave camp|david to listen to other americans man and woman like have be an|extraordinary|10|day and want to share with what have hear first of all get a lot of personal advice let quote a few of the typical comment that write down this from a southern governor mr. president be not lead this nationâ€” be just manage the government do not see the people enough any more some of cabinet member do not seem loyal there be not enough discipline among disciple do not talk to about politic or the mechanic of government but about an understanding of common good mr. president be in trouble talk to about blood and sweat and tear if lead mr. president will follow many people talk about and about the condition of nation this from a young woman in pennsylvania feel so far from government feel like ordinary people be exclude from political power and this from a young chicano some of have suffer from recession all life some people have waste energy but other have not have anything to waste and this from a religious leader no material shortage can touch the important thing like god 's love for or love for another and like this one particularly from a black woman who happen to be the mayor of a small mississippi town the big shot be not the only one who be important remember can not sell anything on wall street unless someone dig up somewhere else first this kind of summarize a lot of other statement mr. president be confront with a moral and a spiritual crisis several of discussion be on energy and have a notebook full of comment and advice will read just a few can not go on consume more energy than produce when import oil be also import inflation plus unemployment have get to use what have the|middle|east have only|5|percent of the world 's energy but the|united|state have and this be of the most vivid statement neck be stretch over the fence and opec have a knife there will be other cartel and other shortage american wisdom and courage right now can set a path to follow in the future this be a good one be bold mr. president may make mistake but be ready to experiment and this one from a labor leader get to the heart of the real issue be freedom must deal with the energy problem on a war footing and the last that will read when enter the moral equivalent of war mr. president do not issue bb gun these|10|day confirm belief in the decency and the strength and the wisdom of the american people but also bear out some of longstanding concern about nation 's underlie problem know of course be president that government action and legislation can be very important that be why have work hard to put campaign promise into law and have to admit with just mixed success but after listen to the american people have be remind again that all the legislation in the world can not fix what be wrong with america so want to speak to first tonight about a subject even more serious than energy or inflation want to talk to right now about a fundamental threat to american democracy do not mean political and civil liberty will endure and do not refer to the outward strength of america a nation that be at peace tonight everywhere in the world with unmatched economic power and military might the threat be nearly invisible in ordinary way be a crisis of confidence be a crisis that strike at the very heart and soul and spirit of national will can see this crisis in the grow doubt about the meaning of own life and in the loss of a unity of purpose for nation the erosion of confidence in the future be threaten to destroy the social and the political fabric of america the confidence that have always have as a people be not simply some romantic dream or a proverb in a dusty book that read just on the fourth of july be the idea which found nation and have guide development as a people confidence in the future have support everything else public institution and private enterprise own family and the very constitution|of the|united|state confidence have define course and have serve as a link between generation have always believe in something call progress have always have a faith that the|days of child would be well than own people be lose that faith not only in government but in the ability as citizen to serve as the ultimate ruler and shaper of democracy as a people know past and be proud of progress have be part of the live history of america even the world always believe that be part of a great movement of humanity call democracy involve in the search for freedom and that belief have always strengthen in purpose but just as be lose confidence in the future be also begin to close the door on past in a nation that be proud of hard work strong family close knit community and faith in god too many of now tend to worship self indulgence and consumption human identity be no longer define by what one do but by what one own but have discover that own thing and consume thing do not satisfy longing for meaning have learn that pile up material good can not fill the emptiness of life which have no confidence or purpose the symptom of this crisis of the american spirit be all around for the first time in the history of country a majority of people believe that the|next|5|years will be bad than the|past|5|years third of people do not even vote the productivity of american worker be actually drop and the willingness of americans to save for the future have fall below that of all other people in the western world as know there be a grow disrespect for government and for church and for school the news medium and other institution this be not a message of happiness or reassurance but be the truth and be a warning these change do not happen overnight have come upon gradually over the|last|generation,|year that be fill with shock and tragedy be sure that be a nation of the ballot not the bullet until the murder of john|kennedy and robert|kennedy and martin|luther|king jr. be teach that army be always invincible and cause be always just only to suffer the agony of vietnam respect the presidency as a place of honor until the shock of watergate remember when the phrase sound as a dollar be an expression of absolute dependability until of inflation begin to shrink dollar and saving believe that nation 's resource be limitless until when have to face a grow dependence on foreign oil these wound be still very deep have never be heal look for a way out of this crisis people have turn to and find isolate from the mainstream of nation 's life washington d.c. have become an island the gap between citizen and government have never be so wide the people be look for honest answer not easy answer clear leadership not false claim and evasiveness and politic as usual what see too often in washington and elsewhere around the country be a system of government that seem incapable of action see a congress twist and pull in every direction by hundred of well finance and powerful special interest see every extreme position defend to the last vote almost to the last breath by unyielding group or another often see a balanced and a fair approach that demand sacrifice a little sacrifice from everyone abandon like an orphan without support and without friend often see paralysis and stagnation and drift do not like and neither do i. what can do first of all must face the truth and then can change course simply must have faith in each other faith in ability to govern and faith in the future of this nation restore that faith and that confidence to america be now the most important task face be a true challenge of this generation of americans of the visitor to camp|david last|week put this way have get to stop cry and start sweat stop talk and start walk stop curse and start pray the strength need will not come from the|white|house but from every house in america know the strength of america be strong can regain unity can regain confidence be the heir of generation who survive threat much more powerful and awesome than those that challenge now father and mother be strong man and woman who shape a new society during the|great|depression who fight world war and who carve out a new charter of peace for the world be the same americans who just|10|years|ago put a man on the moon be the generation that dedicate society to the pursuit of human right and equality and be the generation that will win the war on the energy problem and in that process rebuild the unity and confidence of america be at a turning point in history there be path to choose be a path have warn about|tonight the path that lead to fragmentation and self interest down that road lie a mistaken idea of freedom the right to grasp for some advantage over other that path would be of constant conflict between narrow interest end in chaos and immobility be a certain route to failure all the tradition of past all the lesson of heritage all the promise of future point to another path the path of common purpose and the restoration of american value that path lead to true freedom for nation and can take the first step down that path as begin to solve energy problem energy will be the immediate test of ability to unite this nation and can also be the standard around which rally on the battlefield of energy can win for nation a new confidence and can seize control again of common destiny in little|more|than|two|decade have go from a position of energy independence to in which almost|half the oil use come from foreign country at price that be go through the roof excessive dependence on opec have already take a tremendous toll on economy and people this be the direct cause of the long line which have make million of spend aggravating|hours wait for gasoline be a cause of the increase inflation and unemployment that now face this intolerable dependence on foreign oil threaten economic independence and the very security of nation the energy crisis be real be worldwide be a clear and present danger to nation these be fact and simply must face what have to say to now about energy be simple and vitally important point be tonight set a clear goal for the energy policy of the|united|state begin this moment this nation will never use more foreign oil than do in from now on every new addition to demand for energy will be meet from own production and own conservation the generation long growth in dependence on foreign oil will be stop dead in track right now and then reverse as move through the 's for be tonight set the further goal of cut dependence on foreign oil by half by the|end|of|the|next|decade a saving of of import oil per day point to ensure that meet these target will use presidential authority to set import quota be announce tonight that for and will forbid the entry into this country of drop of foreign oil more than these goal allow these quota will ensure a reduction in import even below the ambitious level set at the recent tokyo summit point to give energy security be ask for the most massive peacetime commitment of fund and resource in nation 's history to develop america 's own alternative source of fuel from coal from oil shale from plant product for gasohol from unconventional gas from the sun propose the creation of an energy security corporation to lead this effort to replace of import oil per day by the corporation will issue up|to|$5|billion in energy bond and especially want to be in small denomination so that average americans can invest directly in america 's energy security just as a similar synthetic rubber corporation help win world|war|ii so will mobilize american determination and ability to win the energy war moreover will soon submit legislation to congress call for the creation of this nation 's first solar bank which will help achieve the crucial goal of of energy come from solar power by the|year|2000 these effort will cost money a lot of money and that be why congress must enact the windfall profit tax without delay will be money well spend unlike the|billions|of|dollar that ship to foreign country to pay for foreign oil these fund will be pay by americans to americans these fund will go to fight not to increase inflation and unemployment point be ask congress to mandate to require as a matter of law that nation 's utility company cut massive use of oil by within and switch to other fuel especially coal most abundant energy source point to make absolutely certain that nothing stand in the way of achieve these goal will urge congress to create an energy mobilization board which like the|war|production|board in world|war|ii will have the responsibility and authority to cut through the redtape the delay and the endless roadblock to complete key energy project will protect environment but when this nation critically need a refinery or a pipeline will build point be propose a bold conservation program to involve every state county and city and every average american in energy battle this effort will permit to build conservation into home and life at a cost can afford ask congress to give authority for mandatory conservation and for standby gasoline ration to further conserve energy be propose tonight an extra over to strengthen public transportation system and be ask for good and for nation 's security to take no unnecessary trip to use carpool or public transportation whenever can to park car extra day per week to obey the speed limit and to set thermostat to save fuel every act of energy conservation like this be more than just common sense tell be an act of patriotism nation must be fair to the poor among so will increase aid to needy americans to cope with rise energy price often think of conservation only in term of sacrifice in fact be the most painless and immediate way of rebuild nation 's strength every gallon of oil each of save be a new form of production give more freedom more confidence that much more control over own life so the solution of energy crisis can also help to conquer the crisis of the spirit in country can rekindle sense of unity confidence in the future and give nation and all of individually a new sense of purpose know can do have the natural resource have more oil in shale alone than several saudi arabias have more coal than any nation on earth have the world 's high level of technology have the most skilled work force with innovative genius and firmly believe that have the national will to win this war do not promise that this struggle for freedom will be easy do not promise a quick way out of nation 's problem when the truth be that the only way out be an all out effort what do promise be that will lead fight and will enforce fairness in struggle and will ensure honesty and above all will act can manage the short term shortage more effectively and will but there be no short term solution to long range problem there be simply no way to avoid sacrifice from now will speak again in kansas|city to expand and to explain further energy program just as the search for solution to energy shortage have now lead to a new awareness of nation 's deep problem so willingness to work for those solution in energy can strengthen to attack those deep problem will continue to travel this country to hear the people of america can help to develop a national agenda for the|1980s will listen and will act will act together these be the promise make and intend to keep little by little can and must rebuild confidence can spend until empty treasury and may summon all the wonder of science but can succeed only if tap great resource america 's people america 's value and america 's confidence have see the strength of america in the inexhaustible resource of people in the|days to come let renew that strength in the struggle for an energy secure nation in closing let say this will do good but will not do alone let voice be hear whenever have a chance say something good about country with god 's help and for the sake of nation be time for to join hand in america let commit

the|soviet|union deterrent be overwhelming and will sign no agreement unless deterrent force will remain overwhelming a salt agreement of course can not substitute for wise diplomacy or a strong defense nor will end the danger of nuclear war but will certainly reduce that danger will strengthen effort to ban nuclear test and to stop the spread of atomic weapon to other nation and can begin the process of negotiate new agreement which will further limit nuclear arm the path of arm control back by a strong defense the path nation and every president have walk for can lead to a world of

good evening want to have a frank talk with tonight about most serious domestic problem that problem be inflation inflation can threaten all the economic gain have make and can stand in the way of what want to achieve in the future this have be a long time threat for the|last|10|year the annual inflation rate in the|united|state have average and during the|3|years|before inauguration have increase to an average of inflation have therefore be a serious problem for ever since become president have try to control but have not be successful be time for all of to make a great and a more coordinated effort if inflation get bad several thing will happen purchasing power will continue to decline and most of the burden will fall on those who can least afford national productivity will suffer the value of dollar will continue to fall in world trade have make good progress in put people back to work over the|past|21|month have create more|than|6|million new job for american worker have reduce the unemployment rate by about|25|percent and will continue effort to reduce unemployment further especially among young people and minority but must tell tonight that inflation threaten this progress if do not get inflation under control will not be able to reduce unemployment further and may even slide backward inflation be obviously a serious problem what be the solution do not have all the answer nobody do perhaps there be no complete and adequate answer but want to let know that fight inflation will be a central preoccupation of mine during the|months|ahead and want to arouse nation to join in this effort there be simplistic and familiar answer which be sometimes propose simple familiar and too extreme of these answer be to impose a complicated scheme of federal|government wage and price control on entire free economic system the other be a deliberate recession which would throw million of people out of work both of these extreme proposal would not work and must be reject have spend many|hours in the|last|few|month review with own adviser and with a number of outside expert every proposal every suggestion every possibility for eliminate inflation if there be thing have learn beyond any doubt be that there be no single solution for inflation what have instead be a number of partial remedy some of will help other may not but have no choice but to use the good approach have and to maintain a constant search for additional step which may be effective want to discuss with tonight some of the approach have be able to develop involve action by government business labor and every other sector of economy some of these factor be under control as president â€” especially government action and will insist that the government do part of the job but whether effort be successful will finally depend on as much as on decision make every|day at service station or grocery store in business in union meeting will determine nation 's answer to inflation as much as decision make here in the|white|house or by the congress on capitol|hill can not guarantee that joint effort will succeed in fact be almost certain not to succeed if success mean quick or dramatic change every free government on earth be wrestle with this problem of inflation and every of know that a long term disease require longterm treatment be up to to make the improvement can even at the risk of partial failure rather than to ensure failure by not try at all will concentrate effort within the government know that government be not the only cause of inflation but be of the cause and government do set an example therefore must take the lead in fiscal restraint be go to hold down government spending reduce the budget deficit and eliminate government waste will slash federal hiring and cut the federal work force will eliminate needless regulation will bring more competition back to economy and will oppose any further reduction in federal income taxis until have convincing prospect that inflation will be control let explain what each of these step mean the federal deficit be too high people be simply sick and tired of wasteful federal spending and the inflation bring with have already have some success have bring the deficit down by third since run for president â€” from more|than|$66|billion in fiscal|year|1976 to about|$40|billion in fiscal|year reduction of in the federal deficit in just|3|year will keep go down next|year with tough restraint on federal spending and moderate economic growth in prospect plan to reduce the budget deficit to half what be when run for office to or less the government have be spend too great a portion of what nation produce during campaign promise to cut the government 's share of total national spending from which be then to in fiscal|year|1981 now plan to meet that goal reduce the deficit will require difficult and unpleasant decision must face a time of national austerity hard choice be necessary if want to avoid consequence that be even bad intend to make those hard choice have already veto bill that would undermine fight against inflation and the congress have sustain those veto know that the congress will continue to cooperate in the effort to meet need in responsible noninflationary way will use the administrative and the budgetary power of office include the veto if necessary to keep nation firmly on the path of fiscal restraint restraint involve tax policy as well as spend decision tax reduction have never be more politically popular than be today but if future tax cut be make rashly with no eye on the budget deficit will hurt all by cause more inflation there be tax cut which could directly low cost and price and help in the fight against inflation may consider way to reduce those particular taxis while still cut the budget deficit but until have a convincing prospect of control inflation will oppose any further reduction in federal income taxis to keep the government to a manageable size be order tonight a cut in federal hiring this order will mean a reduction of more|than|20,000 in the number of permanent federal employee already budget for this|fiscal|year and will cut the total size of the federal work force have already place a cap on the pay increase for federal employee and federal executive officer be receive no pay increase at all be not enough just to control government deficit spending and hire must also control the cost of government regulation in recent|years congress have pass a number of landmark statute to improve social and environmental condition must and will continue progress toward protect the health and safety of the american people but must also realize that everything have a price and that consumer eventually pick up the tab where regulation be essential must be efficient where fight inflation should be encourage where be unnecessary should be remove early|this|year direct federal agency to eliminate unnecessary regulation and to analyze the cost and benefit of new one today for instance the|occupational|safety|and|health|administration sometimes call osha eliminate nearly|1,000 unnecessary regulation now can build on this progress have direct a council of regulatory department and agency to coordinate regulation to prevent overlapping and duplication most important the council will develop a unified calendar of planned major regulation the calendar will give for the first time a comprehensive list of regulation be propose with cost and objective as president will personally use authority to ensure that regulation be issue only when need and that meet goal at the low possible cost be also cut away the regulatory thicket that have grow up around and give competitive free enterprise system a chance to grow up in place last|year give the airline industry a fresh shot of competition regulation be remove free market force drive price down record number of passenger travel and profit go up new airline deregulation bill will make these benefit permanent for the first time in decade have actually deregulate a major industry next year will work with congress to bring more competition to other such as the railroad and trucking industry of all weapon against inflation competition be the most powerful without real competition price and wage go up even when demand be go down must therefore work to allow more competition wherever possible so that powerful group government business labor must think twice before abuse economic power will redouble effort to put competition back into the american free enterprise system another reason for inflation be the slowdown in productivity growth more efficient production be essential if be to control inflation make american good more competitive in world market add new job and increase the real income of people have make a start toward improve productivity the tax bill just pass by the congress include many of the investment incentive that recommend last|january federal support for research and development will continue to increase especially for basic research will coordinate and strengthen federal program that support productivity improvement throughout economy government effort will attack the inflation that hurt most inflation in the essential food housing and medical care will continue to use agricultural policy to sustain farm production to maintain stable price and to keep inflation down rise interest rate have always accompany inflation add further to the cost of business expansion and to what consumer must pay when buy house and other consumer item the burden of control inflation can not be leave to monetary policy alone which must deal with the problem through tight restriction on money and credit that push interest rate up will work for a balanced concert and sustain program under which tight budget restraint private wage and price moderation and responsible monetary policy support each other if successful should expect low inflation and low interest rate for consumer and business alike as for medical care where cost have go up much faster than the general inflation rate the most important step can take be to pass a strong bill to control hospital cost this|year the senate pass next|year will try again and believe the whole congress will act to hold down hospital cost if own member of congress hear from between now and january when the new congress convene will be prepare a package of specific legislative proposal to help fight inflation the government will do part but in a country like our government can not do the job alone in the end the success or failure of this effort will also rest on whether the private sector will accept and act on the voluntary wage and price standard be announce tonight these standard be fair be standard that everyone can follow if do follow will slow price down so that wage will not have to chase price just to stay even and point the way toward an eventual cure for inflation by remove the pressure that cause in the first place in the|last|10|years in attempt to protect from inflation have develop attitude and habit that actually keep inflation go once have begin most company raise price because expect cost to rise union call for large wage settlement because expect inflation to continue because expect to happen do happen and once be start wage and price chase each other up and up be like a crowd stand at a football stadium no one can see any well than when everyone be sit down but no one be willing to be the first to sit down except for low pay worker be ask all employee in this country to limit total wage increase to a maximum of per year from tonight on every contract sign and every pay raise grant should meet this standard price limitation will be equally strict basic target for economy wide price increase be to reach this goal be tonight set a standard for each firm in the nation to hold price increase at|least|one half of percentage point below what average during and of course have to take into account bind commitment already in effect which will prevent an absolute adherence to these standard but this price standard be much low than this year 's inflation rate and more important be less than the standard for wage increase that difference be account for by rise productivity and will allow the income of america 's worker to stay ahead of inflation this be a standard for everyone to follow everyone as far as be concerned every business every union every professional group every individual in this country have no excuse not to adhere to these standard if meet these standard the real buying power of paycheck will rise the difficulty with a voluntary program be that worker fear that if cooperate with the standard while other do not then will suffer if inflation continue to deal with this concern will ask the congress next|january to enact a program that worker who observe the standard would be eligible for a tax rebate if the inflation rate be more|than|7|percent in other word would have a real wage insurance policy against inflation which may be cause by other this will give worker an additional incentive to observe the program and will remove only legitimate reason not to cooperate because this be not a mandatory control plan can not stop an irresponsible corporation from raise price or a selfish group of employee from use power to demand excessive wage but then if that happen the government will respond use the tool of government authority and public opinion soon after raise price or demand pay increase that be excessive the company or the union will feel the pressure that the public can exert through new competition to drive price down or removal of government protection and privilege which now enjoy will also make well use of the worth of purchase the government make from private industry each|year must be prudent buyer if cost rise too fast can delay those purchase as family would or switch to another supplier may not buy a fleet of car this|year for example if car cost too much or may channel purchase to supplier who have observe wage and price standard rather than to buy from those who have not will require firm that supply good and service to the government to certify compliance with the wage and price standard will make every effort within legal limit to deny government contract to company that fail to meet wage and price standard will use buying power more effectively to make price restraint and competition a reality the government now extend economic privilege to many part of the private economy â€” special franchise protect wage and price subsidy protection from foreign competition if wage or price rise too fast in some industry will take that as a sign that those privilege be no longer need and that this protection should be remove will make sure that no part of economy be able to use special privilege or concentrated power to victimize the rest of this approach have outline will not end inflation simply improve chance of make better rather than bad to summarize the plan be announce tonight will cut the budget deficit will slash federal hiring and reduce the federal work force will restrain federal pay will delay further tax cut will remove needless regulation will use federal policy to encourage more competition will set specific standard for both wage and price throughout the economy will use all the power at disposal to make this program work and will submit new anti - inflation proposal to the congress next|january include the real wage insurance proposal have discuss tonight have say many time that these step will be tough and be but also say will be fair and be apply equally to all group give all of an equal chance to move ahead and these proposal which give a chance also deserve a chance if tomorrow or next|week or next|month ridicule ignore pick apart before have a chance to work then will have reduce chance of succeed these step can work but that will take time and be the one who can give that time if there be thing be ask of every american tonight be to give this plan a chance to work a chance to work for can help give that chance by use influence business and labor must know that will not tolerate irresponsible price and wage increase elect official must know how feel as make difficult choice too often the only voice hear be those of special interest support own narrow cause if want government official to cut inflation have to make sure that hear voice have hear with unmistakable clarity nearly when the world watch to see whether nation would survive winston|churchill defy those who think britain would fall to the nazi threat churchill reply by ask countryman what kind of people do think be there be those today who say that a free economy can not cope with inflation and that have lose ability to act as a nation rather than as a collection of special interest and reply what kind of people do think be believe that people economic system and government be equal to this task

cure illiteracy or provide energy and government can not mandate goodness only a true partnership between government and the people can ever hope to reach these goal those of who govern can sometimes inspire and can identify need and marshal resource but simply can not be the manager of everything and everybody here in washington must move away from crisis management and must establish clear goal for the future immediate and the distant future which will let work together and not in conflict never again should neglect a grow crisis like the shortage of energy where further delay will only lead

but additional job for the disadvantaged deserve special attention have already pass law to assure equal access to the voting booth and to restaurant and to school to housing and law to permit access to job but job opportunity the chance to earn a decent living be also a basic human right which can not and will not ignore a major priority for nation be the final elimination of the barrier that restrict the opportunity available to woman and also to black people and hispanics and other minority have come a long way toward that goal but there be still much to do what inherit from the past must not be permit to shackle in the future will be ask for a substantial increase in fund for public job for young people and also be recommend that the congress continue the public service employment program at more than twice the level of a|year|ago when welfare reform be complete will have additional job so that those on welfare who be able to work can work however again know that in free society private business be still the good source of new job therefore will propose a new program to encourage business to hire young and disadvantaged americans these young people only need skill and a chance in order to take place in economic system let give the chance need a major step in the right direction would be the early passage of a greatly improve humphrey hawkins bill budget for address these national need but be lean and tight have cut waste wherever possible be propose an increase of less|than|2|percent after adjust for inflation the small increase in the federal budget in four|years lately federal spending have take a steadily increase portion of what americans produce new budget reverse that trend and later hope to bring the government 's toll down even further and with help will do that in time of high employment and a strong economy deficit spending should not be a feature of budget as the economy continue to gain strength and as unemployment rate continue to fall revenue will grow with careful planning efficient management and proper restraint on spending can move rapidly toward a balanced budget and will next year the budget deficit will be only slightly less than this|year but third of the deficit be due to the necessary tax cut that have propose this|year the right choice be to reduce the burden on taxpayer and provide more job for people the third element in program be a renew attack on inflation have learn the hard way that high unemployment will not prevent or cure inflation government can help by stimulate private investment and by maintain a responsible economic policy through a new top level review process will do a well job of reduce government regulation that drive up cost and drive up price but again government alone can not bring down the rate of inflation when a level of high inflation be expect to continue then company raise price to protect profit margin against prospective increase in wage and other cost while worker demand high wage as protection against expect price increase be like an escalation in the arm race and understandably no one want to disarm alone now no firm or a group of worker can halt this process be an effort that must all make together be therefore ask government business labor and other group to join in a voluntary program to moderate inflation by hold wage and price increase in each sector of the economy during below the average increase of the|last|two|year do not believe in wage and price control a sincere commitment to voluntary constraint provide a way perhaps the only way to fight inflation without government interference as come into the capitol tonight see the farmer fellow farmer stand out in the snow be familiar with problem and know from congress action that be too when be run carters|warehouse have spread on own farm fertilizer for about|$40 a ton the last time be home the price be about|$100 a ton the cost of nitrogen have go up and the price of product that farmer sell have either stay the same or go down a little now this|past|year in the congress and together pass a new agricultural act go into effect october|1 will have first impact on the crop will help a great deal will add or more to help the farmer with price support and target price last|year have the high level of export of farm product in the history of countryâ€”$24 expect to have more this|year will be work together but think be incumbent on to monitor very carefully the farm situation and continue to work harmoniously with the farmer of country what be good for the farmer the farm family in the long run be also good for the consumer of country economic success at home be also the key to success in international economic policy an effective energy program strong investment and productivity and control inflation will provide improve trade balance and balance and will help to protect the integrity of the dollar overseas by work closely with friend abroad can promote the economic health of the whole world with fair and balanced agreement lower the barrier to trade despite the inevitable pressure that build up when the world economy suffer from high unemployment must firmly resist the demand for self defeat protectionism but free trade must also be fair trade and be determined to protect american industry and american worker against foreign trade practice which be unfair or illegal in a separate write message to congress have outline other domestic initiative such as welfare reform consumer protection basic education skill urban policy reform of labor law and national health care later on this|year will not repeat these tonight but there be several other point that would like to make directly to during these|past|years americans have see government grow far from for some citizen the government have almost become like a foreign country so strange and distant that have often have to deal with through train ambassador who have sometimes become too powerful and too influential lawyer accountant and lobbyist this can not go on must have what abraham|lincoln want â€” a government for the people have make progress toward that kind of government have give the authority request to reorganize the federal bureaucracy and be use that authority have already begin a series of reorganization plan which will be complete over a period of three|years have also propose abolish almost|500 federal advisory and other commission and board but know that the american people be still sick and tired of federal paperwork and redtape bit by bit be chop down the thicket of unnecessary federal regulation by which government too often interfere in personal life and personal business have cut the public 's federal paperwork load by more|than|12|percent in less|than|a|year and be not through cut have make a good start on turn the gobbledygook of federal regulation into plain english that people can understand but know that still have a long way to go have bring together part of government agency to create a new department|of|energy and now be time to take another major step by create a separate department|of|education but even the best organized government will only be as effective as the people who carry out policy for this reason consider civil service reform to be absolutely vital work out with the civil servant this reorganization plan will restore the merit principle to a system which have grow into a bureaucratic maze will provide great management flexibility and well reward for well performance without compromise job security then and only then can have a government that be efficient open and truly worthy of people 's understanding and respect have promise that will have such a government and intend to keep that promise in foreign policy the separation of people from government have be in the past a source of weakness and error in a democratic system like our foreign policy decision must be able to stand the test of public examination and public debate if make a mistake in this administration will be on the side of frankness and openness with the american people in modern world when the death of literally million of people can result from a|few|terrifying|second of destruction the path of national strength and security be identical to the path of peace tonight be happy to report that because be strong nation

limit on both the quality and the quantity of the giant nuclear arsenal of both nation and then want actual reduction in strategic arm as a major step toward the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapon from the face of the earth if these talk result in an agreement this year and trust will â€” pledge to that the agreement will maintain and enhance the stability of the world 's strategic balance and the security of the|united|state for concert but unsuccessful effort have be make to ban the testing of atomic explosive both military weapon and peaceful nuclear device be hard at work with

about a need for a national policy to deal with present and future energy problem and the|next|day send proposal to the congress the congress have recognize the urgency of this problem and have come to grip with some of the most complex and difficult decision that a legislative body have ever be ask to make work with congress have now form a new department|of|energy head by secretary james|schlesinger have the ability to administer the new energy legislation and congressional work on the|national|energy|plan have now reach the final stage last|week the senate send version of the legislation to the conference committee where member of the house and senate will now resolve difference between the bill that have pass there in the|next|few|week the strength and courage of political system will be prove the choice face the members of congress be not easy for to pass an effective and fair plan will need support and understanding support to resist pressure from a few for special favor at the expense of the rest of and understanding that there can be no effective plan without some sacrifice from all of tonight at this crucial time want to emphasize why be so important that have an energy plan and what will risk as a nation if be timid or reluctant to face this challenge be crucial that understand how serious this challenge be with every|passing|month energy problem have grow bad use more oil and gasoline than ever before in history more of oil be come from foreign country just since april oil import have cost about|$350 worth of foreign oil for the average american family a|few|weeks|ago in detroit an unemployed steelworker tell something that may reflect the feeling of many of mr. president say do not feel much like talk about energy and foreign policy be concerned about how be go to live can not be too concerned about other thing when have a 10-year old daughter to raise and do not have a job and be well understand how feel but must tell the truth and the truth be that can not talk about economic problem now or in the future without talk about energy let try to describe the size and the effect of the problem farmer be the great agricultural exporter the world have ever know but now take all the food and fiber that export in just to pay for of import oil about|$45|billion this excessive importing of foreign oil be a tremendous and rapidly increase drain on national economy hurt every american family cause unemployment every increase in oil import cost american job cost business investment vast amount of american wealth no longer stay in the|united|state to build factory and to give a well life make harder for to balance federal budget and to finance need program for people unbalance nation 's trade with other country this|year primarily because of oil import will be at|least|$25|billion more than all the american good the sell overseas push up international energy price because excessive importing of oil by the|united|state make easy for foreign producer to raise price feed serious inflationary pressure in own economy if this trend continue the excessive reliance on foreign oil could make the very security of nation increasingly dependent on uncertain energy supply national security depend on more than just armed|force also rest on the strength of economy on national will and on the ability of the|united|state to carry out foreign policy as a free and independent nation america overseas be only as strong as america at home the secretary of defense say recently the present deficiency of assure energy source be the single sure threat to security and to that of ally yesterday after careful consideration announce the postponement of a major overseas trip until after christmas because of the paramount importance of develop an effective energy plan this|year have no doubt that this be the right decision because the other nation of the world â€” ally and adversary alike â€” await energy decision with a great interest and concern as of the world 's large producer of coal and oil and gas why do have this problem with energy and why be so difficult to solve problem be that the price of all energy be go up both because of increase scarcity and because the price of oil be not set in a free and competitive market the world price be set by a foreign cartel the government of the so call opec nation that price be now almost|five time as great as be in big problem however be that simply use too much and waste too much energy import have more than triple in the|last|10|years although all country could of course be more efficient be the bad offender since the great price rise in the japanese have cut oil import the germans the french the british the italians have all cut oil import meanwhile although have large petroleum supply of own and most of do not in the|united|state have increase import more|than|40|percent this problem have come upon suddenly ten|years|ago when foreign oil be cheap import just|2|1/2|million|barrel of oil a day about|20|percent of what use by be import about|30|percent this|year when foreign oil be very expensive be import nearly|9|million|barrel a day almost|one half of all the oil use unless act quickly import will continue to go up and all the problem that have just describe will grow even bad there be thing that must do to avoid this danger first cut back on consumption second shift away from oil and gas to other source of energy and third encourage production of energy here in the|united|state these be the purpose of the new energy legislation in order to conserve energy the congress be now act to make automobile home and appliance more efficient and to encourage industry to save both heat and electricity the congressional conference committee be now consider change in how electric power rate be set in order to discourage waste to reward those who use less energy and to encourage a change in the use of electricity to hour of the|day when demand be low another very important question before congress be how to let the market price for domestic oil go up to reflect the cost of replace while at the same time protect the american consumer and own economy must face an unpleasant fact about energy price be go up whether pass an energy program or not as fuel become more scarce and more expensive to produce the question be who should benefit from those rise price for oil already discover energy plan capture and return to the public where can stimulate the economy save more energy and create new job will use research and development project tax incentive and penalty and regulatory authority to hasten the shift from oil and gas to coal to wind and solar power to geothermal methane and other energy source have also propose and the congress be review incentive to encourage production of oil and gas here in own country this be where another major controversy arise be important that promote new oil and gas discovery and increase production by give adequate price to the producer have recommend that the price for instance of new natural gas be raise each|year to the average price of domestic oil that would produce the same amount of energy with this new policy the gross income of gas producer would average about|$2|billion each|year more than at the present price level new oil price would also rise in 3|year to the present world level and then be increase annually to keep up with inflation this incentive for new oil production would be the high in the whole world these proposal would provide adequate incentive for exploration and production of domestic oil and gas but some of the oil company want much more â€” ten of billions|of|dollar more want greatly increase price for old oil and gas energy supply which have already be discover and which be be produce now want immediate and permanent deregulation of gas price which would cost consumer or more between|now|and|1985 want even high price than those have propose for new gas and oil and want the high price sooner want low taxis on profit these be all controversial question and the congressional debate as can well imagine be intense the political pressure be great because the stake be so high billions|and|billions|of|dollars should reward individual and company who discover and produce new oil and gas but must not give huge windfall profit on exist well at the expense of the american people now the energy proposal that make to congress last|april have basic element to ensure that be well balanced first be fair both to the american consumer and to the energy producer and will not disrupt national economy second as have say before be design to meet important goal for energy conservation to promote a shift to more plentiful and permanent energy supply and encourage increase production of energy in the|united|state and third protect federal budget from any unreasonable burden these be the standard by which the final legislation must be judge will sign the energy bill only if meet these test during the|next|few|week the congress will make a judgment on these vital question will be work closely with and be also deeply involved in these decision this be not a contest of strength between the president and the congress nor between the house and the senate what be be measure be the strength and will of nation whether can acknowledge a threat and meet a serious challenge together be convinced that can have enough energy to permit the continue growth of economy to expand production and job and to protect the security of the|united|state if act wisely believe that this country can meet any challenge but this be an exceptionally difficult because the threat be not easy to see and the solution be neither simple nor politically popular say that no one would be completely satisfied with this national energy plan unfortunately that prediction have turn out to be right there be some part of this complex legislation to which every region and every interest group can object but a common national sacrifice to meet this serious problem should be share by everyone some proof that the plan be fair many group have rise to the challenge but unfortunately there be still some who seek personal gain over the national interest be also especially difficult to deal with long range future challenge a president be elect for just|4|year a senator for and representatives in congress for only|2|year be always be easy to wait until the|next|year or the next term of office to avoid political risk but do not choose elect official simply to fill an office the congress be face very difficult decision courageously and have form a good partnership all of in government need help this be an effort which require vision and cooperation from all americans hope that each of will take step to conserve precious energy and also join with elect official at all level of government to meet this test of nation 's judgment and will these be serious problem and this have be a serious talk but energy plan also reflect the optimism that feel about ability to deal with these problem the story of the human race be of adapt to change circumstance the history of nation be of meeting challenge and overcome this major legislation be a necessary first step on a long and difficult road this energy plan be a good insurance policy for the future in which relatively small premium that pay today will protect in the|years|ahead but if fail to act boldly today then will surely face a great series of crisis tomorrow energy shortage environmental damage ever more massive government bureaucracy and regulation and illconsidere last minute crash program hope that perhaps a|hundred|years|from|now the change to inexhaustible energy source will have be make and nation 's concern about energy will be over but can make that transition smoothly â€” for country and for child and for grandchild only if take careful step now to prepare for the future during the|next|few|week attention will be focus on the congress but the proving of courage and commitment will continue in different form and place in the|months|and|the|year even generation ahead be fitting that be speak to on an|election|day a|day which remind that the people be the ruler of this nation that government will be as courageous and effective and fair as demand that be this will not be the last time that as president present difficult and controversial choice to and ask for help believe that the duty of this office permit to do no less but be confident that can find the wisdom and the courage to make the right decision even when be unpleasant so that may together preserve the greatness of nation thank very much view

nation to provide more efficiently for the need of people to demonstrate against the dark faith of time that government can be both competent and more humane but want to speak to today about the strand that connect action overseas with essential character as a nation believe can have a foreign policy that be democratic that be base on fundamental value and that use power and influence which

better quench with water this approach fail with vietnam the good example of intellectual and moral poverty but through failure have now find way back to own principle and value and have regain lose confidence by the measure of history nation 's be very brief and rise to world eminence be briefer still date from when europe and the old international order lie in ruin before then be largely on the periphery of world affair but since then have inescapably be at the center of world affair policy during this period be guide by principle a belief that soviet expansion be almost inevitable but that must be contain and the correspond belief in the importance of an almost exclusive alliance among non - communist nation on both side of the atlantic that system could not last forever unchanged historical trend have weaken foundation the unifying threat of conflict with the|soviet|union have become less intensive even though the competition have become more extensive the vietnamese war produce a profound moral crisis sap worldwide faith in own policy and system of life a crisis of confidence make even more grave by the covert pessimism of some of leader in less than a generation have see the world change dramatically the daily life and aspiration of most human being have be transform colonialism be nearly go a new sense of national identity now exist in almost|100 new country that have be form in the last generation knowledge have become more widespread aspiration be high as more people have be free from traditional constraint more have be determine to achieve for the first time in life social justice the world be still divide by ideological dispute dominate by regional conflict and threaten by danger that will not resolve the difference of race and wealth without violence or without draw into combat the major military power can no longer separate the traditional issue of war and peace from the new global question of justice equity and human right be a new world but america should not fear be a new world and should help to shape be a new world that call for a new american foreign policy a policy base on constant decency in value and on optimism in historical vision can no longer have a policy solely for the industrial nation as the foundation of global stability but must respond to the new reality of a politically awaken world can no longer expect that the other nation will follow the dictate of the powerful but must continue confidently effort to inspire to persuade and to lead policy must reflect belief that the world can hope for more than simple survival and belief that dignity and freedom be fundamental spiritual requirement policy must shape an international system that will last longer than secret deal can not make this kind of policy by manipulation policy must be open must be candid must be of constructive global involvement rest on cardinal principle have try to make these premise clear to the american people since last|january let review what have be do and discuss what intend to do first have reaffirm america 's commitment to human right as a fundamental tenet of foreign policy in ancestry religion color place of origin and cultural background americans be as diverse a nation as the world have even see no common mystique of blood or soil unite what draw together perhaps more than anything else be a belief in human freedom want the world to know that nation stand for more than financial prosperity this do not mean that can conduct foreign policy by rigid moral maxim live in a world that be imperfect and which will always be imperfect a world that be complex and confused and which will always be complex and confused understand fully the limit of moral suasion have no illusion that change will come easily or soon but also believe that be a mistake to undervalue the power of word and of the idea that word embody in own history that power have range from thomas|paine 's common|sense to martin|luther|king jr. 's i|have|a|dream in the life of the human spirit word be action much more so than many of may realize who live in country where freedom of expression be take for grant the leader of totalitarian nation understand this very well the proof be that word be precisely the action for which dissident in those country be be persecute nonetheless can already see dramatic worldwide advance in the protection of the individual from the arbitrary power of the state for to ignore this trend would be to lose influence and moral authority in the world to lead will be to regain the moral stature that once have the great democracy be not free because be strong and prosperous believe be strong and influential and prosperous because be free throughout the world today in free nation and in totalitarian country as well there be a preoccupation with the subject of human freedom human right and believe be incumbent on in this country to keep that discussion that debate that contention alive no other country be as well qualified as to set an example have own shortcoming and fault and should strive constantly and with courage to make sure that be legitimately proud of what have have move deliberately to reinforce the bond among democracy in recent meeting in london agree to widen economic cooperation to promote free trade to strengthen the world 's monetary system to seek way of avoid nuclear proliferation prepare constructive proposal for the forthcoming meeting on north south problem of poverty development and global well being and agree on joint effort to reinforce and to modernize common defense may be interested in know that at this nato meeting for the first time in more|than|25|year all member be democracy even more important all of reaffirm basic optimism in the future of the democratic system spirit of confidence be spread together democracy can help to shape the wide architecture of global cooperation third have move to engage the|soviet|union in a joint effort to halt the strategic arm race this race be not only dangerous be morally deplorable must put an end to know will not be easy to reach agreement goal be to be fair to both side to produce reciprocal stability parity and security desire a freeze on further modernization and production of weapon and a continue substantial reduction of strategic nuclear weapon as well want a comprehensive ban on all nuclear testing a prohibition against all chemical warfare no attack capability against space satellite and arm limitation in the|indian|ocean hope that can take joint step with all nation toward a final agreement eliminate nuclear weapon completely from arsenal of death will persist in this effort now believe in detente with the|soviet|union to mean progress toward peace but the effect of detente should not be limit to own country alone hope to persuade the|soviet|union that country can not impose system of society upon another either through direct military intervention or through the use of a client state 's military force as be the case with cuban intervention in angola cooperation also imply obligation hope that the|soviet|union will join with and other nation in play a large role in aid the develop world for common aid effort will help build a bridge of mutual confidence in one another fourth be take deliberate step to improve the chance of last peace in the|middle|east through wide range consultation with leader of the country involve israel syria jordan and egypt have find some area of agreement and some movement toward consensus the negotiation must continue through own public comment have also try to suggest a more flexible framework for the discussion of the key issue which have so far be so intractable the nature of a comprehensive peace what be peace what do mean to the israelis what do mean to arab neighbor secondly the relationship between security and border how can the dispute over border delineation be establish and settle with a feeling of security on both side and the issue of the palestinian homeland the historic friendship that the|united|stat have with israel be not dependent on domestic politic in either nation be derive from common respect for human freedom and from a common search for permanent peace will continue to promote a settlement which all of need own policy will not be affect by change in leadership in any of the country in the|middle|east therefore expect israel and neighbor to continue to be bind by united|nations|resolution and which have previously accept this may be the most propitious time for a genuine settlement since the beginning of the arab israeli conflict almost|30|years|ago to let this opportunity pass could mean disaster not only for the|middle|east but perhaps for the international political and economic order as well and fifth be attempt even at the risk of some friction with friend to reduce the danger of nuclear proliferation and the worldwide spread of conventional weapon at the recent summit set in motion an international effort to determine the good way of harness nuclear energy for peaceful use while reduce the risk that product will be divert to the making of explosive have already complete a comprehensive review of own policy on arm transfer competition in arm sale be inimical to peace and destructive of the economic development of the poor country will as a matter of national policy now in country seek to reduce the annual dollar volume of arm sale to restrict the transfer of advanced weapon and to reduce the extent of coproduction arrangement about weapon with foreign state and just as important be try to get other nation both free and otherwise to join in this effort but all of this that have describe be just the beginning be a beginning aim towards a clear goal to create a wide framework of international cooperation suit to the new and rapidly change historical circumstance will cooperate more closely with the newly influential country in latin|america africa and asia need friendship and cooperation in a common effort as the structure of world power change more than year ago say that nation could not exist half slave and half free know a peaceful world can not long exist third rich and third hungry most nation share faith that in the long run expand and equitable trade will best help the develop country to help but the immediate problem of hunger disease illiteracy and repression be here now the western democracy the opec nation and the develop communist country can cooperate through exist international institution in provide more effective aid this be an excellent alternative to war have a special need for cooperation and consultation with other nation in this hemisphere to the north and to the south do not need another slogan although these be close friend and neighbor link with be the same link of equality that forge for the rest of the world will be deal with as part of a new worldwide mosaic of global regional and bilateral relation be important that make progress toward normalizing relation with the|people's|republic|of|china see the american and chinese relationship as a central element of global policy and china as a key force for global peace wish to cooperate closely with the creative chinese people on the problem that confront all mankind and hope to find a formula which can bridge some of the difficulty that still separate finally let say that be commit to a peaceful resolution of the crisis in southern africa the time have come for the principle of majority rule to be the basis for political order recognize that in a democratic system the right of the minority must also be protect to be peaceful change must come promptly the|united|state be determined to work together with european ally and with the concerned african states to shape a congenial international framework for the rapid and progressive transformation of southern african society and to help protect from unwarranted outside interference let conclude by summarize policy be base on an historical vision of america 's role policy be derive from a large view of global change policy be root in moral value which never change policy be reinforce by material wealth and by military power policy be design to serve mankind and be a policy that hope will make proud to be americans thank view transcript transcript good evening tonight want to have an unpleasant talk with about a problem that be unprecedented in history with the exception of prevent war this be the great challenge that country will face during lifetime the energy crisis have not yet overwhelm but will if do not act quickly be a problem that will not be able to solve in the|next|few|year and be likely to get progressively bad through the rest of this|century must not be selfish or timid if hope to have a decent world for child and grandchild simply must balance demand for energy with rapidly shrink resource by act now can control future instead of let the future control two|days|from|now will present to the congress energy proposal member will be partner and have already give a great deal of valuable advice many of these proposal will be unpopular some will cause to put up with inconvenience and to make sacrifice the most important thing about these proposal be that the alternative may be a national catastrophe further delay can affect strength and power as a nation decision about energy will test the character of the american people and the ability of the president and the congress to govern this nation this difficult effort will be the moral equivalent of war except that will be unite effort to build and not to destroy now know that some of may doubt that face real energy shortage the gas line be go and with this springtime weather home be warm again but energy problem be bad tonight than be in or a|few|weeks|ago in the dead of winter be bad because more waste have occur and more time have pass by without planning for the future and will get bad every|day until act the oil and natural gas that rely on for of energy be simply run out in spite of increase effort domestic production have be drop steadily at about|6|percent a year import have double in the|last|5|years nation 's economic and political independence be become increasingly vulnerable unless profound change be make to lower oil consumption now believe that early in the 's the world will be demand more oil than can produce the world now use about|60|million|barrel of oil a day and demand increase each|year about|5|percent this mean that just to stay even need the production of a new texas every|year an alaskan north slope every|9|month or a new every|3|year obviously this can not continue must look back into history to understand energy problem twice in the|last|several|hundred|year there have be a transition in the way people use energy the first be about|200|years|ago when change away from wood which have provide about|90|percent of all fuel to coal which be much more efficient this change become the basis of the|industrial|revolution the second change take place in this|century with the grow use of oil and natural gas be more convenient and cheap than coal and the supply seem to be almost without limit make possible the age of automobile and airplane travel nearly everyone who be alive today grow up during this period and have never know anything different because be now run out of gas and oil must prepare quickly for a third change to strict conservation and to the renew use of coal and to permanent renewable energy source like solar power the world have not prepare for the future during the 's people use twice as much oil as during the 's during the 's use twice as much as during the 's and in each of those|decade more oil be consume than in all of man 's previous history combine world consumption of oil be still go up if be possible to keep rise during the 's and 's by a year as have in the past could use up all the prove reserve of oil in the entire world by the|end|of|the|next|decade know that many of have suspect that some supply of oil and gas be be withhold from the market may be right but suspicion about the oil company can not change the fact that be run out of petroleum all of have hear about the large oil field on alaska 's north|slope in a|few|year when the|north|slope be produce fully total output will be just about equal to ' increase in own nation 's energy demand each new inventory of world oil reserve have be more disturbing than the last world oil production can probably keep go up for another|6|or|8|year but sometime in the 's can not go up any more demand will overtake production have no choice about that but do have a choice about how will spend the|next|few|year each american use the energy equivalent of of oil per person each year be the most wasteful nation on earth waste more energy than import with about the same standard of living use twice as much energy per person as do other country like germany japan and sweden choice of course be to continue do what have be do before can drift along for a|few|more|year consumption of oil would keep go up every|year car would continue to be too large and inefficient quarter of would carry only|one person the driver while public transportation system continue to decline can delay insulate home and will continue to lose about|50|percent of heat in waste can continue use scarce oil and natural gas to generate electricity and continue waste third of fuel value in the process if do not act then by will be use more energy than use today can not substantially increase domestic production so would need to import twice as much oil as do now supply will be uncertain the cost will keep go up six|years|ago pay for import oil last|year spend for import oil nearly|10 time as much and this|year may spend unless act will spend more|than|$550|billion for import oil by for every man woman and child in america along with that money that transport overseas will continue lose american job and become increasingly vulnerable to supply interruption now have a choice but if wait will constantly live in fear of embargo could endanger freedom as a sovereign nation to act in foreign affair within would not be able to import enough oil from any country at any acceptable price if wait and do not act then factory will not be able to keep people on the job with reduced supply of fuel too few of utility company will have switch to coal which be most abundant energy source will not be ready to keep transportation system run with small and more efficient car and a well network of bus train and public transportation will feel mount pressure to plunder the environment will have to have a crash program to build more nuclear plant strip and bum more coal and drill more offshore well than if begin to conserve right now inflation will soar production will go down people will lose job intense competition for oil will build up among nation and also among the different region within own country this have already start if fail to act soon will face an economic social and political crisis that will threaten free institution but still have another choice can begin to prepare right now can decide to act while there be still time that be the concept of the energy policy that will present on wednesday national energy plan be base on fundamental principle the first principle be that can have an effective and comprehensive energy policy only if the government take responsibility for and if the people understand the seriousness of the challenge and be willing to make sacrifice the second principle be that healthy economic growth must continue only by save energy can maintain standard of living and keep people at work an effective conservation program will create hundreds|of|thousand of new job the third principle be that must protect the environment energy problem have the same cause as environmental problem wasteful use of resource conservation help solve both problem at once the fourth principle be that must reduce vulnerability to potentially devastating embargo can protect from uncertain supply by reduce demand for oil by make the most of abundant resource such as coal and by develop a strategic petroleum reserve the fifth principle be that must be fair solution must ask equal sacrifice from every region every class of people and every interest group industry will have to do part to conserve just as consumer will the energy producer deserve fair treatment but will not let the oil company profiteer the sixth principle and the cornerstone of policy be to reduce demand through conservation emphasis on conservation be a clear difference between this plan and other which merely encourage crash production effort conservation be the quick cheap most practical source of energy conservation be the only way that can buy a barrel of oil for cost about|$13 to waste the seventh principle be that price should generally reflect the true replacement cost of energy be only cheat if make energy artificially cheap and use more than can really afford the eighth principle be that government policy must be predictable and certain both consumer and producer need policy can count on so can plan ahead this be reason that be work with the congress to create a new department|of|energy to replace more|than|50 different agency that now have some control over energy the ninth principle be that must conserve the fuel that be scarce and make the most of those that be plentiful can not continue to use oil and gas for of consumption as do now when only make up of domestic reserve need to shift to plentiful coal while take care to protect the environment and to apply strict safety standard to nuclear energy the tenth and last principle be that must start now to develop the new unconventional source of energy that will rely on in the|next|century now these principle have guide the development of the policy that will describe to and the congress on wednesday night energy plan will also include a number of specific goal to measure progress toward a stable energy system these be the goal that set for â€”to reduce the annual growth rate in energy demand to less|than|2|percent â€”to reduce gasoline consumption by below current level â€”to cut in half the portion of u.s. oil which be import â€” from a potential level of 16|million|barrels|to|6|million|barrel a day â€”to establish a strategic petroleum reserve of one|billion|barrels more than a supply â€”to increase coal production by about|two third to more than one|billion|tons a year â€”to|insulate|90|percent of american home and all new building â€”to use solar energy in more than house will monitor progress toward these|goals|year by year plan will call for strict conservation measure if fall behind can not tell that these measure will be easy nor will be popular but think most of realize that a policy which do not ask for change or sacrifice would not be an effective policy at this|late|date this plan be essential to protect job environment standard of living and future whether this plan truly make a difference will not be decide now here in washington but in every town and every factory in every home and on every highway and every farm believe that this can be a positive challenge there be something especially american in the kind of change that have to make have always be proud through history of be efficient people have always be proud of ingenuity skill at answer question now need efficiency and ingenuity more than ever have always be proud of leadership in the world and now have a chance again to give the world a positive example have always be proud of vision of the future have always want to give child and grandchild a world rich in possibility than have have be the one that must provide for now be the one who will suffer most if do not act have give some of the principle of the plan be sure that each of will find something do not like about the specific of proposal will demand that make sacrifice and change in every life to some degree the sacrifice will be painful but so be any meaningful sacrifice will lead to some high cost and to some great inconvenience for everyone but the sacrifice can be gradual realistic and be necessary above all will be fair no one will gain an unfair advantage through this plan no one will be ask to bear an unfair burden will monitor the accuracy of datum from the oil and natural gas company for the first time so that will always know true production supply reserve and profit those citizen who insist on drive large unnecessarily powerful car must expect to pay more for that luxury can be sure that all the special interest group in the country will attack the part of this plan that affect directly will say that sacrifice be fine as long as other people do but that sacrifice be unreasonable or unfair or harmful to the country if succeed with this approach then the burden on the ordinary citizen who be not organize into an interest group would be crush there should be only|one test for this program whether will help country other generation of americans have face and master great challenge have faith that meeting this challenge will make own life even rich if will join so that can work together with patriotism and courage will again prove that great nation can lead the world into an age of peace independence and freedom thank very much and good night view transcript transcript the president have brief statement to make and then will be glad to answer question have send to congress this morning a youth employment package which will consist of about|$1/2|billion part of the economic stimulus package have be particularly concern in own campaign trip around the country the|last|2|years with the extraordinarily high unemployment rate among young people the total unemployed be less|than|24|years|old and among those say from have over 18-percent unemployment and in some of the minority group in urban area more|than|40|percent so be go to try a heavy concentration of effort in several of the major department of government to cut down unemployment among young people have for instance a youth conservation corps similar to what have during the depression year know as a|civilian|conservation|corps the ccc this will be administer by the|departments|of|agriculture and interior in the open space of country will have a|youth|community|conservation|corps in the urban area and a heavy emphasis on training for young people lead to employment include exist program this will be about|a|million job on a permanent basis plus another job during the|summer hope that the congress will act quickly on this proposal may say that many of the members of congress have be equally concern and have do a great deal of work on this subject even before become president the other item that would like to mention be that be already be report to some degree have long be concern about own nation 's stance in prohibit american citizen to travel to foreign country also be quite eagerly assess own nation 's policy that violate human right as define by the helsinki agreement later on this|year will go to belgrade to assess the component part of the helsinki agreement and want to be sure that do not violate those right so have instruct the secretary of state to remove any travel restriction on american citizen who want to go to vietnam to north|korea to cuba and to cambodia and these restriction will be lift as of the|18th|day|of|march would like to point out that still do not have diplomatic relationship with these country that be a doubtful prospect at this time so there will be some necessary precaution that ought to be take by citizen who go there since do not have own diplomat in those country to protect if should have difficulty would be glad to answer any question that may have ms. thomas helen|thomas united|press international]. q. mr. president an american delegate to the|u.n.|human|rights|commission have say that believe and hope that allegation concern terror suffer in chile today coincide with human right policy do the president well do not know which delegate this be or what concern be but be still concerned about deprivation of human right in many of the country of the world think chile would be of those where concern have be express and want to be sure that the american people understand that this be a very sensitive issue have try to be broad base in expression of concern and also responsible at first policy be interpret think improperly to deal exclusively with the|soviet|union have just point out how own country have be at fault in some instance torture have be report to from some of the nation of the world be present these item to the congress as require by law but throughout the entire world in latin|america in own country in the communist nation in and in the|soviet|union be very much aware of the concern about human right think be entirely appropriate for own country to take the leadership role and let the world say that the focal point for the preservation and protection of human right be in be proud of this and intend to adhere to with the deep possible personal commitment and believe speak accurately for the american people on this subject q. well then do that mean mr. president that do not object to the remark that be make by delegate the president think that the remark make by the delegate concern past involvement in chilean political affair be inappropriate do not know about ahead of time be a personal expression of opinion by that delegate think that the church committee in the senate have not find any evidence that the|united|states be involve in the overthrow of the allende government in chile there be some allegation make think perhaps accurate that do have financial aid and other think financial aid to be restrictive to political element in chile that may have contribute to the change in government but do not think there have be any proof of illegality there and the statement make by delegate be own personal statement not represent government 's q. mr. president gather the youth employment program just announce be in addition to economic stimulus program and wonder how much money this add to the deficit in the upcome fiscal year the president no this be within the overall economic stimulus package already present to the congress q. mr. president there have be a lot of talk about defensible border lately and what that mean in regard to the|middle|east could ask sir do feel that would be appropriate in a middle|east peace settlement for the israelis to keep some of the occupy land take during the|1967|war in order to have secure border the president the defensible border phrase the secure border phrase obviously be just semantic think be a relatively significant development in the description of possible settlement in the|middle|east to talk about these thing as a distinction the recognize border have to be mutual the arab nation the israeli nation have to agree on permanent and recognize border where sovereignty be legal as mutually agree defense line may or may not conform in the foreseeable future to those legal border there may be extension of israeli defense capability beyond the permanent and recognize border think this distinction be that be now recognize by israeli leader the definition of border on a geographical basis be that remain to be determine but think that be important for the world to begin to see and for the interested party to begin to see that there can be a distinction between the the ability of israel to defend by international agreement or by the some time placement of israeli force or by monitoring station as have be the case in the sinai beyond the actual sovereignty border as mutually agree by israel and neighbor q. well do that mean international zone between the country the president international zone could very well be part of an agreement and think that can see in a grow way a step by step process where there may be a mutual agreement that the ultimate settlement even include the border delineation would be at a certain describe point in an interim state maybe or more there would be a mutual demonstration of friendship and an end to the declaration or state of war think that what israel would like to have be what would like to have a termination of belligerence toward israel by neighbor a recognition of israel 's right to exist the right to exist in peace the opening up of border with free trade tourist travel cultural exchange between israel and neighbor in other word a stabilization of the situation in the|middle|east without a constant threat to israel 's existence by neighbor this would involve substantial withdrawal of israel 's present control over territory now where that withdrawal may end do not know would guess would be some minor adjustment in the border but that still remain to be negotiate but think this be go to be a long tedious process be go to mount a major effort in own government in to bring the party to geneva obviously any agreement have to be between the party concern will act as an intermediary when good office will serve well but be not try to predispose own nation 's attitude towards what may be the ultimate detail of the agreement that can mean so much to world peace q. at the risk of oversimplification sir believe understand during the campaign propose a gradual withdrawal of american troop from korea the president yes q. yet after revise budget go to congress the army have go to congress and ask in fiscal|1978 for a doubling of military construction fund for korea and in the|3|ensuing|years for more|than|$110|million for similar construction how do that square with withdrawal plan the president commitment to withdraw american ground troop from korea have not change will be meet this|afternoon with the foreign minister of south|korea this will be of the matter that will discuss have also talk to general vessey who be in charge of armed|force in south|korea think that the time period as describe in the|campaign|months a time period be appropriate the schedule for withdrawal of american ground troop would have to be work out very carefully with the|south|korean|government would also have to be do with the full understanding and perhaps participation of japan would want to leave in place in south|korea adequate ground force own by and control by the|south|korean|government to protect against any intrusion from north|korea would envision a continuation of american air cover for south|korea over a long period of time but these be the basic element and be very determined that over a period of time as describe just then that ground troop would be withdraw q. mr. president would like to try to clarify the israeli situation if may a|moment|ago in answer the question speak of the possibility of substantial withdrawal of israeli control over territory and then just|a|few|seconds|later speak of the possibility of minor territorial concession by the israelis what be exactly that have in mind here be really talk about some big withdrawal or be talk only about minor withdrawal the president do not think would use the word minor withdrawal think there may be minor adjustment to the pre-1967 border but that be a matter for israel and neighbor to decide between believe that will know by would say the|middle|of|may much more clearly the position of the interested party have not yet meet nor talk to the leader in lebanon syria jordan egypt saudi|arabia to a less direct participation degree will meet with all these leader between now and the middle of may and do not want to try to define in any specific term the exact delineation of border but think this be obviously of the most serious problem there be basic element be an ultimate commitment to complete peace in the|middle|east second border determination which be highly controversial and not yet be define by either side and third deal with the palestinian question and be not try to act as the one to lay down an ultimate settlement do not know what an ultimate settlement will be but these matter will be freely and openly debate within own country and within the country involve and think have describe as good can own position q. mr. president the|department|of|housing|and|urban|development if read secretary harris correctly seem to be move towards a policy that would promote racial integration of the suburb namely through the withholding of water and sewer and community development grant in community that lack a positive commitment to low- and moderate income housing what be view on this the president well this be a subject that be well discuss during the campaign as remember think that the housing act believe be clearly describe a requirement that communitie that request federal help in establish housing have to put forward a positive proposal to ensure a mixture of housing in the entire community without regard to race and without regard to the economic level of the family involve this do not mean that every individual city block or suburban block have to have all different kind of housing in do mean that the overall package as propose to the|federal|government have to provide for a wide distribution of housing opportunity for those in minority group or those who have a low income and believe that secretary harris ' statement be compatible with that law requirement q. mr. president last|week in an interview express concern about the disclosure of confidential and classified information admiral turner choice to head the cia have say believe in testimony that would favor criminal penalty for disclosure by government official of that type of information but vice president mondale say be oppose to wonder sir if would tell where stand on that issue and what other than restrict access to classified information intend to do about this problem the president well own interest would be to minimize the use of any criminal penalty for disclosure of information there be other penalty that can be use without criminal charge and think that vice president mondale draw that distinction do not know yet what procedure will follow own hope would be that could prevent the disclosure of intelligence information that may be damaging to national security rather than try to control that problem by the imposition of legal criminal penalty q. could elaborate on how may prevent that mr. president the president well think first of all be a tight control over the number of people who have access to material that be highly sensitive that may damage the relationship between own country and friend and ally have already initiate step to that degree and will be pursue as know admiral turner have only recently be confirm be just now get presence feel in the defense community will be go out to the cia headquarters this|afternoon to see the oath of office administer to but will make sure that the public know what new policy impose but the one that be easy to describe and also very difficult to do be to make sure that do not have too many people know about matter that do not need to know and also that can protect the legitimate confidentiality of agreement between and ally now would never permit anything that be either illegal or improper and have get a very good arrangement that be primarily set up by president ford to prevent abuse the|intelligence|oversight|board be make up of distinguished man appoint by president ford who have complete access to any operation conduct by the intelligence force senator inouye 's committee in the senate and think committee in the house also have access to this information of course be monitor and think admiral turner 's integrity be also a guarantee that there will be no future abuse but that do not mean that everything that do in gather intelligence on which security may very well depend have to be reveal to the public and draw of that distinction be that be responsibility and think can handle that q. what effect in mind if any be the extent of debate in the senate over mr. warnke 's qualification to be the chief salt negotiator go to have eventually on negotiating position the president do not believe that the exact vote in the senate on mr. warnke 's confirmation will have a major effect on future negotiation with the|soviet|union on salt the obvious impression that concern be a demonstration of lack of confidence of the senate in own ability and attitude as a chief negotiator obviously as president any decision make with the russians on reduction of atomic weapon would have to be approve by have promise the|joint|chiefs|of|staff who in the past perhaps have be bypass in the process that will always know ahead of time what position will be at the negotiating table have not promise the|joint|chiefs|of|staff that would have the right to approve or disapprove every individual item in negotiation but hope that the senate will give mr. warnke a strong vote think many of the people that oppose mr. warnke just do not want to see any substantial reduction in atomic weapon even though be agree to mutually by and the|soviet|union or even if be design to reduce the threat of nuclear destruction of the world feel very deeply that ought to pursue with every possible mean an agreement with the|soviet|union for substantial reduction in atomic weapon think mr. warnke agree most of the senators agree so there be a wide range of reason for not vote for mr. warnke have complete confidence in and may say there be more very significant guard against any error that and mr. warnke and the secretary of state and other may make the senate have to approve by a third vote after complete open debate any agreement sign with the|soviet|union so think that the attack on mr. warnke be primarily by those who do not want to see substantial reduction in nuclear weapon in the world q. be widely report that a grand jury in washington may be investigate richard|helms the former cia director to see whether to move forward on a case be report that perhaps the jury will want to see certain cia document and presume would be the final arbiter have be ask for those document and what will be policy if be ask for in this case or any other case the president have not be ask for any document and the helms case have not come to attention either officially or even indirectly from any of the people involve whether or not to proceed with the case will be the exclusive right of the|justice|department the revelation of any document that affect national security will be own judgment in this or other case can not respond any further than that because that be all know about the subject q. mr. president if may say sir the problem as know relate to guess national security consideration on the hand and the legal system and justice on the other give the recent history just wonder how closely will weigh those the president well the prosecution of the case have nothing to do with that will be a judgment make by the|justice|department the actual revelation to a grand jury or in case of a trial if should ever evolve of confidential or secret material would have to be judge by q. that would control sir would not whether the prosecution could go forward even if choose the president may or may not at that point the responsibility for make a judgment and the responsibility for the consequence of an inaccurate judgment if should occur would be own q. mr. president in connection with concern about human right a task force on terrorism and violence last|week present a report to attorney general bell regard recommendation have to make on how should handle civil disorder should occur again like do in the sixty be a report fund the study be fund by the leaa and attorney general bell typify this as of the good thing the leaa be do well sir in the report there be certain recommendation such as the use of mass arrest the use of preventive detention some of the very thing that be use in the|sixty and later rule inappropriate by the court and wonder sir what feel about this problem involve human right in the|united|state the president would be oppose to mass arrest and would be oppose to preventive detention as a general policy and even as a specific policy unless be an extreme case obviously in a report there would be thing with which would agree and thing with which would disagree have not see the report be not familiar with but think the abuse in the past have in many case exacerbate the disharmony that bring about demonstration and think the arrest of large number of people without warrant or preventive detention be contrary to own good system of government q. mr. president to follow on mr. donaldson 's sam|donaldson question on the helms case ask if document have be request the president have not q. say have not mr. lipshutz general counsel indicate to some reporter last|week however that the matter of decision on release of information be in the|white|house be in office and that would make ultimately up to now have the|justice|department not ask permission to declassify document that may have get from other source from other department of the government in this case the president if have ask for have not come to attention can not say that somewhere in the pipeline from the|justice|department the|state|department the cia or even own counsel that request have be make but have not be aware of q. be question concern mr. lipshutz 's statement communicate to last|friday after some briefing in the|white|house the president have not receive any request from mr. lipshutz obviously when something get to the|white|house take time for to staff and give the option have to address and since be not an attorney to give some opinion on the legality of but have not come to attention at all q. can not say whether have in office the president do not know q. mr. president understand that have agree to speak on the telephone to the man in ohio who be hold a police official hostage after release be concerned that this may be regard as a precedent the president yes be q. what be the factor that weigh in that regard the president the request be make to to talk to mr. moore as a precondition for release the police officer who now have be hold about|24|hour reply that would be glad to talk to mr. moore after the police officer be release be perhaps a dangerous precedent to establish weigh that factor before make own decision understand that mr. moore have promise to release the police officer after this news conference regardless of any comment that may make on and hope that the police officer will be release but if should be release will talk to mr. moore q. mr. president would like to go just a little bit further in discussion of the defensible border issue if understand correctly be talk about the possibility of something like an israeli defense line along and perhaps at some point on and perhaps at some point on the|golan|height that would be defense force but not legal border have understand that correctly that feeling be that the israelis be go to have to have some kind of defense force along and in those other place the president well add a great deal to what say in the first place do not mention any particular part of the geography around israel and do not confine the defense capability to israeli force these may very well be international force may very well be a line that be fairly broad say or more where demilitarization be guarantee on both side may very well consist of outpost electronic or perhaps personnel outpost as be establish in the sinai region as a result of the egypt and israeli agreement be not go to try to get more specific in say what will or will not be the case but that be a possibility that may lead to the alleviation of tension there and be about which will be discuss this matter with the representative from the arab country when come q. mr. president mr. schlesinger recently tell the senate committee that april|20th energy policy recommendation will emphasize a switch from oil and gas to coal but stop short of say that will support mandatory exclusion of oil and gas as boiler fuel what be position on that the president have not address that question yet how to encourage or perhaps even to force the end of waste natural gas just for the generation of heat at central power plant station be something that will have to address may be do by legislation may be do by economic penalty may be do by an appeal to the stationary heat producer to shift on a patriotic basis can not yet say which of the proposal will be mandatory and which will be voluntary q. on several occasion mr. president have speak in term of the u.s. be ready to move to a quick salt agreement omit cruise missile backfire bomber if necessary be wonder sir have have any indication yet of russian intention on this subject the president the|soviet|union so far as know still would like to include the cruise missile question in the present negotiation do not want to discuss backfire bomber at all and hope have be and be that by the exclusion of both those controversial item which will require long and tedious negotiation that may move to a rapid agreement at salt|ii and immediately begin to discuss for instance the backfire bomber the cruise missile in subsequent negotiation but do not have any indication yet that the soviets have change position on that issue q. mr. president what about nuclear reduction the president again think have approach to the question have propose both directly and indirectly to the|soviet|union publicly and privately that try to identify those item on which there be relatively close agreement not completely yet because detail be very difficult on occasion but have for instance suggest that forgo the opportunity to arm satellite body and also to forgo the opportunity to destroy observation satellite have also propose that the|indian|ocean be completely demilitarize that a comprehensive test ban be put into effect that prior notification of test missile launching be exchange and would like to see any of these item on which the soviets will agree quickly be conclude and then get down to the much more difficult negotiation on much more drastic overall commitment to atomic weapon lead ultimately to the complete elimination of atomic weapon from the face of the earth this be go to be a long slow tedious process but think if and the soviets could agree on the easy item and none of be very easy quickly would show good faith think would let the world know that be serious in stop once and for all what have be a continuous and rapid escalation in atomic weapon capability since be first evolve frank cormier associated press]. thank mr. president the president thank very much view transcript transcript good evening tomorrow will be two|week since become president have spend a lot of time decide how can be a good president this talk which the broadcast network have agree to bring to be of several step that will take to keep in close touch with the people of country and to let know informally about plan for the|coming|months when be run for president make a number of commitment take very seriously believe that be the reason that be elect and want to know that intend to carry out as probably notice already have act on several of promise will report to from time to time about government both problem and achievement but tonight want to tell how plan to carry out some of other commitment some of obvious goal can be achieve very quickly for example through executive order and decision make directly by but in many other area must move carefully with full involvement by the congress allow time for citizen to participate in careful study in order to develop predictable long range program that can be sure be affordable and that know will work some of these effort will also require dedication perhaps even some sacrifice from but do not believe that any of be afraid to learn that national goal require cooperation and mutual effort of most urgent project be to develop a national energy policy as point out during the campaign the|united|state be the only major industrial country without a comprehensive long range energy policy the extremely cold weather this|winter have dangerously deplete supply of natural gas and fuel oil and force hundreds|of|thousand of worker off the job congratulate the congress for quick action on the emergency natural gas act which be pass today and sign just|a|few|minutes|ago but the real problem failure to plan for the future or to take energy conservation seriously start long before this|winter and will take much long to solve realize that many of have not believe that really have an energy problem but this|winter have make all of realize that have to act now the congress have already make many of the preparation for energy legislation presidential assistant dr. james|schlesinger be begin to direct an effort to develop a national energy policy many group of americans will be involve on april|20 will have complete the planning for energy program and will immediately then ask the congress for help in enact comprehensive legislation program will emphasize conservation the amount of energy being waste which could be save be great than the total energy that be import from foreign country will also stress development of rich coal reserve in an environmentally sound way will emphasize research on solar energy and other renewable energy source and will maintain strict safeguard on necessary atomic energy production the responsibility for set energy policy be now split among more|than|50 different agency department and bureaus in later|this|month will ask the congress for help in combine many of these agency in a new energy department to bring order out of chaos congressional leader have already be work on this for quite a while must face the fact that the energy shortage be permanent there be no way can solve quickly but if all cooperate and make modest sacrifice if learn to live thriftily and remember the importance of help neighbor then can find way to adjust and to make society more efficient and own life more enjoyable and productive utility company must promote conservation and not consumption oil and natural gas company must be honest with all of about reserve and profit will find out the difference between real shortage and artificial one will ask private company to sacrifice just as private citizen must do all of must learn to waste less energy simply by keep thermostat for instance at in the daytime and at night could save half the current shortage of natural gas there be no way that or anyone else in the government can solve energy problem if be not willing to help know that can meet this energy challenge if the burden be bear fairly among all people and if realize that in order to solve energy problem need not sacrifice the quality of life the congress have make great progress toward responsible strip mining legislation so that can produce more energy without unnecessary destruction of beautiful land administration will support these effort this|year will also ask congress for help with legislation which will reduce the risk of future oil tanker spill and help deal with those that do occur also state during campaign that administration would do everything possible to restore a healthy american economy nation be build on the principle of work and not welfare productivity and not stagnation but take office a|couple|of|weeks|ago in the middle of the bad economic slowdown of the|last|40|years more|than|7|1/2|million|people who want to work can not find accord to the late statistic because of high unemployment and idle factory the average american family like your have be lose a year in income and many billions|of|dollar have be add to the federal deficit also inflation hurt all in every part of the country whether have a job or whether be look for a job must race just to keep up with the constant rise in price inflation have hit hardest not in luxury but in the essential food energy health housing see every time go shop understand that unemployment and inflation be very real and have do great harm to many american family nothing make hard to provide decent health housing and education for people protect environment or to realize goal of a balanced budget than a stagnant economy as soon as be elect the leader of the congress and own adviser begin to work with to develop a proposal for economic recovery be guide by the principle that everyone who be able to work ought to work that economic strength be base on a healthy productive private business sector that must provide the great help to those with the great need and that there must be a predictable and a steady growth in economy two|days|ago present this plan to the congress be a balanced plan with many clement to meet the many cause of economic problem element that be sure will like be reduce taxis this|year the time tax benefit to the average family of with in income will be 30-percent reduction in income taxis but primary concern be still job and these time tax rebate be the only quick effective way to get money into the economy and create those job but at the same time be reduce taxis permanently by increase the standard deduction which most taxpayer claim again this family of earn will save on a permanent basis about|20|percent on future income taxis this will also be a major step toward tax simplification allow of all taxpayer to take the standard deduction and to file a very simple tax return quite different from the one that will file this|year will also provide tax incentive to business firm to encourage to fight inflation by expand output and to hire more of people who be eager to work think make more sense for the government to help worker stay on the payroll than to force onto unemployment benefit or welfare payment have several proposal too in this legislation to help city which have be especially hard hit by nationwide economic problem community where unemployment be bad will be eligible for additional money through the revenue sharing program a special program of public service employment will enable those who be now unemployed to contribute to community in hospital nursing home park and recreation program and other related activity a strong public work program will permit the construction of select project which be need most these will not be make work project will be especially valuable in community where budget cutback have reduce municipal service and will also help to prevent local tax increase now because unemployment be most severe among special group of people the young the disabled minority group will focus training program on the top priority in job training program will go to young veteran of the vietnam war unemployment be much high among veteran than among other of the same age who do not serve in the military hope that put many thousand of veteran back to work will be more step toward bind up the wound of the|war|year and toward help those who have help country in the past realize that very few people will think that this total economic plan be perfect many group would like to see more of kind of aid and less of another but be confident that this be the good balanced plan that can produce for the overall economic health of the nation will produce steady balanced sustainable growth do not ignore inflation to solve unemployment or vice versa do not ask group of people to sacrifice solely for the benefit of another group ask all of to contribute participate and share to get the country back on the road to work again be an excellent investment in the future also say many time during the campaign that must reform and reorganize the|federal|government have often use the phrase competent and compassionate to describe what government should be when the government must perform a function should do efficiently wherever free competition would do a well job of serve the public the government should stay out ordinary people should be able to understand how own government work and to get satisfactory answer to question confused and wasteful system that take so long to grow will take a long time to change the place to start be at the top in the|white|house be reduce the size of the white|house staff by nearly|one third and have ask the member of the cabinet to do the same at top staff level soon will put a ceiling on the number of people employ by the federal|government agency so can bring the growth of government under control be now review the government 's advisory committee and commission to see how many could be abolish without harm to the public have eliminate some expensive and unnecessary luxury such as door to door limousine service for many top official include all member of the white|house staff government official can not be sensitive to problem if be live like royalty here in washington while be deeply grateful for the good wish that lie behind would like to ask that people not send gift to or to family or to anyone else who serve in administration will cut down also on government regulation and will make sure that those that be write be in plain english for a change whenever a regulation be issue will carry author 's name and will request the cabinet member to read all regulation personally before be release this|week will ask the congress for enable legislation to let reorganize the government the passage of this legislation which will give the same authority extend to every president from franklin|roosevelt through richard|nixon and use by many governors across the country be absolutely crucial to a successful reorganization effort so far news from the congress because of support be very encouraging the|office|of|management|and|budget be now work on this plan which will include base budgeting removal of unnecessary government regulation sunset law to cancel program that have outlive purpose and elimination of overlap and duplication among government service will not propose change until have do good to be sure be right but will be eager to learn from experience if a program do not work will end instead of just start another to conceal first mistake will also move quickly to reform tax system and welfare system say in the campaign that income tax system be a disgrace because be so arbitrary complicated and unfair make a commitment to a total overhaul of the income tax law the economic program that have already mention earlier will by enable more taxpayer to use the standard deduction be just a first step toward a much well tax system adviser have already start work with the congress on a study of a more complete tax reform which will give a fairer simple system will outline the study procedure very soon and after consultation with many american citizen and with the congress will present a comprehensive tax reform package before the welfare system also need a complete overhaul welfare waste rob both the taxpayer of country and those who really and genuinely need help often force family to split discourage people from seek work the secretary of labor and the secretary of health,|education and welfare and other have already begin a review of the entire welfare system will of course work with the congress to develop proposal for a new system which will minimize abuse strengthen the family and emphasize adequate support for those who can not work and training and job for those who can work expect first report to be ready within in the meantime will support the congress in effort to deal with the widespread fraud and waste and abuse of medicaid

service be deliver there be many other area of domestic policy housing health crime education agriculture and other that will concern as president but which do not have time to discuss tonight all of

develop that would do more good than voluntary conservation there be no economic policy that will do as much as share faith in hard work efficiency and in the future of system know that both the congress and the administration as partner in leadership have limit power that be the way ought to be but in the|month in which have campaign prepare to take office and now begin to serve as president have find a reason for optimism with the help of predecessor have come through a very difficult period in nation 's history but for almost|10|year have not have a sense of a common national interest

when feel a different spirit during world|war|ii face a terrible crisis but the challenge of fight nazism draw together those of old enough to remember know that be dark and frightening time but many of memory be of people ready to help each other for the common good believe that be ready for that same spirit again â€” to plan ahead to work together and to use common sense not because of war but

but can promise that need will never be ignore nor will forget who put in office will always be a nation of difference business and labor black and white man and woman people of different region and religion and different ethnic background â€” but with faith and confidence in each other difference can be a source of personal fullness and national strength rather than a cause of weakness and

remain of the most serious problem face citizen have have some success and there have be some disappointment bluntly must remind that have not make satisfactory progress toward achieve energy independence energy be absolutely vital to the defense of country to the strength of economy and to the quality of life two|years|ago propose to the congress the first comprehensive national energy program a specific and coordinated set of measure that would end vulnerability to embargo blockade or arbitrary price increase and would mobilize u.s. technology and resource to supply a significant share of the free world 's energy after of the major energy proposal submit two|years|ago only|half belatedly become law in be dependent upon foreign oil import for of need today be dependent and will pay out for foreign oil this|year such vulnerability at present or in the future be intolerable and must be end the answer to where stand on national energy effort today remind of the old argument about whether the tank be half|full|or|half empty the pessimist will say have half fail to achieve 10-year energy goal the optimist will say that have half succeed be always an optimist but must make up for lose time have lay a solid foundation for complete the enormous task which confront have sign into law major energy bill which contain significant measure for conservation resource development stockpiling and standby authority have move forward to develop the naval petroleum reserve to build a barrel strategic petroleum stockpile to phase out unnecessary government allocation and price control to develop a lasting relationship with other oil consume nation to improve the efficiency of energy use through conservation in automobile building and industry and to expand research on new technology and renewable resource such as wind power geothermal and solar energy all these action significant as be for the long term be only the beginning recently submit to the congress proposal to reorganize the federal energy structure and the hard choice which remain if be serious about reduce dependence upon foreign energy these include program to reverse decline production of natural gas and increase incentive for domestic crude oil production propose to minimize environmental uncertainty affect coal development expand nuclear power generation and create an energy independence authority to provide government financial assistance for vital energy program where private capital be not available must explore every reasonable prospect for meet energy need when current domestic reserve of oil and natural gas begin to dwindle in the|next|decade urgently ask congress and the new administration to move quickly on these issue this nation have the resource and the capability to achieve energy goal if government have the will to proceed and think do have be disappoint by inability to complete many of the meaningful organizational reform which contemplate for the federal government although a start have be make for example the federal judicial system have long serve as a modal for other court but today be threaten by a shortage of qualified federal judge and an explosion of litigation claim federal jurisdiction commend to the new administration and the congress the recent report and recommendation of the|department|of|justice undertake at request on the need of the federal court especially endorse proposal for a new commission on the judicial appointment process while the judicial branch of government may require reinforcement the budget and payroll of the other branch remain staggering can not help but observe that while the white|house staff and the|executive|office of the president have be reduce and the total number of civilian in the executive branch contain during the|1970s the legislative branch have increase substantially although the membership of the congress remain at congress now cost the taxpayer per member the whole legislative budget have pass the billion|dollar|mark set out to reduce the growth in the size and spending of the federal government but no president can accomplish this alone the congress sidetrack most of request for authority to consolidate overlapping program and agency to return more decisionmaking and responsibility to state and local government through block grant instead of rigid categorical program and to eliminate unnecessary red tape and outrageously complex regulation have make some progress in cut back the expansion of government and intrusion into individual life but believe there be much more to be do and and know can only be do by tough and temporarily painful surgery by a congress as prepare as the president to face up to this very real political problem again wish successor work with a substantial majority of own party the good of success in reform the costly and cumbersome machinery of the federal government the task of self government be never finish the problem be great the opportunity be great america 's first goal be and always will be peace with honor america must remain first in keep peace in the world can remain first in peace only if be never second in defense in present the state of the union to the congress and to the american people have a special obligation as commander in chief to report on national defense survival as a free and independent people require above all strong military force that be well equipped and highly train to perform assign mission be particularly gratify to report that over the|past|two|year have be able to reverse the dangerous decline of the|previous|decade in real resource this country be devote to national defense this be an immediate problem face in the evidence be unmistakable that the|soviet|union have be steadily increase the resource apply to build military strength during this same period the united|stat real defense spending decline in budget not only arrest that dangerous decline but have establish the positive trend which be essential to ability to contribute to peace and stability in the world the|vietnam|war both materially and psychologically affect overall defense posture the dangerous anti - military sentiment discourage defense spending and unfairly disparage the man and woman who serve in armed force the challenge that now confront this country be whether have the national will and determination to continue this essential defense effort over the long term as must be continue can no longer afford to oscillate from year to year in so vital a matter indeed have a duty to look beyond the immediate question of budget and to examine the nature of the problem will face over the next generation be the first recent president able to address long term basic issue without the burden of vietnam the war in indochina consume enormous resource at the very time that the overwhelming strategic superiority once enjoy be disappear in past|years as a result of decision by the|united|state strategic force level off yet the|soviet|union continue a steady constant buildup of own force commit a high percentage of national economic effort to defense the|united|state can never tolerate a shift in strategic balance against or even a situation where the american people or ally believe the balance be shift against the|united|state would risk the most serious political consequence if the world come to believe that adversary have a decisive margin of superiority to maintain a strategic balance must look ahead to the|1980s and beyond the sophistication of modern weapon require that make decision now if be to ensure security therefore have consistently advocate and strongly urge that pursue critical strategic program the trident missile launch submarine the b-1 bomber with superior capability to penetrate modern air defense and a more advanced intercontinental ballistic missile that will be better able to survive nuclear attack and deliver a devastating retaliatory strike in an era where the strategic nuclear force be in rough equilibrium the risk of conflict below the nuclear threshold may grow more perilous a major long term objective therefore be to maintain capability to deal with and thereby deter conventional challenge and crisis particularly in europe can not rely solely on strategic force to guarantee security or to deter all type of aggression must have superior naval and marine force to maintain freedom of the sea strong multipurpose tactical air force and mobile modern ground force accordingly have direct a long term effort to improve worldwide capability to deal with regional crisis have submit a year naval building program indispensable to the nation 's maritime strategy because the security of europe and the integrity of nato remain the cornerstone of american defense policy have initiate a special long term program to ensure the capacity of the alliance to deter or defeat aggression in europe as leave office can report that national defense be effectively deter conflict today armed force be capable of carry out the variety of mission assign to program be underway which will assure can deter war in the|years|ahead but also must warn that will require a sustained effort over a|period|of|year to maintain these capability must have the wisdom the stamina and the courage to prepare today for the peril of tomorrow and believe will as look to the future and assure intend to go on do that for a good many year can say with confidence that the state of the union be good but must go on make better

moderator of the last of the debate of between gerald|r.|ford republican candidate for president and jimmy|carter democratic candidate for president welcome president ford welcome governor carter and thank for join this|evening this debate take place before an audience in phi|beta|kappa|memorial|hall on the campus of the|college|of|william|and|mary|in historic williamsburg virginia be particularly appropriate in this|bicentennial|year that meet on these ground to hear this debate two|hundred|years|ago william and mary student meet at nearby raleigh|tavern to form a fraternity design write to search out and dispel the cloud of falsehood by debate without reserve the issue of the|day in that spirit of debate--"without reserve to dispel the cloud of falsehood"--gentlemen let proceed the subject matter of this debate be open cover all issue and topic questioner tonight be joseph|kraft syndicate columnist robert|maynard editorial writer for the|washington|post and jack|nelson washington bureau chief of the|los|angeles|times the ground rule tonight be as follow questioners will alternate question between the candidate the candidate have up|to|2|1/2|minute to answer the question the other candidate then have up|to|2|minute to respond if necessary a questioner may ask a follow up question for further clarification and in that case the candidate have up|to|2|minute to respond as be initially agree to by both candidate the answer should be responsive to the particular question finally each candidate have up|to|3|minute for a close statement president ford and governor carter do not have prepare note or comment with this|evening but may make note and refer to during the debate have be determine that president ford would take the first question in this last debate and mr. kraft have that first question for president ford mr kraft mr. president assume that the americans all know that these be difficult time and that there be no pie in the sky and that do not expect something for nothing so would like to ask as a first question as look ahead in the|next|4|years what sacrifice be go to call on the american people to make what price be go to ask to pay to realize objective let add governor carter that if feel that be appropriate to answer that question in comment as to what price would be appropriate for the american people to pay for a carter administration think that would be proper too mr. president the president mr. kraft believe that the american people in the|next|4|years under a ford administration will be call upon to make those necessary sacrifice to preserve the peace which have which mean of course that will have to maintain an adequate military capability which mean of course that will have to add think a|few|billion|dollar to defense appropriation to make certain that have adequate strategic force adequate conventional force think the american people will be call upon to be in the forefront in give leadership to the solution of those problem that must be solve in the|middle|east in southern africa and any problem that may arise in the pacific the american people will be call upon to tighten belt a bit in meet some of the problem that face domestically do not think that america can go on a big spending spree with a whole lot of new program that would add significantly to the federal budget believe that the american people if give the leadership that would expect to give would be willing to give this thrust to preserve the peace and the necessary restraint at home to hold the lid on spending so that could think have a long overdue and totally justified tax decrease for the middle income people and then with the economy that would be generate from a restraint on spending and a tax reduction primarily for the middle income people then think the american people would be willing to make those sacrifice for peace and prosperity in the|next|4|years mr kraft could be a little bit more specific mr. president the president sure sure mr kraft do not policy really imply that be go to have to have a pretty high rate of unemployment over a fairly long time that growth be go to be fairly slow and that be not go to be able to do very much in the|next|4|or|5|year to meet the basic agenda of national need in the city in health in transit and a whole lot of other thing like that the president not at all mr kraft be not those the real cost the president no mr. kraft be spend very significant amount of money now some|$200|billion a year almost|50|percent of total federal expenditure by the|federal|government at the present time for human need now will probably have to increase that to some extent but do not have to have growth in spending that will blow the lid off and add to the problem of inflation believe can meet the problem within the city of this country and still give a tax reduction propose as know a reduction to increase the personal exemption from with the fiscal program that have and if look at the projection show that will reduce unemployment that will continue to win the battle against inflation and at the same time give the kind of quality of life that believe be possible in america a job a home for all those that will work and save for safety in the street health care that be affordable these thing can be do if have the right vision and the right restraint and the right leadership the moderator thank governor carter response please mr carter well may say first of all that think in case of a carter administration the sacrifice would be much less mr. ford 's own environmental agency have project a 10-percent unemployment rate by if be be president the american people be ready to make sacrifice if be part of the process if know that will be help to make decision and will not be exclude from be an involved party to the national purpose the major effort that must put forward be to put people back to work and think that this be example where a lot of people have selfish grasp idea now remember in in the depth of the energy crisis when president nixon call on the american people to make a sacrifice to cut down on the waste of gasoline to cut down on the speed of automobile be a tremendous surge of patriotism want to make a sacrifice for country think could call together with strong leadership in the|white|house business industry and labor and say let have voluntary price restraint let lay down some guideline so do not have continue inflation could also have an end to the extreme now have extreme for instance of some welfare recipient who by take advantage of the welfare law the housing law the medicaid law and the food stamp law make over a year and do not have to pay any taxis on at the other extreme just|i|percent of the rich people in country derive of all the tax benefit so both those extreme grasp for advantage and the person who have to pay that expense be the middle income family who be still work for a living and have to pay for the rich who have the privilege and for the poor who be not work but think that a balance approach with everybody be part of and strive for unselfishness could help as do in to let people sacrifice for own country know be ready for think the american people be too the moderator thank mr. maynard question to governor carter mr maynard governor by all indication the voter be so turn off by this election campaign so far that only|half intend to vote major reason for this apathetic electorate appear to be the low level at which this campaign bas be conduct have digress frequently from important issue into allegation of blunder and brainwashing and fixation on lust in playboy what responsibility do accept for the low level of this campaign for the nation 's high office mr carter think the major reason for a decrease in participation that have experience ever since ba be the deep discouragement of the american people about the performance of public official when have get people out of work when have get time as much inflation as have during the last democratic administration when have the high deficit in history when have become increasingly difficult for a family to put a child through college or to own a home there be a natural inclination to be turn off also in the aftermath of vietnam and cambodia and watergate and the cia revelation people have feel that have be betray by public official have to admit that in the heat of the campaign i've be in primary during the springtime have be campaign for i've make some mistake and think this be part of just be a human being have to say that campaign have be an open the playboy thing bas be of very great concern to do not know how to deal with exactly agree to give the interview to playboy other people have do who be notable governor jerry|brown walter|cronkite albert|schweitzer mr. ford 's own secretary of treasury mr. simon william|buckley many other people but be not run for president and in retrospect from hindsight would not have give that interview have to do over again if should ever decide in the future to discuss deep christian belief and condemnation and sinfulness l would use another forum besides playboy but can say this be do the good can to get away from that and during the|next|10|day the american people will not see the carter campaign run television advertisement or newspaper advertisement base on a personal attack on president ford 's character believe that the opposite be true with president ford 's campaign and hope that can leave those issue in the|next|10|days about personality and mistake of the past we've both matte some mistake and talk about unemployment inflation housing education taxation government organization strip away of secrecy and the thing that be crucial to the american people regret the thing in own long campaign that have be mistake but be try to do away with those the|last|10|day the moderator thank governor carter president ford response the president believe that the american people have be turn off in this election mr. maynard for a variety of reason have see on capitol|hill in the congress a great many allegation of wrongdoing of alleged immorality those be very disturbing to the american people wonder how an elect representative can serve and participate in such activity serve in the|congress|of|the|united|state yes and be certain many many americans be turn off by the revelation of watergate a very very bad period of time in american political history yes and thousand maybe million of americans be turn off because of the problem that come out of involvement in vietnam but on the other hand find on july|4|of|this|year a new spirit bear in america be celebrate bicentennial and find that there be a movement as travel around the country of great interest in this campaign now like any hard work person seek public office in the campaign inevitably sometimes will use rather graphic language and be guilty of that just like think most other in the political arena but do make a pledge that in the|next|10|day when be ask the american people to make of the most important decision in lifetime because think this election be of the most vital in the history of america that do together what can to stimulate voter participation the moderator thank president ford mr. nelson question to president ford mr nelson mr. president mention watergate and become president because of watergate so do not owe the american people a special obligation to explain in detail role of limit of the original investigation of a watergate that be the by the|house|banking|committee and know have answer question on this before but there be question that still remain and think people want to know what role be will name the person talk to in connection with that investigation and since say have no recollection of talk to anyone from the|white|house would be willing to open for examination the white|house tape of conversation during that period the president mr. nelson testify before committee house and senate on precisely the question that have ask and the testimony under oath be to the effect that do not talk to mr. nixon to mr. haldeman to mr. ehrlichman or to any of the people at the|white|house say have no recollection whatsoever of talk with any of the white|house legislative liaison people indicate under oath that the initiative that take be at the request of the rank member of the|house|banking|and|currency|committee on the republican side which be a legitimate request and a proper response by now that be go into by congressional committee and follow that investigation both committee overwhelmingly approve and both the house and the senate do likewise now in the meantime the special prosecutor within the|last|few|day after an investigation say there be no reason for to get involve because find nothing that would justify and then just a day or two|ago the attorney general of the|united|state make a further investigation and come to precisely the same conclusion now after all of those investigation by objective responsible people think the matter be close once and for all but to add other feature do not control any of the tape those tape be in the jurisdiction of the court and have no right to say yes or no but all the committee the attorney general the|special|prosecutor all of have give a clean bill of health think the matter be settle once and for all mr nelson well mr. president if do say so though the question be that think still have not go into detail about what role in be and do not think there be any question about whether or not there be a criminal prosecution but whether have tell the american people entire involvement in and whether would be willing even though do not control the tape whether would be willing to ask that the tape be release for examination the president that be for the proper authority who have control over those tape to make that decision have give every bit of evidence answer every question that be be ask by any senator or any member of the house plus the fact that the special prosecutor on own initiation and the attorney general on initiation the high law enforcement official in this country all of have give a clean bill of health and have tell everything know about think the matter be settle once and for all the moderator governor carter response mr carter do not have any response the moderator thank then will have the next question from mr. kraft to governor carter mr kraft governor carter the next big crisis spot in the world may be yugoslavia president tito be old and sick and there be division in country be pretty certain that the russians be go to do everything possibly can after tito die to force yugoslavia back into the soviet camp but last|saturday say and this be a quote--"i would not go to war in yugoslavia even if the|soviet|union send in troop do not that statement practically invite the russians to intervene in yugoslavia do not discourage yugoslavs who may be tempt to resist and would not have be wise on part to say nothing and to keep the russians in the dark as president ford do and as think every president have do since president truman mr carter in the|last|2|weeks have have a chance to talk to man who have visit the|soviet|union yugoslavia and china be governor averell|harriman,1 who visit the|soviet|union and yugoslavia and the other one be whom think accompany to china get a complete report back from those country from these distinguished gentleman governor of new|york and ambassador at large|1961 of defense mr. harriman talk to the leader in yugoslavia and think be accurate to say that there be no prospect in opinion of the|soviet|union invade yugoslavia should mr. tito pass away the present leadership there be fairly uniform in purpose think be a close knit group and think would be unwise for to say that will go to war in yugoslavia if the soviets should invade which think would be an extremely unlikely thing have maintain from the very beginning of campaign and this be a standard answer that make in response to the yugoslavian question that would never go to war become militarily involved in the internal affair of another country unless own security be directly threaten and do not believe that security would be directly threaten if the|soviet|union go into yugoslavia do not believe will happen certainly hope will not would take the strong possible measure short of actual military action there by own troop but doubt that that would be an eventuality mr kraft quick follow up do clear the response make with secretary schlesinger and governor harriman mr carter no do not the moderator president ford response the president well firmly believe mr. kraft that be unwise for a president to signal in advance what option may exercise if any international problem arise think all recall with some sadness that at the period of the late 's early 's there be some indication that the|united|states would not include south|korea in an area of defense there be some who allege can not prove true or untrue that such a statement in effect invite the|north|korean to invade be a fact do but no president of the|united|state in opinion should signal in advance to a prospective enemy what decision may be or what option may exercise be far well for a person sit in the|white|house who have a number of option to make certain that the other side so to speak do not know precisely what be go to do and therefore that be the reason that would not identify any particular course of action when respond to a question a|week|or|so|ago the moderator thank mr. maynard question to president ford please mr maynard sir this question concern administrative performance as president the other day general george|brown the chairman of the|joint|chiefs|of|staff deliver view on several sensitive subject among great|britain of this country 's old ally say and quote now be a pathetic thing just make cry be no longer a world power all have be general admiral and band since general brown 's comment have cause this country embarrassment in the past why be still this nation 's lead military officer the president have indicate to general|brown that the word that use in that interview in that particular case and in several other be very ill advise and general brown have indicate apology regret and think that will in this situation settle the matter be tragic that the full transcript of that interview be not release and that there be excerpt some of the excerpt take out of context not this one however that bring up general brown have an exemplary record of military performance serve this nation with great great skill and courage and bravery for and think be the consensus of the people who be knowledgeable in the military field that be probably the outstanding military leader and strategist that have in america today now do use ill advise word but think in the fact that apologize that be reprimand do permit to stay on and continue that kind of leadership that so badly need as enter into negotiation under the salt ii agreement or if have operation that may be develop in the|middle|east or in southern africa or in the pacific need a man with that experience that knowledge that know how and think in light of the fact that have apologize would not have justify asking for resignation the moderator thank governor carter response mr carter well just briefly think this be the second time that general|brown have make a statement for which do have to apologize and know that everybody make mistake think the first one be relate to the unwarranted influence of american jews on the medium and in the congress this one concern great|britain think say israel be a military burden on and that iran hope to reestablish the|persian|empire be not sure that remember earlier that president ford have express concern about the statement or apologize for this be something though that think be indicative of a need among the american people to know how the commander in chief the president feel and think the only criticism that would have of mr. ford be that immediately when the statement be reveal perhaps a statement from the president would have be a clarifying and a very beneficial thing the moderator mr. nelson question now to governor carter mr nelson governor despite the fact that have be run for president a long time now many americans still seem to be uneasy about do not feel that know or the people around and problem seem to be that have not reach out to bring people with broad background or national experience into campaign or presidential plan most of the people around on a day to day basis be the people have know in georgia many of be young and relatively inexperienced in national affair do not this raise a serious question as to whether would bring into a carter administration people with the necessary background to run the|federal|government mr carter do not believe do begin campaign at that time nobody think have a chance to win very few people know who be come from a tiny town as know plain and do not hold public office do not have very much money and first organization be people plus wife and child son and wife and win the nomination by go out into the street barbershop beauty parlor restaurant store in factory shift line also in farmer ' market and livestock sale barn and talk a lot and listen a lot and learn from the american people build up an awareness among the voter of this country particularly those in whose primary entered--30 of nobody have ever do that before about who be and what stand for now have a very wide range group of adviser who help prepare for these debate and who teach about international economic and foreign affair defense matter health education welfare government reorganization i'd say several|hundred of and be very fine and very highly qualified the major decision that have make since acquire the nomination and share this with president ford be the choice of the vice president think this would be indicative of the kind of leader that would choose to help if be elect choose senator walter|mondale and the only criterion that have put forward in own mind be who among the several|million people in this country would be the good person qualified to be president if something should happen to and to join in be vice president if should serve out term and be convinced now more than be when get the nomination that walter|mondale be the right choice and believe this be a good indication of the kind of people that would choose in the future mr. ford have have that same choice to make do not want to say anything critical of senator dole but have never hear mr. ford say that that be primary consideration who be the good person could choose in this country to be president of the|united|state feel completely at ease know that some day senator mondale may very well be president in the|last|five vice presidential nominee incumbent of have become president but think this be indicative of what would do the moderator president ford response please the president the governor may not have hear establish criterion for the selection of a vice president but be a well establish criterion that the person select would be fully qualified to be president of the|united|state and senator bob|dole be so year in the|house|of|representatives and in the senate very high responsibility on important committee do not mean to be critical of senator mondale but be very very surprised when read that senator mondale make a very derogatory very personal comment about general brown after the news story that break about general brown if recollection be correct indicate that general brown be not qualified to be a sewer commissioner do not think that be a proper way to describe a chairman of the|joint|chiefs|of|staff who have fight for country for and be sure the governor would agree with on that think senator dole would show more good judgment and discretion than to so describe a heroic and brave and very outstanding leader of the military so think selection of bob|dole as vice president be base on merit and if should ever become the president of the|united|state with vast experience as a member of the house and a member of the senate as well as a vice president think would do an outstanding job as president of the|united|state the moderator mr. kraft question to president ford mr kraft mr. president let assure and maybe some of the view audience that be on this panel have not be as may seem all torture and agony of the heartening thing be that and colleague have receive literally hundred and maybe even thousand of suggest question from ordinary citizen all across the country who want answer the president that be a tribute to interest in this election mr kraft will give that but let go on because main subject on the mind of all of have be the environment particularly curious about record people really want to know why veto the strip mining bill want to know why work against strong control on auto emission want to know why be not do anything about pollution of the|atlantic|ocean want to know why a bipartisan organization such as the|national|league|of|conservation|voters say that when come to environmental issue be and be quoting--"hopeless the president first let set the record straight veto the strip mining bill mr. kraft because be the overwhelming consensus of knowledgeable people that that strip mining bill would have mean the loss of literally thousand of job something around|140,000 job number that strip mining bill would have severely set back need for more coal and governor carter have say repeatedly that coal be the resource that need to use more in the effort to become independent of the arab oil supply so veto because of a loss of job and because would have interfere with energy independence program the auto emission be agree by leonard|woodcock the head of the uaw and by the head of all of the automobile industry have labor and management together say that those auto emission standard have to be modify but let talk about what the ford administration have do in the field of environment have increase as president by the funding for water treatment plant in the|united|state the federal contribution have fully fund the land and water conservation program in fact have recommend and the congress approve a substantially increase land and water conservation program have add in the|current|year budget the fund for the|national|park|service for example propose about|$12|million to add between|400|and|500 more employee for the|national|park|service and a|month|or|so|ago do likewise say over the|next|10|year should expand double the national park the wilderness area the scenic river area and then of course the final thing be that have sign and approve of more scenic river more wilderness area since have be president than any other president in the history of the|united|state the moderator governor carter mr carter well may say think the|league|of|conservation|voter be absolutely right this administration 's record of environment be very bad think be accurate to say that the strip mining law which be pass twice by the congress and only lack vote believe of be override would have be good for the country the claim that would have put miner out of work be hard to believe when at the time mr. ford veto the|united|mine|workers be support the bill and do not think would have support the bill have know that would lose job there have be a consistent policy on the part of this administration to lower or to delay enforcement of air pollution standard and water pollution standard and under both presidents nixon and ford money have be impound that would have go to city and other to control water pollution have no energy policy think be the only develop nation in the world that have no comprehensive energy policy to permit to plan in an orderly way how to shift from increase the scarce energy form oil and have research and development concentrate on the increase use of coal which strongly favor the research and development to be use primarily to make the coal burning be clean need a heritage trust program similar to the one have in georgia to set aside additional land that have geological and archeological importance natural area for enjoyment the land that mr. ford brag about have approve be in alaska and be enormous in size but as far as the accessibility of by the american people be very far in the future have take no strong position in the control of pollution of ocean and would say the bad threat to the environment of all be nuclear proliferation and this administration have be in office now for have still not take a strong and bold action to stop the proliferation of nuclear waste around the world particularly plutonium those be some brief remark about the failure of this administration would do the opposite in every respect the moderator mr. maynard to governor carter mr maynard governor federal policy in this country since world|war|ii have tend to favor the development of suburb at the great expense of central city do not now have an affirmative obligation to revitalize the american city have hear little in this campaign suggest that have an urban reconstruction program could please outline urban intention for tonight mr carter yes would be glad to in the first place as be the case with the environmental policy and energy policy that just describe and the policy for nonproliferation of nuclear waste this administration have no urban policy be impossible for mayor or governors to cooperate with the president because can not anticipate what be go to happen next a mayor of a city like new|york for example need to know or of time what responsibility the city will have in administration and in financing in thing like housing pollution control crime control education welfare and health this have not be do unfortunately remember the headline in the|daily|new that say ford to new|york drop|dead think be very important that city know that have a partner in quite often congress have pass law in the past design to help people with the ownership of home and with the control of crime and with adequate health care and well education program and so forth those program be design to help those who need most and quite often this have be in the very poor people and neighborhood in the downtown urban center because of the greatly advantage person who live in the suburb well education well organization more articulate more aware of what the law be quite often this money have be channel out of the downtown center where be need also favor all revenue share money be use for local government and also to remove the prohibition in the use of revenue sharing money so that can be use to improve education and health care have now for instance of the total education cost be finance by the|federal|government when the nixon ford administration start this be that be a 30-percent reduction in the portion that the|federal|government contribute to education in just|8|year and as know the education cost have go up tremendously the last point be that the major thrust have get to be to put people back to work have get an extraordinarily high unemployment rate among downtown urban ghetto area particularly among the very poor and particularly among minority group sometimes and the concentration of employment opportunity in those area would help greatly not only to reestablish the tax base but also to help reduce the extraordinary welfare cost of the major responsibility on the shoulder of new|york|city be to finance welfare and favor the shifting of the welfare cost away from the local government altogether and over a long period of time let the|federal|government begin to absorb part of that be now pay by the state government those thing would help a great deal with the city but still have a very serious problem there the moderator president ford the president let speak out very strongly the ford administration do have a very comprehensive program to help major metropolitan area fight for and the congress finally go along with a general revenue sharing program whereby city and states the city third and the states third get over a year in cash with which can provide many many service whatever really want in addition in the federal|government make available to city about|$3,300|million in what call community development in addition as a result of pressure on the congress get a major mass transit program over a period--$11,800 have a good housing program that will result in cut the down payment by and have mortgage payment lower at the beginning of any mortgage period be expand homestead housing program the net result be think under carla|hill who be the chairman of urban|development and neighborhood|revitalization program will really do a first class job in help the community throughout the country as a matter of fact that committee under secretary hills release about a 75-page report with specific recommendation so can do a well job in the|weeks|ahead and in addition the tax program of the ford administration which provide an incentive for industry to move into major metropolitan area into the inner city will bring job where people be and help to revitalize those city as can be the moderator mr. nelson question next to president ford mr nelson mr. president campaign have run ad in black newspaper say that for black americans president ford be quietly get the job do yet study after study have show little progress in desegregation and in fact actual increase in segregated school and housing in the northeast now civil right group have complain repeatedly that there have be lack of progress in commitment to an integrate society during administration so how be get the job do for black and other minority and what program do have in mind for the|next|4|years the president well let say at the outset be very proud of the record of this administration in the cabinet have of the outstanding think administrator as the secretary of transportation bill|coleman be familiar be sure with the recognition give in the|air|force to general james and there be just approve a star admiral the first in the history of the|united|states|navy so be give full recognition to individual of quality in the ford administration in position of great responsibility in addition the|department|of|justice be fully enforce and enforce effectively the legislation that involve job housing for minority not only black but all other the department of hud be enforce the new legislation that take care of redlining what be do be say that there be opportunity business opportunity educational opportunity responsibility where people with talent black or any other minority can fully qualify the office of minority business in the|department|of|commerce have make available more money in try to help black businessman or other minority businessman than any other administration since the office be establish the office of small business under mr. kobelinski have a very massive program try to help the black community the individual who want to start a business or expand business as a black businessman be able to borrow either directly or with guaranteed loan believe on the record that this administration have be responsive and have carry out the law to the letter and be proud of the record the moderator governor carter response please mr carter the description just make of this administration 's record be hard to recognize think be accurate to say that mr. ford vote against the voting right act and against the civil right act in debative stage think once be assure be go to pass finally vote for this country change drastically in when the term of john|kennedy and lyndon|johnson be over and richard|nixon and gerald|ford become the presidents there be a time when there be hope for those who be poor and downtrodden and who be elderly or who be ill or who be in minority group that time have be go think the great thing that ever happen to the south be the passage of the civil right act and the opening up of opportunity to black people to have a chance to vote to hold a job to buy a house to go to school and to participate in public affair not only liberate black people but also liberate the white have see in many instance in recent|years a minority affair section of a small loan administration small|business|administration lend a black entrepreneur just enough money to get start and then to go bankrupt the bankruptcy have go up an extraordinary degree the fha federal|housing|administration which use to be a very responsible agency that everyone look to to help own a home lose last|year there have be over|1,300 indictment in hud over|800 conviction relate just to home loan and now the|federal|government have become the world 's great slum landlord have get a 30-percent or 40-percent unemployment rate among minority young people and there have be no concerted effort give to the need of those who be both poor and black or poor and who speak a foreign language and that be where there have be a great generation of despair and ill health and lack of education and lack of purposefulness and a lack of hope for the future but do not take just a quiet dormant minimum enforcement of the law require an aggressive search out and reach out to help people who especially need and that be be lack in the|last|8|year the moderator mr. kraft to governor carter mr kraft governor carter in the nearly history of the constitution there have be only think be amendment most of on issue of the very broad principle now have propose amendment in many highly specialized cause like gun control school busing balanced budget school prayer abortion thing like that do think be appropriate to the dignity of the constitution to tack on amendment in a wholesale fashion and which of the one list that is balanced budget school busing school prayer abortion gun control which of those would really work hard to support if be president mr carter would not work hard to support any of those have always have think a lot of constitutional amendment propose but the passage of have be fairly slow and few and far between in the history there have be a very cautious approach to this quite often have a transient problem be strongly against abortion think abortion be wrong do not think the government ought to do anything to encourage abortion but do not favor a constitutional amendment on the subject but short of a constitutional amendment and within the confine of a supreme|court ruling will do everything can to minimize the need for abortion with well sex education family planning with well adoptive procedure personally do not believe that the|federal|government ought to finance abortion but draw the line and do not support a constitutional amendment however honor the right of people to seek the constitutional amendment on school busing on prayer in the school and on abortion but among those name will not actively work for the passage of any of the moderator president ford response please the president support the republican platform which call for a constitutional amendment that would outlaw abortion favor the particular constitutional amendment that would turn over to the states the individual right of the voter in those states the chance to make a decision by public referendum call that the people ' amendment think if really believe that the people of a state ought to make a decision on a matter of this kind that ought to have a federal constitutional amendment that would permit each of the states to make the choice think this be a reasonable and proper way to proceed believe also that there be some merit to an amendment that senator everett|dirksen propose very frequently an amendment that would change the court decision as far as voluntary prayer in public school seem to that there should be an opportunity as long as be voluntary as long as there be no compulsion whatsoever that an individual ought to have that right so in those case think such a constitutional amendment would be proper and really do not think in either case be trivial matter think be matter of very deep conviction as far as many many people in this country believe and therefore should not be treat lightly but be matter that be important and in those case would favor the moderator mr. maynard to president ford mr maynard mr. president twice have be the intend victim of would be assassin use handgun yet remain a steadfast opponent of substantive handgun control there be now some|40|million handgun in this country go up at the rate of a year and tragically those handgun be frequently purchase for self protection and wind up be use against a relative or a friend in light of that why do remain so adamant in opposition to substantive gun control in this country the president mr. maynard the record of gun control whether be in city or another or in some states do not show that the registration of a gun handgun or the registration of the gun owner have in any way whatsoever decrease the crime rate or the use of that gun in the committing of a crime the record just do not prove that such legislation or action by a local city council be effective what have to do and this be the crux of the matter be to make very very difficult for a person who use a gun in the commission of a crime to stay out of jail if make the use of a gun in the commission of a crime a serious criminal offense and that person be prosecute then in opinion be go after the person who use the gun for the wrong reason do not believe in the registration of handgun or the registration of the handgun owner that have not prove to be effective and therefore think the well way be to go after the criminal the individual who commit a crime in the possession of a gun and use that gun for a part of criminal activity those be the people who ought to be in jail and the only way to do be to pass strong legislation so that once apprehend indict convict will be in jail and off the street and not use gun in the commission of a crime mr maynard but mr. president do not think that the proliferation of the availability of handgun contribute to the possibility of those crime be commit and there be a second part to follow up very quickly there be as know and as have say jurisdiction around the country with strong gun control law the police official in those city contend that if there be a national law to prevent other jurisdiction from provide the weapon that then come into place like new|york that may have a well handle on the problem have consider that in analysis of the handgun proliferation problem the president yes have and the individual with whom have consult have not convince that a national registration of handgun or handgun owner will solve the problem be talk about the person who want to use a gun for an illegal purpose can get whether be register or outlaw will be obtain and be the people who ought to go behind bar should not in the process penalize the legitimate handgun owner and when go through the process of registration in effect be penalize that individual who use gun for a very legitimate purpose the moderator governor carter mr carter think be accurate to say that mr. ford 's position on gun control have change earlier mr. levi attorney general put forward a gun control proposal which mr. ford later believe espouse that call for the prohibition against the sale of the so call saturday night special would have put very strict control over who own a handgun have be a hunter all life and happen to own both shotgun rifle and a handgun and the only purpose that would see in register handgun and not long gun of any kind would be to prohibit the ownership of those gun by those who have use in the commission of a crime or who have be prove to be mentally incompetent to own a gun believe that limited approach to the question would be advisable and think adequate but that be as far as would go with the moderator mr. nelson to governor carter mr nelson governor have say the|supreme|court today be as put move back in the proper direction in ruling that have limit the right of criminal defendant and have compare the present supreme|court under chief justice burger very favorably with the more liberal court that have under chief justice warren so exactly what be get at and can elaborate on the kind of court think this country should have and can tell the kind of qualification and philosophy would look for as president in make supreme|court appointment mr carter while be governor of georgia although be not a lawyer have complete reform of the georgia court system streamline the structure of the court put in administrative office put a unified court system in and require that all severe sentence be review for uniformity and in addition to that put forward a proposal that be adopt and use throughout own term of office selection of all judge and district attorney prosecute attorney on the basis of merit every time have a vacancy on the|georgia|supreme|court and fill of those vacancy out of total and of judge about|35|percent of the trial judge be give from an objective panel the most highly qualified person in georgia and from those always choose the first or second so merit selection of judge be the most important single criterion and would institute the same kind of procedure as president not only in judicial appointment but also in diplomatic appointment secondly think that the|burger|court have fairly well confirm the major and most far reach and most controversial decision of the|warren|court civil right have be confirm by the|burger|court have not be reverse and do not think there be any inclination to reverse those basic decision of the man vote rule which be a very important one that strike down the unwarranted influence in the legislature of sparsely populated area of the states the right of indigent or very poor accuse person to legal counsel think the|burger|court have confirm that basic and very controversial decision of the|warren|court also the protection of an arrest person against unwarranted persecution in try to get a false confession but now think there have be a couple of instance where the|burger|court have make technical ruling where an obviously guilty person be later find to be guilty and think that in that case some of the more liberal member of the so call warren|court agree with those decision but the only thing that have point out be what have just say and that there be a need to clarify the technicality so that could not be force to release a person who be obviously guilty just because of a small technicality in the law and that be a reversal of position by the|burger|court with which do agree mr nelson governor do not believe answer question though about the kind of people would be look for for the court the type of philosophy would be look for if be make appointment to the|supreme|court as president mr carter okay think answer by say that would be on the basis of merit once the search and analysis procedure have be complete and once be give a list of the or good qualified person in the country would make a selection from among those person if the list be in opinion fairly uniform if there be no outstanding person then would undoubtedly choose someone who would most accurately reflect own basic political philosophy as best as could determine which would be to continue the progress that have be make under the|last|two|court the|warren|court and the|burger|court would also like to completely revise criminal justice system to do some of the thing at the federal level and court reform that just describe as have be do in georgia and other states and would like to appoint people who would be interested in help with that know chief justice burger be have not have help yet from the administration and from the congress to carry this out the emphasis think of the court system should be to interpret the constitution and the law equally between property protection and personal protection but when there be a very narrow decision which quite often be one that reach the|supreme|court think the choice should be with human right and that would be another factor that would follow the moderator president ford the president think the answer as to the kind of person that would select be obvious have opportunity to nominate an individual to the|supreme|court and select the|circuit|court|of|appeal judge from illinois john|paul|stevens select because of outstanding record as a circuit|court|of|appeal judge and be very pleased that an overwhelmingly democratic united|states|senate after go into background come to the conclusion that be fit and should serve and the vote in behalf be overwhelming so would say somebody in the format of justice stevens would be the kind of an individual that would select in the future as do in the past believe however a comment ought to be make about the direction of the burger|court the court that precede seem to that the miranda case be a case that really make very very difficult for the police the law enforcement people in this country to do what could to make certain that the victim of a crime be protect and that those that commit crime be properly handle and send to jail the miranda case the|burger|court be gradually change and be pleased to see that there be some step be make by the|burger|court to modify the so call miranda decision may make a correction of what governor carter say speak of gun control yes be true believe that the sale of saturday night special should be cut out but want the registration of handgun the moderator mr. kraft mr kraft mr. president the country be now in something that adviser call an economic pause think to most americans that sound like an antiseptic term for low growth unemployment standstill at a high high level decline in take home pay low factory earning more layoff be not that really a rotten record and do not administration bear most of the blame for the president well mr. kraft violently disagree with assessment and do not think the record justify the conclusion that come to let talk about the economic announcement that be make just this|past|week yes be announce that the gnp real growth in the|third|quarter be at but do realize that over the|last|10|year that be a high figure than the average growth during the 10-year period now be low than the growth in the|first|quarter and be low than the growth in the|second|quarter but every economist liberal conservative that be familiar with recognize that in the|fourth|quarter|of|this|year and in the|first|quarter|of|next|year that will have an increase in real gnp but now let talk about the plus that come out this|week have an 18-percent increase in housing start have a substantial increase in new permit for housing as a matter of fact base on the announcement this|week there will be at an annual rate new house build which be a tremendous increase over last|year and a substantial increase over the early part of this|year now in addition have some very good news in the reduction in the rate of inflation and inflation hit everybody those who be work and those who be on welfare the rate of inflation as announce just the other day be under|5|percent and the|4.4|percent that be indicate at the time of the gnp be less than mean that the american buyer be get a well bargain today because inflation be less mr kraft mr. president let ask this there have be an increase in layoff and that be something that bother everybody because even people that have a job be afraid be go to be fire do predict that increase in layoff do not that take by surprise have not administration be surprised by this pause in fact have not be so obsess with save money that do not even push the government to spend fund that be allocate the president mr. kraft think the record can be put in this way which be the way that think satisfie most americans since the depth of the recession have add job most importantly consumer confidence as survey by the reputable organization at the|university|of|michigan be at the high since in other word there be a grow public confidence in the strength of this economy and that mean that there will be more industrial activity mean that there will be a reduction in the unemployment mean that there will be increase hire mean that there will be increase employment now have have this pause but most economist regardless of political philosophy indicate that this pause for or be healthy because could not have honestly sustain a rate of growth which have in the|first|quarter|of|this|year now would like to point out as well that the|united|stat economic recovery from the recession of a|year|ago be well ahead of the economic recovery of any major free industrial nation in the world today be ahead of all of the western|european country be ahead of japan the|united|state be lead the free world out of the recession that be serious a|year|and|a|half|ago be go to see unemployment go down more job available and the rate of inflation go down and think this be a record that the american people understand and will appreciate the moderator governor carter mr carter well with all due respect to president ford think ought to be ashamed of make that statement because have the high unemployment rate now than have at any time between the|great|depression cause by herbert|hoover and the time president ford take office have get people out of job since have be in office more american people have lose job in the|last|4|month alone americans have go on the unemployment roll in the|last|month have have a net loss of job anybody who say that the inflation rate be in good shape now ought to talk to the housewife of the overwhelming result that have see in place be people feel that can not plan any more there be no way to make a prediction that family may be able to own a home or to put kid through college save account be lose money instead of gain money inflation be rob under the present administration nixon 's and have have time the inflation rate that experience under president johnson and president kennedy the economic growth be less than half today what be at the|beginning|of|this|year and housing start compare the housing start with last|year do not blame because in have few housing start in this country few home build than any year since that be and have get a 35-percent unemployment rate in many area of this country among construction worker and mr. ford have not do anything about and think this show a callous indifference to the family that have suffer so much have veto bill pass by congress within the congressional budget guideline job opportunity for americans will never have a balanced budget will never meet the need of people will never control the inflationary spiral as long as have or people out of work who be look for job and have probably get more|million people who be not look for job any more because have give up hope that be a very serious indictment of this administration be probably the bad of all the moderator mr. maynard mr maynard governor carter enter this race against president ford with a 20-point lead or well in the poll and now appear that this campaign be head for a photo finish have say how difficult be to run against a sit president but mr. ford be just as much an incumbent in july when be point ahead as be now can tell what cause the evaporation of that lead in opinion mr carter well that be not exactly an accurate description of what happen when be that far ahead be immediately follow the|democratic|convention and before the|republican|convention at that time or of the reagan supporter say that would not support president ford but as occur at the end of the|democratic|convention unify and think immediately follow the|republican|convention there be about a 10-point spread believe that to be accurate have president ford have the poll be good indication of fluctuation but vary widely from another and the only poll have ever follow be the one that know be take on election|day be in primary in the|spring and at first be obvious that do not have any standing in the poll as a matter of fact think when gallup run first poll in december|1975 do not even put name on the list have people on the list name be not even there at have about|2|percent so the poll to be interesting but do not determine hope or despair campaign among people have never depend on powerful political figure to put in office have a direct relationship with hundreds|of|thousand of people around the country who actively campaign for in georgia alone for instance get of the vote and think there be people in addition to on the ballot and governor wallace have be very strong in georgia that be an overwhelming support from own people who know good and today have about|500 georgians at own expense just work people who believe in spread around the country involve in the political campaign so the poll be interesting but do not know how to explain the fluctuation think a lot of depend on current event sometimes foreign affair sometimes domestic affair but think core of support among those who be crucial to the election have be fairly steady and success in the primary season be think notable for a newcomer from someone who be outside of washington who never have be a part of the washington establishment and think that will have a good result on november|2 for and hope for the country the moderator president ford response the president think the increase in the prospect as far as be concerned and the less favorable prospect for governor carter reflect that governor carter be inconsistent in many of the position that take tend to distort on a number of occasion just|a|moment|ago for example be indicate that in the 's for example unemployment be very low fail to point out that in the 's be engage in the war in vietnam mean in korea have young man in the army navy air|force and marines that be not the way to end unemployment or to reduce unemployment at the present time be at peace have reduce the number of people in the army navy air|force and marines from to be not at war have reduce the military manpower by if have that many more people in the army the navy the|air|force and marines unemployment figure would be considerably less but this administration do not believe the way to reduce unemployment be to go to war or to increase the number of people in the military so can not compare unemployment as seek to at the present time with the 's because the then administration have people in the military be at war be fight overseas and this administration have reduce the size of the military by be in the civilian labor market and be not fight anywhere around the world today the moderator thank gentleman this will complete questioning for this debate do not have time for more question and full answer so now each candidate will be allow up|to|4|minute for a close statement and at the original coin toss in philadelphia a|month|ago be determine that president ford would make the first closing statement tonight president ford the president for serve in the congress under president see work see make very hard decision do not always agree with decision whether be democratic or republican president for the|last|2|years have be the president and have find from experience that be much more difficult to make those decision than be to second guess become president at the time that the|united|stat be in a very troubled time have inflation of over|12|percent be on the brink of the bad recession in the|last|40|year be still deeply involved in the problem of vietnam the american people have lose faith and trust and confidence in the presidency that situation call for to first put the|united|state on a steady course and to keep keel well balance because have to face the difficult problem that have all of a sudden hit america think most people know that do not seek the presidency but be ask for help and assistance to be president for the|next|4|years during this campaign have see a lot of television show a lot of bumper sticker and a great many slogan of kind or another but those be not the thing that count what count be that the|united|state celebrate 200th birthday on july|4 as a result of that wonderful experience all over the|united|state there be a new spirit in america the american people be heal be work together the american people be move again and move in the right direction have cut inflation by better|than|half have come out of the recession and be well on the road to real prosperity in this country again there have be a restoration of faith and confidence and trust in the presidency because have be open candid and forthright have never promise more than could produce and have produce everything that promise be at peace not a single young american be fight or die on any foreign soil tonight have peace with freedom have be proud to be president of the|united|state during these very troubled time love america just as all of love america would be the high honor for to have support on november|2 and for to say jerry|ford have do a good job keep on do thank and good night the moderator thank president ford governor carter mr carter the major purpose of an election for president be to choose a leader someone who can analyze the depth of feeling in country to set a standard for people to follow to inspire people to reach for greatness to correct defect to answer difficulty to bind together in a spirit of unity do not believe the present administration have do that have be discourage and have be alienate sometimes have be embarrass sometimes have be ashamed people be out of work and there be a sense of withdrawal but country be innately very strong mr. ford be a good and decent man but have be in office now approach almost as long as john|kennedy be in office would like to ask the american people what have be accomplish a lot remain to be do own background be different from be a school board member and a library board member serve on a hospital authority and be in the state senate and be governor and be an engineer a naval officer a farmer a businessman believe require someone who can work harmoniously with the congress and can work closely with the people of this country and who can bring a new image and a new spirit to washington tax structure be a disgrace and need to be reform be governor of georgia for 4|year never increase sale taxis or income tax or property taxis as a matter of fact go out of office give a refund to the property taxpayer of georgia spend per person in this country every man woman and child for health care still rank 15th among all of the nation in the world in infant mortality and cancer rate be high than any country in the world do not have good health care could have employment ought to be restore to people have become almost a welfare state spend more on unemployment compensation than do when the republicans take over the|white|house people want to go back to work education system can be improve secrecy ought to be strip away from government and a maximum of personal privacy ought to be maintain housing program have go bad use to be that the average family could own a house but now less|than|a|third of people can afford to buy own home the budget be more grossly out of balance last|year than ever before in the history of country--$65 primarily because people be not at work inflation be rob as have already discuss and the government bureaucracy be just a horrible mess this do not have to be do not know all of the answer nobody could but do know that if the president of the|united|state and the|congress|of|the|united|state and the people of the|united|state say believe nation be great than what be now believe that if be inspire if can achieve a degree of unity if can set goal high enough and work toward recognize goal with industry and labor and agriculture along with government at all level can achieve great thing may have to do slowly there be no magic answer to but believe together can make great progress can correct difficult mistake and answer those very tough question believe in the greatness of country and believe the american people be ready for a change in washington have be drift too long have be dormant too long have be discourage too long and have not set an example for own people but believe that can now establish in the|white|house a good relationship with congress a good relationship with people set very high goal for country and with inspiration and hard work can achieve great thing and let the world know that be very important but more importantly let the people in own country realize that still live in the great nation|on|earth thank very much the moderator

to have be do but do really have a quarrel with this republican record would not have do any of those thing mr carter well think this republican administration have be almost all style and spectacular and not substance have get a chance tonight to talk about first of all leadership the character of country and a vision of the future in every of these instance the ford administration have fail and hope tonight that and mr. ford will have a chance to discuss the reason for those failure country be not strong any more be not respect any more can only be strong overseas if be strong at home and when become president will not only be strong in those area but also in defense a defense capability second to none have lose in foreign policy the character of the american people have ignore or exclude the american people and the congress from participation in the shaping of foreign policy be be of secrecy and exclusion in addition to that have have a chance to become now contrary to long stand belief and principle the arm merchant of the whole world have try to buy success from enemy and at the same time have exclude from the process the normal friendship of ally in addition to that have become fearful to compete with the|soviet|union on an equal basis talk about detente the|soviet|union know what want in detente and have be get have not know what have want and have be out trade in almost every instance the other point want to make be about defense have get to be a nation bless with the defense capability that be efficient tough capable well organized narrowly focused fighting capability the ability to fight if necessary be the good way to avoid the chance for or the requirement to fight and the last point want to make be this mr. ford mr. kissinger have continue on with the policy and failure of richard|nixon even the republican platform have criticize the lack of leadership in mr. ford and have criticize the foreign policy of this administration this be instance where agree with the republican platform may say this in closing and that is that as far as foreign policy go mr. kissinger have be the president of this country mr. ford have show an absence of leadership and an absence of a grasp of what this country be and what ought to be that be get to be change and that be of the major issue in this campaign of the moderator president ford would like to respond the president governor carter again be talk in broad generality let take just question that raise the military strength and capability of the|united|state governor carter in november|of|1975 indicate that want to cut the defense budget by a|few|months|later say want to cut the defense budget by or and more recently talk about cut the defense budget by there be no way can be strong militarily and have those kind of reduction in military appropriation now let just tell a little story about|late|october|of|1975 ask the then secretary of defense mr. schlesinger to tell what have to be do if be go to reduce the defense budget by a|few|days|later mr. schlesinger come back and say if cut the defense budget by will have to cut military personnel by civilian personnel by job in america by would have to stretch out aircraft procurement would have to reduce naval construction program would have to reduce the research and development for the army the navy the|air|force and marines by would have to close military basis in the|united|state immediately that be the kind of a defense program that mr. carter want let tell this straight from the shoulder do not negotiate with mr. brezhnev from weakness and the kind of a defense program that mr. carter want will mean a weak defense and a poor negotiating position the moderator mr. trewhitt a question for president ford mr trewhitt mr. president question really be the other side of the coin from mr. frankel 's for a generation the|united|state have have a foreign policy base on containment of communism yet have lose the first war in vietnam lose a shove match in angola communists threaten to come to power by peaceful mean in italy and relation generally have cool with the|soviet|union in the|last|few|month so let ask first what do do about such case as italy and secondly do this general drift mean that be move back toward something like an old cold war relationship with the|soviet|union the president do not believe should move to a cold|war relationship think be in the good interest of the|united|state and the world as a whole that the|united|state negotiate rather than go back to the cold war relationship with the|soviet|union do not look at the picture as bleakly as have indicate in question mr. trewhitt believe that the|united|states have have many success in recent|years and recent|months as far as the communist movement be concern have be successful in portugal where a|year|ago look like there be a very great possibility that the communists would take over in portugal do not happen have a democracy in portugal today a|few|months|ago or should say maybe the|soviet|union look like have continue strength in the|middle|east today accord to prime minister rabin the|soviet|union be weak in the|middle|east than have be in many many year the fact be the|soviet|union relationship with egypt be at a low level the|soviet|union relationship with syria be at a very low point the|united|state today accord to prime minister rabin of israel be at a peak in influence and power in the|middle|east but let turn for a|minute to the southern african operation that be now go on the|united|states|of|america take the initiative in southern africa want to end the bloodshed in southern africa want to have the right of self determination in southern africa want to have majority rule with the full protection of the right of the minority want to pro serve human dignity in southern africa have take initiative and in southern africa today the|united|stat be trust by the black frontline nation and black africa the|united|state be trust by the other element in southern africa the united|stat foreign policy under this administration have be of progress and success and believe that instead of talk about soviet progress can talk about american success and may make an observation part of the question ask mr. trewhitt do not believe that be in the good interest of the|united|state and the nato nation to have a communist government in nato mr. carter have indicate would look with sympathy to a communist government in nato think that would destroy the integrity and the strength of nato and be totally opposed to mr carter well mr. ford unfortunately have just make a statement that be not true have never advocate a communist government for italy that would obviously be a ridiculous thing for anyone to do who want to be president of the country think that this be an instance for deliberate distortion and this have occur also in the question about defense as a matter of fact have never advocate any cut of in defense budget as a matter of fact mr. ford have make a political football out of the defense budget about|a|year|ago cut the pentagon budget after fire james|schlesinger the political heat get so great that add back about|$3|billion when ronald|reagan win the texas primary election mr. ford add back another immediately before the kansas|city convention add back another in the defense budget and own office|of|management|and|budget testify that have a cut insurance add to the defense budget under the pressure from the pentagon obviously this be another indication of try to use the defense budget for political purpose which be try to do tonight now go into south|africa late after great|britain rhodesia the black nation have be try to solve this problem for many many|years do not go in until right before the election similar to what be take place in when mr. kissinger announce peace be at hand just before the election at that time and have weaken position in nato because the other country in europe support the democratic force in portugal long before do stick to the portugal dictatorship much longer than other democracy do in this world the moderator mr. valeriani a question for governor carter mr valeriani governor carter much of what the|united|state do abroad be do in the name of the national interest what be concept of the national interest what should the role of the|united|state in the world be and in that connection consider limited experience in foreign affair and the fact that take some pride in be a washington outsider do not think would be appropriate for to tell the american voter before the election the people that would like to have in key position such as secretary of state secretary of defense national security affair adviser at the|white|house mr carter well be not go to name cabinet before get elect have get a little way to go before start do that but have an adequate background believe be a graduate of the|u.s.|naval|academy the first military graduate since eisenhower have serve as governor of georgia and have travel extensively in foreign country in south|america central|america europe the|middle|east and in japan have travel the|last|21|month among the people of this country have talk to and have listen and have see at firsthand in a very vivid way the deep hurt that be come to this country in the aftermath of vietnam and cambodia and chile and pakistan and angola and watergate cia revelation what be formerly so proud of the strength of country moral integrity the representation in foreign affair of what people be what constitution stand for have be go and in the secrecy that have surround foreign policy in the|last|few|year the american people and the congress have be exclude believe know what this country ought to be have be who be love nation as many americans do and believe that there be no limit place on what can be in the future if can harness the tremendous resource militarily economically and the stature of people the meaning of constitution in the future every time have make a serious mistake in foreign affair be be because the american people have be exclude from the process if can just tap the intelligence and ability the sound commonsense and the good judgment of the american people can once again have a foreign policy to make proud instead of ashamed and be not go to exclude the american people from that process in the future as mr. ford and kissinger have do this be what take to have a sound foreign policy strong at home strong defense permanent commitment not betray the principle of country and involve the american people and the congress in the shaping of foreign policy every time mr. ford speak from a position of secrecy in negotiation and secret treaty that have be pursue and achieve in support dictatorship in ignore human right be weak and the rest of the world know so these be the way that can restore the strength of country and do not require long experience in foreign policy nobody have that except a president who serve a long time or a secretary of state but background experience knowledge of the people of this country commitment to principle that do not change those be the good basis to correct the horrible mistake of this administration and restore own country to a position of leadership in the world mr valeriani how specifically governor be go to bring the american people into the decisionmaking process in foreign policy what do that mean mr carter first of all would quit conduct the decisionmaking process in secret as have be a characteristic of mr. kissinger and mr. ford in many instance have make agreement like in vietnam that have be reveal later on to embarrassment recently ian|smith the president of rhodesia announce that have unequivocal commitment from mr. kissinger that could not reveal the american people do not know what those commitment be have see in the past a destruction of elect government like in chile and the strong support of military dictatorship there these kind of thing have hurt very much would restore the concept of the fireside chat which be an integral part of the administration of franklin|roosevelt and would also restore the involvement of the congress when harry|truman be president be not afraid to have a strong secretary of defense dean|acheson george|marshall be strong secretaries|of|state excuse state but also make sure that there be a bipartisan support the members of congress arthur|vandenburg walter|george be part of the process and before nation make a secret agreement and before make a bluffing statement be sure that have the backing not only of the president and the secretary of state but also of the congress and the people this be a responsibility of the president and think be very damaging to country for mr. ford to have turn over this responsibility to the secretary of state the moderator president ford do have a response the president governor carter again contradict complain about secrecy and yet be quote as say that in the attempt to find a solution in the|middle|east that would hold unpublicized meeting with the|soviet|union presume for the purpose of impose a settlement on israel and the arab nation but let talk just a minute about what have do to avoid secrecy in the ford administration after the|united|state take the initiative in work with israel and with egypt and achieve the sinai|ii agreement and be proud to say that not a single egyptian or israeli soldier have lose life since the signing of the sinai agreement but at the time that submit the sinai agreement to submit every single document that be applicable to the sinai ii agreement be the most complete documentation by any president of any agreement sign by a president on behalf of the|united|state now as far as meeting with the congress be concern during the|24|months that have be the president of the|united|state have average better than meeting a|month with responsible group or committee of the congress both house and senate the secretary of state have appear in the|several|years that be be the secretary before different committee hearing in the house and in the senate the secretary of state have make better|than|50 speech all over the|united|state explain american foreign policy have make speech in various part of the country where have discuss with the american people defense and foreign policy the moderator mr. frankel a question for president ford mr frankel mr. president would like to explore a little more deeply relationship with the russians use to brag back in khrushchev 's day that because of great patience and because of greed for business deal that would sooner or later get the well of be possible that despite some setback in the|middle|east have prove point ally in france and italy be now flirt with communism have recognize a permanent communist regime in east|germany virtually sign in helsinki an agreement that the russians have dominance in bail out soviet agriculture with huge grain sale have give large loan access to good technology and if the senate have not interfere with the|jackson|amendment maybe would have give even large loan be that what call a way street of traffic in europe the president believe that have negotiate with the|soviet|union since have be president from a position of strength and let cite several example shortly after become president in december|of|1974 meet with general secretary brezhnev in vladivostok and agree to a mutual cap on the ballistic missile launcher at a ceiling of which mean that the|soviet|union if that become a permanent agreement will have to make a reduction in launcher that now have or plan to have negotiate at vladivostok with mr. brezhnev a limitation on the mirving of ballistic missile at a figure of which be the first time that any president have achieve a cap either on launcher or on mirv 's seem to that can go from there to the grain sale the grain sale have be a benefit to american agriculture have achieve a sale of a minimum of 6|million|metric|tons which mean that have already buy about|4|million|metric|ton this|year and be bind to buy another|2|million|metric|ton to take the grain and corn and wheat that the american farmer have produce in order to have full production and these grain sale to the|soviet|union have help tremendously in meet the cost of the additional oil and the oil that have buy from overseas if turn to helsinki be glad raise mr. frankel in the case of helsinki nation sign an agreement include the secretary of state for the vatican can not under any circumstance believe that holiness the pope would agree by sign that agreement that the nation have turn over to the warsaw|pact nation the domination of just be not true and if mr. carter allege that holiness by sign that have do be totally inaccurate now what have be accomplish by the helsinki agreement number have an agreement where notify and notify of any military maneuver that be to be undertake have do in both case where have do so there be no soviet domination of and there never will be under a ford administration mr frankel be sorry could just follow do understand to say sir that the russians be not use as own sphere of influence and occupy most of the country there and make sure with troop that be a communist zone whereas on side of the line the italians and the french be still flirt with the possibility of communism the president do not believe mr. frankel that the yugoslavians consider dominate by the|soviet|union do not believe that the romanians consider dominate by the|soviet|union do not believe that the poles consider dominate by the|soviet|union each of those country be independent autonomous have own territorial integrity and the|united|state do not concede that those country be under the domination of the|soviet|union as a matter of fact visit poland yugoslavia and romania to make certain that the people of those country understand that the president of the|united|state and the people of the|united|state be dedicated to independence autonomy and freedom the moderator governor carter have a response mr carter well in the first place be not criticize holiness the pope be talk about mr. ford the fact be that secrecy have surround the decision make by the ford administration in the case of the helsinki agreement may have be a good agreement at the beginning but have fail to enforce the so call basket part which ensure the right of people to migrate to join family to be free to speak out the|soviet|union be still jam radio|free|europe radio|free|europe be be jam have also see a very serious problem with the so call sonnenfeldt document which apparently mr. ford have just endorse which say that there be an organic linkage between the eastern|european country and the|soviet|union and would like to see mr. ford convince the|polish|american and the|czech|american and the|hungarian|american in this county that those country do not live under the domination and supervision of the|soviet|union behind the iron curtain also have see mr. ford exclude from access to the public have not have a tough cross - examination type press conference in over|30|day press conference have without sound be also show a weakness in yield to pressure the|soviet|union for instance put pressure on mr. ford and refuse to see a symbol of human freedom recognize around the world the arabs have put pressure on mr. ford and be yield and have permit a boycott by the arab country of american business who trade with israel who have american jews own or take part in the management of american company own secretary of commerce have to be subpenae by the congress to reveal the name of business who be subject to this boycott do not volunteer the information have to be subpenaed and the last thing would like to say be this this grain deal with the|soviet|union in be terrible and mr. ford make up for with embargo against own ally in japan that be not the way to run foreign policy include international trade the moderator mr. trewhitt a question for governor carter mr trewhitt governor would like to pick up on that point actually and on appeal for a great measure of american idealism in foreign affair foreign affair come home to the american public pretty much in such issue as oil embargo and grain sale that sort of thing would be willing to risk an oil embargo in order to promote human right in iran saudi|arabia withhold arm from for the same purpose as a matter of fact think have perhaps answer this final part but would withhold grain from the|soviet|union in order to promote civil right in the|soviet|union mr carter would never single out food as a trade embargo item if ever decide to impose an embargo because of a crisis in international relationship would include all shipment of all equipment for instance if the arab country ever again declare an embargo against nation on oil would consider that not a military but an economic declaration of war and would respond instantly and in kind would not ship that arab country anything no weapon no spare part for weapon no oil drilling rig no oil pipe no nothing would not single out just food another thing would like to say be this in international trade as say in opening statement have become the arm merchant of the world when this republican administration come into office be ship about|$1|billion worth of arm overseas now worth of arm overseas to country that quite often use these weapon to fight each other the shift in emphasis have be very disturbing to speak about the|middle|east under the last democratic administration of all weapon that go into the|middle|east be for israel nowadays--75|percent be for israel before now go to the arab country and this do not include iran if include iran present shipment of weapon to the|middle|east only|20|percent go to israel this be a deviation from idealism be a deviation from a commitment to major ally in the|middle|east which be israel be a yielding to economic pressure on the part of the arabs on the oil issue and be also a tremendous indication that under the ford administration have not address the energy policy adequately still have no comprehensive energy policy in this country and be an overall sign of weakness when be weak at home economically high unemployment high inflation a confused government a wasteful defense establishment this encourage the kind of pressure that be be put on successfully would have be inconceivable for to be bring to knee with an arab oil embargo but be do and be still put pressure on from the arab country to discredit around the world these be the weakness that see and believe be not just a matter of idealism be a matter of be tough be a matter of be strong be a matter of be consistent priority ought to be first of all to meet own military need secondly to meet the need of ally and friend and only then should ship military equipment to foreign country as a matter of fact iran be go to get f-14 's before even meet own order for f-14 's and the shipment of spruance|class|destroyer to iran be much more highly sophisticated than the spruance class destroyers that be presently be deliver to own navy this be ridiculous and ought to be change mr trewhitt governor let pursue that if may if understand correctly would in fact to use example withhold arm from iran and saudi|arabia even if the risk be an oil embargo and if should be secure those arm from somewhere else and then if the embargo come then would respond in kind do have correctly mr carter if iran be not an arab country as know be a moslem country but if saudi|arabia should declare an oil embargo against then would consider that an economic declaration of war and would make sure that the saudis understand this ahead of time so there would be no doubt in mind think under those circumstance would refrain from push to knee as do in with the previous oil embargo the moderator president ford the president governor carter apparently do not realize that since have be president have sell to the israelis over in military hardware have make available to the israelis over|45|percent of the total economic and military aid since the establishment of israel 27|years|ago so the ford administration have do a good job in help good ally israel and be dedicated to the survival and security of israel believe that governor carter do not realize the need and necessity for arm sale to iran indicate would not make those iran be border very extensively by the|soviet|union iran have iraq as of neighbor the|soviet|union and the communist dominate government of iraq be neighbor of iran and iran be an ally of the|united|state be strong feeling that ought to sell arm to iran for own national security and as an ally a strong ally of the|united|state the history of relationship with iran go back to the day of president truman when decide that be vitally necessary for own security as well as that of iran that should help that country and iran have be a good ally in when there be an oil embargo iran do not participate iran continue to sell oil to the|united|state believe that be in interest and in the interest of israel and iran and saudi|arabia for the|united|state to sell arm to those country be for security as well as ours the moderator mr. valeriani a question for president ford mr valeriani mr. president the policy of administration be to normalize relation with mainland china that mean establish at some point full diplomatic relation and obviously do something about the mutual defense treaty with taiwan if be elect will move to establish full diplomatic relation with peking and will abrogate the mutual defense treaty with taiwan and as a corollary would provide mainland china with military equipment if the chinese be to ask for the president relationship with the|people's|republic|of|china be base upon the shanghai communiqu that communiqu all for the normalization of relation between the|united|state and the|people's|republic do not set a time schedule do not make a determination as to how that relationship should be achieve in relationship to current diplomatic recognition and obligation to the|taiwanese|government the shanghai communiqu say that the difference between the|people's|republic on the hand and taiwan on the other shall be settle by peaceful mean the net result be this administration and during time as the president for the|next|4|years will continue to move for normalization of relation in the traditional sense and will insist that the dispute between taiwan and the|people's|republic be settle peacefully as be agree in the shanghai communiqu the ford administration will not let down will not eliminate or forget obligation to the people of taiwan feel that there must be a continue obligation to the people the some people in taiwan and as move during the|next|4|years those will be the policy of this administration mr valeriani sir the military equipment for the mainland chinese the president there be no policy of this government to give to the|people's|republic or to sell to the|people's|republic|of|china military equipment do not believe that the|united|state should sell give or otherwise transfer military hardware to the|people's|republic|of|china or any other communist nation such as the|soviet|union and the like the moderator governor carter mr carter would like to go back just moment to the previous question where mr. ford think confuse the issue by try to say that be ship israel of aid as a matter of fact during this|current|year be ship iran or have contract to ship to iran about|$7?|billion worth of arm and also to saudi|arabia about|$7?|billion worth of arm also in almost bring israel to knee after the yom kippur war by the so call reassessment of relationship to israel in effect try to make israel the scapegoat for the problem in the|middle|east and this weaken relationship with israel a great deal and put a cloud on the total commitment that people feel toward the israelis there ought to be a clear unequivocal commitment without change to israel in the|far|east think need to continue to be strong and would certainly pursue the normalization of relationship with the|people's|republic|of|china open up a great opportunity in -which have pretty well be fritter away under mr. ford that ought to be a constant inclination toward friendship but would never let that friendship with the|people's|republic|of|china stand in the way of the preservation of the independence and freedom of the people on taiwan the moderator mr. frankel a question for governor carter mr frankel governor always seem in election and maybe in between too to argue about who can be tough in the world give or take a|few|billion|dollar give or take weapon system lead politician and think gentleman seem to settle roughly on the same strategy in the world at roughly the same pentagon budget cost how bad do thing have to get in own economy or how much backwardness and hunger would take in the world to persuade that national security and survival require very drastic cutback in arm spending and dramatic new effort in other direction mr carter well always in the past have have an ability to have a strong defense and also to have a strong domestic economy and also to be strong in reputation and influence within the community of nation these characteristic of country have be endanger under mr. ford be no longer respect in a showdown vote in the|united|nation or in any other international council be lucky to get of the other nation to vote with ally feel that have neglect the so call nixon shock against japan have weaken relationship there under this administration have also have an inclination to keep separate the european country think that if be separate then can dominate and proceed with secret lone|ranger type diplomatic effort would also like to point out that in this country have let economy go down the drain the bad inflation since the|great|depression the high unemployment of any develop nation of the world have a high unemployment rate in this country than great|britain than west|germany unemployment rate be twice as high as be in italy be three|or|four time as high as be in japan and that terrible circumstance in this country be export overseas comprise about|30|percent of the world 's economic trade power influence and when be weak at home weak than all ally that weakness weaken the whole free world so strong economy be very important another thing that need to do be to reestablish the good relationship that ought to have between the|united|state and natural ally and friend have feel neglect and use that base of strength and use the idealism the honesty the predictability the commitment the integrity of own country that be where strength lie and that would permit to deal with the develop nation in a position of strength under this administration have bad a continuation of a so call balance of power politic where everything be look on as a struggle between on the side and the|soviet|union on the other ally the small country get trample in the rush what need be to try to seek individualized bilateral relationship with country regardless of size and to establish world order politic which mean want to preserve peace through strength also want to revert back to the stature and the respect that country have in previous administration now can not say when this can come but can guarantee will not come if gerald|ford be reelect and this present policy be continue will come if be elect mr frankel if hear right sir be say gun and butter both but president johnson also have trouble keep up both vietnam and domestic program be really ask when do the need of the city and own need and those of other backward and even more needy country and society around the world take precedence over some of military spending ever mr carter let say very quickly that under president johnson in spite of the massive investment in the|vietnam|war turn over a balanced budget to mr. nixon the unemployment rate be less|than|4|percent the inflation rate under kennedy and johnson be about|2|percent out third what be under this administration so do have at that time with good management the ability to do both do not think anybody can say that johnson and kennedy neglect the poor and the destitute people in this country or around the world but can say this the number responsibility of any president above all else be to guarantee the security of nation an ability to be free of the threat of attack or blackmail and to carry out obligation to ally and friend and to carry out a legitimate foreign policy must go hand in hand but the security of this nation have get to come first the moderator president ford the president let say very categorically can not maintain the security and the strength of the|united|state with the kind of defense budget cut that governor carter have indicate in want to cut the budget be now down to a figure of reduction of that kind will not permit the|united|state to be strong enough to deter aggression and maintain the peace governor carter apparently do not know the fact as soon as become president initiate meeting with the nato head of state and meet with in brussels to discuss how could improve the defense relationship in western|europe in november|of|1975 meet with the leader of the industrial nation in france for the purpose of see what could do act together to meet the problem of the come recession in puerto|rico this|year meet with of the lead industrial nation ' head of state to meet the problem of inflation so would be able to solve before get out of hand have meet with the head of government bilaterally as well as multilaterally relation with japan have never be well be the first united|stat president to visit japan and have the emperor of japan here this|past|year and the net result be japan and the|united|state be work more closely together now than at any time in the history of relationship can go around the world and let take israel for example just recently president prime minister rabin say that relation be never well the moderator mr. trewhitt a question for president ford mr trewhitt mr. president refer earlier to meeting with mr. brezhnev at vladivostok in agree on that occasion to try to achieve another strategic arm limitation salt agreement within the|year nothing happen in or not very much publicly at least and those talk be still drag and thing get quieter as the current season approach be there a bit of politic involve there perhaps on both side or perhaps more important be interim weapon development and be think of such thing as the cruise missile and the soviet ss-20 intermediate range rocket make salt irrelevant bypass the salt negotiation the president first have to understand that salt expire october|3,|1977 mr. brezhnev and meet in vladivostok in december|of|1974 for the purpose of try to take the initial step so could have a salt ii agreement that would go to as indicate earlier do agree on a limitation on launcher of ballistic missile that would mean a cutback in the soviet program would not interfere with program at the same time put a limitation of on mirv 's technician have be work since that time in geneva try to put into technical language an agreement that can be verify by both party in the meantime there have develop the problem of the|soviet|backfire high performance aircraft which say be not a long range aircraft and which some of people say be an intercontinental aircraft in the interim there have be the development on part primarily the cruise missile cruise missile that could be launch from land base mobile installation cruise missile that could be launch from high performance aircraft like the|b-52 's or l 's which hope proceed with cruise missile which could be launch from either surface or submarine naval vessel those gray area weapon system be create some problem in the agreement for a|salt|ii negotiation but can say that be dedicated to proceed and meet just|last|week with the foreign minister of the|soviet|union and indicate to that the|soviet|union be interested in narrow the difference and make a realistic and a sound compromise hope and trust in the good interest of both country and in the good interest of all people throughout this globe that the|soviet|union and the|united|state can make a mutually beneficial agreement because if do not and salt expire on october|3,|1977 will unleash again an all out nuclear arm race with the potential of a nuclear holocaust of unbelievable dimension so be the obligation of the president to do just that and intend to do so mr trewhitt mr. president let follow that up will submit that the cruise missile add a whole new dimension to the arm competition and then cite a statement by office to the arm control association a|few|days|ago in which say that the cruise missile may eventually be include in a comprehensive arm limitation agreement but that in the meantime be an essential part of the american strategic arsenal now may assume from that that be tend to exclude the cruise missile from the next salt agreement or be still negotiable in that context the president believe that the cruise missile which be now develop in research and development across the spectrum from air from the sea or from the land can be include within a salt ii agreement be a new weapon system that have a great potential both conventional and nuclear armed at the same time have to make certain that the|soviet|union 's backfire which claim be not an intercontinental aircraft and which some of people contend be must also be include if be to get the kind of an agreement which be in the good interest of both country and really believe that be far well for and for the|soviet|union and more importantly for the people around the world that these super power find an answer for a salt ii agreement before october|3,|1977 think good will on both part hard bargaining by both party and a reasonable compromise will be in the good interest of all party the moderator governor carter mr carter well mr. ford act like be run for president for the first time have be in office 2|year and there have be absolutely no progress make toward a new salt agreement have learn the date of the expiration of salt apparently have see in this world a development of a tremendous threat to as a nuclear engineer know the limitation and capability of atomic power also know that as far as the human being on this earth be concern that the nonproliferation of atomic weapon be number only in the|last|few|day with the election approach have mr. ford take any interest in a nonproliferation movement advocate in a speech at the|united|nation that move immediately as a nation to declare a complete moratorium on the testing of all nuclear device both weapon and peaceful device that not ship any more atomic fuel to a country that refuse to comply with strict control over the waste which can be reprocess into explosive have also advocate that stop the sale by germany and france of reprocess plant to pakistan and brazil mr. ford have not move on this also need to provide an adequate supply of enrich uranium mr. ford again under pressure from the atomic energy lobby have insist that this reprocessing or rather reenrichment be do by private industry and not by the exist government plant this kind of confusion and absence of leadership have let drift now for with the constantly increase threat of atomic weapon throughout the world now have nation that have atomic bomb that know about if continue under mr. ford 's policy by or will have nation that have the capability of explode atomic weapon this have get to be stop that is of the major challenge and major undertaking that will assume as the next president the moderator mr. valeriani a question for governor carter mr valeriani governor carter earlier|tonight say america be not strong anymore america be not respect anymore and feel must ask do really believe that the|united|states be not the strong country in the world do really believe that the|united|states be not the most respected country in the world or be that just campaign rhetoric mr carter no be not just campaign rhetoric think that militarily be as strong as any nation on earth think have get to stay that way and continue to increase capability to meet any potential threat but as far as strength derive from commitment to principle as far as strength derive from the unity within country as far as strength derive from the people the congress the secretary of state the president share in the evolution and carry out of a foreign policy as far as strength derive from the respect of own ally and friend assurance that will be staunch in commitment that will not deviate and will give adequate attention as far as strength derive from do what be right care for the poor provide food become the breadbasket of the world instead of the arm merchant of the world in those respect be not strong also will never be strong again overseas unless be strong at home and with economy in such terrible disarray and get bad by the|month have get more americans unemployed today than have have get more americans out of work now than have when mr. ford take office this kind of deterioration in economic strength be bind to weaken around the world and not only have problem at home but export those problem overseas so as far as the respect of own people toward own government as far as participation in the shaping of concept and commitment as far as a trust of country among the nation of the world as far as dependence of country in meet the need and obligation that have express to ally as far as the respect of country even among potential adversary be weak potentially be strong under this administration that strength have not be realize the moderator president ford the president governor carter brag about the unemployment during democratic administration and condemn the unemployment at the present time must remind that be at peace and during the period that brag about unemployment be low the|united|states be at war now let correct other comment that governor carter have make have recommend to the congress that develop the uranium enrichment plant at portsmouth ohio which be a publicly own us government facility and have indicate that the private program which would follow on in alabama be one that may or may not be construct but commit to the at portsmouth ohio the governor also talk about morality in foreign policy the foreign policy of the|united|states meet the high standard of morality what be more moral than peace and the|united|state be at peace today what be more moral in foreign policy than for the administration to take the lead in the|world|food|conference in rome in when the|united|state commit 6|million|metric|ton of food over of the food commit for the disadvantaged and underdeveloped nation of the world the ford administration want to eradicate hunger and disease in underdeveloped country throughout the world what be more moral than for the|united|state under the ford administration to take the lead in southern africa in the|middle|east those be initiative in foreign policy which be of the high moral standard and that be indicative of the foreign policy of this country the moderator mr. frankel a question for president ford mr frankel mr. president can stick with morality for a lot of people seem to cover a bunch of sin mr. nixon and mr. kissinger use to tell that instead of morality have to worry in the world about live with and let live all kind of government that really do not like north and south|korean dictator chilean fascist chinese communists iranian emperor and so on say the only way to get by in a wicked world be to treat other on the basis of how treat and not how treat own people but more recently seem to have take a different tack seem to have decide that be part of business to tell the rhodesians for instance that the way be treat own black people be wrong and have get to change government and put pressure on be rather liberal in advice to the italians as to how to vote be this a new ford foreign policy in the making can expect that be now go to turn to south|africa and force to change government to intervene in similar way to end the bloodshed as call say in chile or chilean prison and to throw weight around for the value that hold dear in the world the president believe that foreign policy must express the high standard of morality and the initiative that take in southern africa be the good example of what this administration be do and will continue to do in the|next|4|years if the|united|state have not move when do in southern africa there be no doubt there would have be an acceleration of bloodshed in that tragic part of the world if have not take initiative be very very possible that the|government|of|rhodesia would have be overrun and that the|soviet|union and the cubans would have dominate southern africa so seek to preserve the principle of self determination to eliminate the possibility of bloodshed to protect the right of the minority as insist upon the right of the majority believe follow the good conscience of the american people in foreign policy and believe that have use skill secretary of state kissinger have do a superb job in work with the black african nation the so call frontline nation have do a superb job in get the prime minister of south|africa mr. vorster to agree that the time have come for a solution to the problem of rhodesia secretary kissinger in meeting with prime minister smith of rhodesia be able to convince that be in the good interest of white as well as black in rhodesia to find an answer for a transitional government and then a majority government this be a perfect example of the kind of leadership that the|united|stat under this administration have take and can assure that this administration will follow that high moral principle in future effort in foreign policy include effort in the|middle|east where be vitally important because the|middle|east be the crossroad of the world there have be more dispute and be an area where there be more volatility than any other place in the world but because arab nation and the israelis trust the|united|state be able to take the lead in the sinai|ii agreement and can assure that the|united|state will have the leadership role in move toward a comprehensive settlement of the middle|eastern problem hope and trust as soon as possible and will do with the high moral principle ms. frankel mr. president just clarify point there be lot of majority in the world that feel be be push around by minority government and be say can now expect to look to for not just good cheer but throw weight on side in south|africa or on taiwan or in chile to help change government as in rhodesia the president would hope that as move to area of the world from another and the|united|state must not spread too thinly that be of the problem that help to create the circumstance in vietnam but as as a nation find that be ask by the various party either nation against another or individual within a nation that the|united|states will take the leadership and try to resolve the difference let take south|korea as an example have personally tell president park that the|united|states do not condone the kind of repressive measure that have take in that country but think in all fairness and equity have to recognize the problem that south|korea have on the north have north|korea with well train well equip troop be support by the|people's|republic|of|china be support by the|soviet|union face a very delicate situation now the|united|state in this case this administration have recommend a|year|ago and have reiterate again this|year that the|united|state south|korea north|korea and the|people's|republic|of|china sit down at a conference table to resolve the problem of the korean peninsula this be a leadership role that the|united|stat under this administration be carry out and if do and think the opportunity and the possibility be get well will have solve many of the internal domestic problem that exist in south|korea at the present time the moderator governor carter mr carter notice that mr. ford do not comment on the prison in chile this be a typical example maybe of many other where this administration overthrow an elect government and help to establish a military dictatorship this have not be an ancient history story last|year under mr. ford of all the|food|for|peace that go to south|america go to the military dictatorship in chile another point want to make be this say have to move from area of the world to another that be of the problem with this administration 's so call shuttle diplomacy while the secretary of state be in country there be almost|150 other that be wonder what be go to do next what will be the next secret agreement do not have a comprehensive understandable foreign policy that deal with world problem or even regional problem another thing that concern be what mr. ford say about unemployment that insinuate that under johnson and kennedy that unemployment could only be hold down when this country be at war karl|marx say that the free enterprise system in a democracy can only continue to exist when be at war or prepare for war karl|marx be the grandfather of communism do not agree with that statement hope mr. ford do not either have put pressure on the congress and do not believe mr. ford would even deny this to hold up on nonproliferation legislation until the congress agree for an program for private industry to start produce enrich uranium and the last thing want to make be this talk about peace and be thankful for peace be peaceful when mr. ford go into office but and mr. kissinger and other try to start a new vietnam in angola and be only the outcry of the american people and the congress when this secret deal be discover that prevent renew involvement in that conflagration which be take place there the moderator gentleman be sorry to say do not have time enough for complete sequence of question now have only|12|minute leave therefore would like to ask for short question and short answer and also will drop the follow up question each candidate may still respond of course to the other 's answer mr. trewhitt a question for governor carter mr trewhitt governor carter before this event the most communication receive concerned panama would as president be prepared to sign a treaty which at a fix date yield administrative and economic control of the|canal|zone and share defense which as understand be the position the|united|state take in mr carter well here again the panamanian question be that have be confuse by mr. ford have direct diplomatic representative to yield to the panamanians full sovereignty over the|panama|canal|zone at the end of a certain period of time when mr. reagan raise this question in florida mr. ford not only disavow instruction but also even drop parenthetically the use of the word would never give up complete control or practical control of the|panama|canal|zone but would continue to negotiate with the panamanians when the original treaty be sign back in the|early|1900 's when theodore|roosevelt be president panama retain sovereignty over the|panama|canal|zone retain control as though have sovereignty now would be willing to go ahead with negotiation believe that could share more fully responsibility for the|panama|canal|zone with panama would be willing to continue to raise the payment for shipment of good through the|panama|canal|zone may even be willing to reduce to some degree military emplacement in the|panama|canal|zone but would not relinquish practical control of the|panama|canal|zone any time in the foreseeable future the moderator president ford the president the|united|state must and will maintain complete access to the|panama|canal the|united|states must maintain a defense capability of the|panama|canal and the|united|state will maintain national security interest in the|panama|canal the negotiation for the|panama|canal start under president johnson and have continue up to the present time believe those negotiation should continue but there be certain guideline that must be follow and have just define let take just|a|minute to comment on something that governor carter say on nonproliferation in may|of|1975 call for a conference of nuclear supplier that conference have meet time in may|of|this|year governor carter take the first initiative approximately|12|month after have take initiative a|year|ago the moderator mr. valeriani a question for president ford mr valeriani mr. president the government general accounting|office have just put out a report suggest that shoot from the hip in the mayaguez rescue mission and that ignore diplomatic message say that a peaceful solution be in prospect why do not do more diplomatically at the time and a related question do house try to prevent the release of that report the president the|white|house do not prevent the release of that report on july|12|of|this|year give full permission for the release of that report be very disappointed in the fact that the gao release that report because think interject political partisan politic at the present time but let comment on the report somebody who sit in washington d.c. after the mayaguez incident can be a very good grandstand quarterback and let make another observation this|morn get a call from the skipper of the mayaguez be furious because tell that be the action of president ford that save the life of the crew of the mayaguez and can assure that if have not take the strong and forceful action that do would have be criticize very very severely for sit back and not move captain miller be thankful the crew be thankful do the right thing seem to that those who sit in washington after the incident be not the good judge of the decisionmaking process that have to be make by the|national|security|council and by at the time the incident be develop in the pacific let assure that make every possible overture to the|people's|republic|of|china and through to make diplomatic protest to the|cambodian|government through the|united|nation every possible diplomatic mean be utilize but at the same time have a responsibility and so do the|national|security|council to meet the problem at hand and handle responsibly and think captain miller 's testimony to that effect be the good evidence the moderator governor carter mr carter well be reluctant to comment on the recent report have not read think the american people have only requirement that the fact about mayaguez be give to accurately and completely mr. ford have be there for have the fact that be release today immediately after the mayaguez incident understand that the report today be accurate mr. ford have say believe that be accurate and that the|white|house make no attempt to block the issuing of that report do not know if that be exactly accurate or not understand that both the|department|of|state and the|defense|department have approve the accuracy of today 's report or yesterday 's report and also the|national|security|agency do not know what be right or what be wrong or what be do the only thing believe be that whatever the knowledge be that mr. ford have should have be give to the american people 18|months|ago immediately after the mayaguez incident occur this be what the american people want when something happen that endanger security or when something happen that threaten stature in the world or when american people be endanger by the action of a foreign country just sailor on the mayaguez obviously have to move aggressively and quickly to rescue but then after the immediate action be take believe the president have an obligation to tell the american people the truth and not wait for the report to be issue the moderator gentleman at this time have time for only|two very short question mr. frankel a question for governor carter mr frankel governor carter if the price of gain influence among the arabs be close eye a little bit to boycott against israel how would handle that mr carter believe that the boycott of american business by the arab country because those business trade with israel or because have american jews who be owner or director in the company be an absolute disgrace this be the first time that remember in the history of country when have let a foreign country circumvent or change will do everything can as president to stop the boycott of american business by the arab country be not a matter of diplomacy or trade with be a matter of morality and do not believe that the arab country will pursue when have a strong president who will protect the integrity of country the commitment of constitution and bill|of|right and protect people in this country who happen to be jews may later be catholics may later be baptists who be threaten by some foreign country but ought to stand staunch and think be a disgrace that so far mr. ford 's administration have block the passage of legislation that would have reveal by law every instance of the boycott and would have prevent the boycott from continue the moderator president ford the president again governor carter be inaccurate the arab boycott action be first take in and in november|of|1975 be the first president to order the executive branch to take action affirmative action through the|department|of|commerce and other cabinet departments to make certain that no american businessman or business organization should discriminate against jews because of an arab boycott and may add that administration and be very proud of be the first administration that have take an antitrust action against company in this country that have allegedly cooperate with the arab boycott just on monday|of|this|week sign a tax bill that include an amendment that would prevent company in the|united|state from take a tax deduction if have in any way whatsoever cooperate with the arab boycott and last|week when be try to get the|export|administration|act through the congress necessary legislation administration go to capitol|hill and try to convince the house and the senate that should have an amendment on that legislation which would take strong and effective action against those who participate or cooperate with the arab boycott other point because the congress fail to act be go to announce tomorrow that the|department|of|commerce will disclose those company that have participate in the arab boycott this be something that can do the congress fail to do and intend to do the moderator mr. trewhitt a very brief question for president ford mr trewhitt mr. president if get the accounting of miss in action want from north|vietnam or from vietnam be sorry now would then be prepared to reopen negotiation for restoration of relation with that country the president let restate policy as long as vietnam north|vietnam do not give a full and complete accounting of missing in action will never go along with the admission of vietnam to the|united|nation if do give a bona fide complete accounting of the mia 's then believe that the|united|states should begin negotiation for the admission of vietnam to the|united|nation but not until have give the full accounting of mia 's the moderator governor carter mr carter of the most embarrassing failure of the ford administration and one that touch specifically on human right be refusal to appoint a presidential commission to go to vietnam to go to laos to go to cambodia and try to trade for the release of information about those who be miss in action in those war this be what the family of mia 's want so far mr. ford have not do have have several fragmentary effort by member of the congress and by private citizen several|months|ago the|vietnam|government say be ready to sit down and negotiate for release of information on mia 's so far mr. ford have not respond also would never formalize relationship with vietnam nor permit to join the|united|nation until have take this action but that be not enough need to have an active and aggressive action on the part of the president the leader of this country to seek out every possible way to get that information which have keep the mia family in despair and doubt and mr. ford have just not do the moderator thank governor carter that complete the questioning for this|evening each candidate now have up|to|3|minute for a close statement be determine by the toss of a coin that governor carter would take the first question and now go first with closing remark governor carter mr cater the purpose of this debate and the outcome of the election will determine basic thing leadership uphold the principle of country and proper priority

strip of friendship and ally hide behind a tight defense that have be draw in around because be fearful of the outside world will have a government of secrecy that exclude the american people from participation in make basic decision and therefore cover up mistake and make possible for government government to depart from the principle of constitution and bill of rights or will have a world of peace with the threat of atomic weapon eliminate with full trade with people at work inflation control openness in government people proud once again congress citizen president secretary of state work in harmony and unity toward a common future a world where people have enough to cat arid a world where care about those who do not can become a breadbasket of the world instead of the arm merchant of

time arrangement and question will continue to be alternate between the candidate each man will make a statement at the end governor carter to go first president ford and governor carter do not have any note or prepared remark with this|evening mr. reynolds question for governor carter mr reynolds mr. president governor carter governor in an interview with the|associated|press last|week say believe these debate would alleviate a lot of concern that some voter have about well of those concern not an uncommon one about candidate in any year be that many voter say do not really know where stand now have make job number priority and have say be commit to a drastic reduction in unemployment can say now governor in specific term what first step would be next|january if be elect to achieve that mr carter yes first of all be to recognize the tremendous economic strength of this country and to set the putting back to work of people as a top priority this be an effort that ought to be do primarily by strong leadership in the|white|house the inspiration of people the tapping of business agriculture industry labor and government at all level to work on this project will never have an end to the inflationary spiral and will never have a balanced budget until get people back to work there be several thing that can be do specifically that be not now be do first of all to channel research and development fund into area that will provide large number of job secondly need to have a commitment in the private sector to cooperate with government in matter like housing here a very small investment of taxpayer ' money in the housing field can bring large number of extra job in the guarantee of mortgage loan in the putting forward of program for housing for old people and so forth to cut down the roughly 20-percent unemployment that now exist in the construction industry another thing be to deal with need in the central city where the unemployment rate be extremely high sometimes among minority group those who do not speak english or who be black or young people a 40-percent unemployment here a ccc civilian|conservation corps]-type program would be appropriate to channel money into the sharing with private sector and also local and state government to employ young people who be now out of work another very important aspect of economy would be to increase production in every way possible to hold down taxis on individual and to shift the tax burden on to those who have avoid pay taxis in the past these kind of specific thing none of which be be do now would be a great help in reduce unemployment there be an additional factor that need to be do and cover very succinctly and that be to make sure that have a good relationship between management business on the hand and labor on the other in a lot of place where unemployment be very high may channel specific target job opportunity by pay part of the salary of unemployed people and also share with local government the payment of salary which would let cut down the unemployment rate much low before hit the inflationary level but believe that by the|end|of|the|first|4|year of the next term could have the unemployment rate down to adult unemployment which be about|4|to|4 percent overall a control inflation rate and have a balanced growth of about|4|to|6|percent around|5|percent which would give a balanced budget mr reynolds governor in the event be successful and do achieve a drastic drop in unemployment that be likely to create additional pressure on price how willing be to consider an income policy in other word wage and price control mr carter well now have such a low utilization of productive capacity about|73|percent think be about the low since the|great|depression year and such a high unemployment rate now-7.9 percent that have a long way to go in get people to work before have the inflationary pressure and think this would be easy to accomplish to get job now without have the strong inflationary pressure that would be necessary would not favor the payment of a give fix income to people unless be not able to work but with tax incentive for the low income group could build up income level above the poverty level and not make welfare more profitable than work the moderator mr. president response the president do not believe that mr. carter have be any more specific in this case than have be on many other instance notice particularly that do not endorse the humphrey hawkins bill which have on occasion and which be include as a part of the democratic platform that legislation allegedly would help unemployment but all know that would have control economy would have add each|year in additional expenditure by would have call for export control on agricultural product in judgment the good way to get job be to expand the private sector where out of job today exist in economy can do that by reduce federal taxis as propose about|a|year|ago when call for a tax reduction of quarter of to go to private taxpayer and quarter to the business sector could add to job in the major metropolitan area by a proposal that recommend that would give tax incentive to business to move into the inner city and to expand or to build new plant so that would take a plant or expand a plant where people be and people be currently unemployed could also help youth with some of the proposal that would give to young people an opportunity to work and learn at the same time just like give money to young people who be go to college those be the kind of specific that think have to discuss on these debate and these be the kind of program that will talk about on time the moderator mr. gannon question to president ford mr gannon mr. president would like to continue for a moment on this question of taxis which have just raise have say that favor more tax cut for middle income americans even those earn a year that presumably would cost the treasury quite a bit of money in lose revenue in view of the very large budget deficit that have accumulate and that be still in prospect how be possible to promise further tax cut and to reach goal of balance the budget the president at the time mr. gannon that make the recommendation for a tax cut quarter of to go to individual taxpayer and to american business say at the same time that have to hold the lid on federal spending that for every dollar of a tax reduction have to have an equal reduction in federal expenditure a for proposition and recommend that to the congress with a budget ceiling of and that would have permit to have a tax reduction in tax reduction program for middle income taxpayer recommend that the congress increase personal exemption from per person to per person that would mean of course that for a family of that that family would have more personal exemption money that could spend for own purpose money that the government would not have to spend but if keep the lid on federal spending which think can with the help of the congress can justify fully a tax reduction in the budget that submit to the congress in january|of|this|year recommend a 50-percent cutback in the rate of growth of federal spending for the|last|10|year the budget of the|united|state have grow from about|11|percent per year can not afford that kind of growth in federal spending and in the budget that recommend cut in half a growth rate of to 5|1/2|percent with that kind of limitation on federal spending can fully justify the tax reduction that have propose and seem to with the stimulant of more money in the hand of the taxpayer and with more money in the hand of business to expand to modernize to provide more job economy will be stimulate so that will get more revenue and will have a more prosperous economy mr gannon mr. president to follow up a moment the congress have pass a tax bill which be before now which do not meet exactly the sort of outline that request what be intention on that bill since do not meet requirement do plan to sign that bill the president that tax bill do not entirely meet the criterion that establish think the congress should have add another reduction in personal income taxis include the increase of personal exemption from to and congress could have do that if the budget committee of the congress and the congress as a whole have not increase the spending that recommend in the budget be sure know that in the resolution pass by the congress have add about|$17|billion in more spending by the congress over the budget that recommend so would prefer in that tax bill to have an additional tax cut and a further limitation on federal spending now this tax bill that have not reach the|white|house yet but be expect in a day or be about|1,500 page have some good provision in have leave out some that have recommend unfortunately on the other hand when have a bill of that magnitude with those many provision a president have to sit and decide if there be more good than bad and from the analysis that have make so far seem to that that tax bill do justify signature and approval the moderator governor carter response mr carter well mr. ford be change considerably previous philosophy the present tax structure be a disgrace to this country be just a welfare program for the rich as a matter of fact of the total tax deduction go for only|1|percent of the rich people in this country and of the tax credit go for the|14|percent of the rich people in this country when mr. ford first become president in august|of|1974 the first thing do in october be to ask for a increase in taxis on people in the midst of the heavy recession since the|great|depression|of|the|1940 's in january|of|1975 ask for a tax change a increase on low and middle income private individual a on the corporation and the special interest in december|of|1975 veto the roughly|$18|to|$20|billion tax reduction bill that have be pass by the congress and then come back later on in january|of|this|year and do advocate a tax reduction but would be offset by a increase this|coming|january in deduction for social security payment and for unemployment compensation the whole philosophy of include opponent have be to pile on taxis on low income people to take off on the corporation as a matter of fact since the|late|sixties when mr. nixon take office have have a reduction in the percentage of taxis pay by corporation from down to about|20|percent have have an increase in taxis pay by individual payroll taxis from up to this be what the republicans have do to this be why tax reform be so important the moderator mrs. drew question to governor carter ms draw governor carter have propose a number of new or enlarge program include job and health welfare reform child care aid to education aid to city change in social security and housing subsidy have also say that want to balance the budget by the end of first term now have not put a price tag on those program but even if price conservatively and count for full employment by the end of first term and count for the economic growth that would occur during that period there still be not enough money to pay for those program and balance the budget by any estimate that have be able to see so in that case what would give mr carter well as a matter of fact there be if assume a rate of growth of economy equivalent to what be during president johnson and president kennedy even before the vietnamese war and if assume that at the end of the period can cut unemployment rate down to to percent under those circumstance even assume no elimination of unnecessary program and assume an increase in the allotment of money to finance program increase as the inflation rate do economic project think confirm by the house and the senate committee have be with a extra amount of money that can be spend in fiscal|year ' 81-which would be the|last|year of this next term within that increase there would be fit the program that promise the american people may say too that if see that these goal can not be reach and believe be reasonable goal then would cut back on the rate of implementation of new program in order to accommodate a balanced budget by fiscal|year|'81 which be the|last|year of the next term believe that ought to have a balanced budget during normal economic circumstance and these projection have be very carefully make stand behind and if should be in error slightly on the down side then will phase in the program that have advocate more slowly ms. drew governor accord to the budget committee of the congress that refer to if get to full employment what project at a unemployment and as say even allow for the inflation in the program there would not be anything more than a surplus of by conservative estimate of program would be that would be about|$85|to|$100|billion so how do say that be go to be able to do these thing and balance the budget mr carter well the assumption that have describe that be different be in the rate of growth of economy ms draw no take that into account in those figure mr carter believe that be accurate to say that the committee to whom refer with the employment rate that state and with the to growth rate in economy that the projection would be a increase in the amount of money that have to spend in compare to now and in that framework would be fit any improvement in the program now this do not include any extra control over unnecessary spending the weeding out of obsolete or obsolescent program will have a safety version build in with complete reorganization of the executive branch of government which be pledge to do the present bureaucratic structure of the|federal|government be a mess and if be elect president that be go to be a top priority of mine to completely revise the structure of the|federal|government to make economical efficient purposeful and manageable for a change and also be go to institute base budgeting which use 4|year in georgia which assess every program every|year and eliminate those program that be obsolete or obsolescent but with these projection will have a balanced budget by fiscal|year if be elect president keep promise to the american people and be just predicate on very modest but think accurate projection of employment increase and a growth in national economy equal to what be experience under kennedy johnson before the vietnam war the moderator president ford the president if be true that there will be a surplus by fiscal|year|1981 rather than spend that money for all the new program that governor carter recommend and endorse and which be include in the democratic platform think the american taxpayer ought to get an additional tax break a tax reduction of that magnitude feel that the taxpayer be the one that need the relief do not think should add additional program of the magnitude that governor carter talk about seem to that tax structure today have rate that be too high but be very glad to point out have since during a republican administration have have people take off of the tax roll at the low end of the taxpayer area and at the same time assume that sign the tax bill that be mention by mr. gannon will in the last tax bill have increase the minimum tax on all wealthy taxpayer and believe that by eliminate taxpayer in the|last|8|years and by put a heavy tax burden on those in the high tax bracket plus the other action that have be take can give taxpayer adequate tax relief now seem to that as look at the recommendation of the budget committee and own projection there be not go to be any dividend have hear of those dividend in the past always happen expect at the time of the|vietnam|war but be use up before ever end the war and taxpayer never get the adequate relief deserve the moderator mr. reynolds mr reynolds mr. president when come into office speak very eloquently of the need for a time for healing and very early in administration go out to chicago and announce propose a program of case by case pardon for draft resister to restore to full citizenship some|14,000 young man take advantage of offer but another do not in grant the pardon to former president nixon sir part of rationale be to put watergate behind to if may quote again truly end long national nightmare why do not the same rationale apply now today in our|bicentennial|year to the young man who resist in vietnam and many of still in exile abroad the president the amnesty program that recommend in chicago in september|of|1974 would give to all draft evader and military deserter the opportunity to earn good record back about|14|to|15,000 do take advantage of that program give ample time be against an across the board pardon of draft evader or military deserter now in the case of mr. nixon the reason the pardon be give be that when take office this country be in a very very divided condition there be hatre there be divisiveness people have lose faith in government in many many respect mr. nixon resign and become president seem to that if be to adequately and effectively handle the problem of high inflation a grow recession the involvement of the|united|state still in vietnam that have to give of time to those major problem mr. nixon resign that be disgrace the first president out of that ever resign from public office under pressure so when look at the penalty that pay and when analyze the requirement that have to spend all of time work on the economy which be in trouble that inherit work on problem in southeast|asia which be still plague seem to that mr. nixon have be penalize enough by resignation in disgrace and the need and necessity for to concentrate on the problem of the country fully justify the action that take mr reynolds take then sir that do not believe that be go to reconsider and think about those who be still abroad have not be penalize enough many of have be there for year the president well mr. carter have indicate that would give a blanket pardon to all draft evader do not agree with that point of view give in an opportunity for all draft evader all deserter to come in voluntarily clear record by earn an opportunity to restore good citizenship think give a good opportunity do not think should go any further the moderator governor carter mr carter well think be very difficult for president ford to explain the difference between the pardon of president nixon and attitude toward those who violate the draft law as a matter of fact now do not advocate amnesty advocate pardon there be a difference in opinion and in accordance with the ruling of the|supreme|court and in accordance with the definition in the dictionary amnesty mean that what do be right pardon mean that what do whether be right or wrong be forgive for and do advocate a pardon for draft evader think be accurate to say that 2|years|ago when mr. ford put in this amnesty that time as many deserter be excuse as be the one who evade the draft but think that now be the time to heal country after the vietnam war and think that what the people be concerned about be not the pardon or the amnesty of those who evade the draft but whether or not crime system be fair have get a sharp distinction draw between white collar crime the big shot who be rich who be influential very seldom go to jail those who be poor and who have no influence quite often be the one who be punish and the whole subject of crime be that concern people very much and believe that the fairness of be what be the major problem that address leader and this be something that have not be address adequately by this administration but hope to have a complete responsibility on shoulder to help bring about a fair criminal justice system and also to bring about an end to the divisiveness that have occur in country as a result of the|vietnam|war the moderator mr. gannon mr gannon governor carter have promise a sweeping overhaul of the|federal|government include a reduction in the number of government agency say would go down to about|200 from some|1,900 that sound indeed like a very deep cut in but be not a fact that be not really talk about few federal employee or less government spending but rather that be talk about reshape not make small mr carter well have be through this before mr. gannon as the governor of georgia when take over have a bureaucratic mess like have in washington now and have agency department bureaus commission some fully budget some not but all have responsibility to carry out that be in conflict and cut those agency and so forth down substantially eliminate of set up a simple structure of government that could be administer fairly and be a tremendous success have not be undo since be there result also in an ability to reshape court system prison system education system mental health program and a clear assignment of responsibility and authority and also to have people once again understand and control government intend to do the same thing if be elect president when get to washington come in as an outsider of the major responsibility that will have on shoulder be a complete reorganization of the executive branch of government now have a greatly expand white|house staff when mr. nixon go in office for instance have spend on the|white|house and staff that have escalate now to in the last republican administration this need to be change need to put the responsibility back on the cabinet member also need to have a great reduction in agency and program for instance now have in the health area different program administer by major department and agency other advisory commission be responsible for this medicaid be in agency medicare be in a different the check on the quality of health care be in a different none of be responsible for health care this make almost impossible for to have a good health program have just advocate this|past|week a consolidation of the responsibility for energy country now have no comprehensive energy program or policy have different agency in the|federal|government responsible for the production the regulation the information about energy the conservation of energy spread all over government this be a gross waste of money so tough competent management of government give a simple efficient purposeful and manageable government will be a great step forward and if be elect and intend to be then be go to be do mr gannon well would like to press question on the number of federal employee whether would really plan to reduce the overall number or merely put in different department and relabel in energy plan consolidate a number of agency into or would but do that really change the overall mr carter can not say for sure that would have few federal employee when go out of office than when come in take about|3|years to completely reorganize the georgia government the|last|year be in office budget be actually less than be a|year|before which show a great improvement also have a increase in the number of employee the|last|year but be a tremendous shift from administrative job into the delivery of service for instance completely revise prison system establish new mental health treatment center and shift people out of administrative job into the field to deliver well service the same thing will be do at the federal|government level accomplish this with substantial reduction in employee in some department for instance in the|transportation|department cut back about|25|percent of the total number of employee in give people well mental health care increase the number of employee but the efficiency of the simplicity of the ability of people to understand own government and control be a substantial benefit derive from complete reorganization have get to do this at the federal|government level if do not the bureaucratic mess be go to continue there be no way for people now to understand what government be there be no way to get the answer to a question when come to washington to try to as a governor to try to begin a new program for people like the treatment of drug addict find there be different federal agency that have to go to to manage the drug treatment program in the georgia government only have agency responsible for drug treatment this be the kind of change that would be make and would be of tremendous benefit in long range planning in tight budgeting save the taxpayer ' money make the government more efficient cut down on bureaucratic waste have a clear delineation of authority and responsibility of employee and give people a well chance to understand and control government the moderator president ford the president think the record should show mr. newman that the|bureau|of|census check just yesterday indicate that in that governor carter be governor of the state of georgia expenditure by the government go up over|50|percent employee of the government in georgia during term of office go up over|25|percent and the figure also show that the bond indebtedness of the state of georgia during governorship go up and there be some very interesting testimony give by governor carter 's successor governor busbee before a senate committee a|few|months|ago on how find the medicaid program when come into office follow governor carter testify and these be word the present governor of georgia say find the medicaid program in georgia in shamble now let talk about what have do in the|white|house as far as federal employee be concern the first order that issue after become president be to cut or eliminate the prospective increase in federal employee that have be schedule by predecessor and in the term that have be president some|2|years have reduce federal employment by in the white|house staff when become president have roughly|540 employee now have about|485 employee so have make a rather significant reduction in the number of employee on the white|house staff work for the president so think record of cut back employee plus the failure on the part of the governor 's program to actually save employment in georgia show which be the well plan the moderator mrs. drew ms. drew mr. president at vail after the republican convention announce that would now emphasize new area among those be job and housing and health improve recreational facility for americans and also add crime also mention education for have be tell that could not do very much in these area because could not afford and in fact do have a deficit now in rebuttal to governor carter a little bit earlier say that if there be to be any surplus in the|next|few|year think should be turn back to the people in the form of tax relief so how be go to pay for any new initiative in these area announce at vail be go to now stress the president well in the|last|2|years as indicate before have a very tough time be face with heavy inflation over be face with substantial unemployment but in the|last|24|months have turn the economy around and have bring inflation down to under|6|percent and have add employment of about|4|million in the|last|17|month to the point where have people work in america today the most in the history of the country the net result be be go to have some improvement in receipt and think will have some decrease in disbursement expect to have a low deficit in fiscal|year|1978 feel that with this improvement in the economy feel with more receipt and few disbursement can in a moderate way increase as recommend over the|next|10|year a new park program that would cost a|billion|and|a|half|dollars double national park system have recommend that in the housing program can reduce down payment and moderate monthly payment but that do not cost any more as far as the|federal|treasury be concern believe that can do a well job in the area of crime but that require tough sentencing mandatory certain prison sentence for those who violate criminal law believe that can revise the|federal|criminal|code which have not be revise in a|good|many|years that do not cost any more money believe that can do something more effectively with a moderate increase in money in the drug abuse program feel that in education can have a slight increase not a major increase be understanding that governor carter have indicate that approve of a expenditure by as far as education be concern at the present time be spend roughly|$3,500|million do not know where that money would come from but as look at the quality of life program job health education crime recreation feel that as move forward with a healthy economy can absorb the small necessary cost that will be require ms. drew but sir in the|next|few|year would try to reduce the deficit would spend money for these program that have just outline or would as say earlier return whatever surplus get to the people in the form of tax relief the president feel that with the program that have recommend tax cut with the moderate increase in the quality of life area can still have a balanced budget which will submit to the congress in january|of|1978 will not wait or longer as governor carter indicate as the economy improve and be improve gross national product this|year will average about increase over last|year will have a low rate of inflation for the|calendar|year|this|year something slightly under employment will be up revenue will be up will keep the lid on some of these program that can hold down as have a little extra money to spend for those quality of life program which think be need and necessary now can not and would not endorse the kind of program that governor carter recommend endorse the democratic platform which as read call for approximately additional program estimate that those program would add minimum and probably maximum each|year to the federal budget those program can not afford and give tax relief feel that can hold the line and restrain federal spending give a tax reduction and still have a balanced budget by the moderator governor carter mr carter well mr. ford take the same attitude that the republicans always take in the|last|3|months before an election be always for the program that fight the other 3|1/2|year remember when herbert|hoover be against job for people remember when all landon be against social security and later president nixon-16 year ago be tell the public that john|kennedy 's proposal would bankrupt the country and would double the cost the good thing to do be to look at the record of mr. ford 's administration and mr. nixon 's before have last|year a deficit the large deficit in the history of country more of a deficit spending than have in the entire period under president johnson and president kennedy have get more americans out of job today than be out of work and since mr. ford have be in office in have have a 50-percent increase in unemployment from people out of work to more people out of work or a total of 7|1/2|million have also get a comparison between and mr. nixon be get time the size of the deficit that mr. nixon even have this talk about more people at work be distort because with the 14-percent increase in the cost of live in the|last|2|years mean that woman and young people have have to go to work when do not want to because father could not make enough to pay the increase cost of food and housing and clothing have in this|last|2|years|alone total deficit under president ford and at the same time have have in the|last|8|years a doubling in the number of bankruptcy for small business have have a negative growth in national economy measure in real dollar the take home pay of a worker in this country be actually less now than be in measure in real dollar this be the kind of record that be there and talk about the future and a drastic change or conversion on the part of mr. ford at the|last|minute be one that just do not go the moderator mr. reynolds mr reynolds governor carter would like to turn to what use to call the energy crisis yesterday a british|government commission on air pollution but head by a nuclear physicist recommend that any further expansion of nuclear energy be delay in britain as long as possible now this be a subject that be quite controversial among own people and there seem to be a clear difference between and the president on the use of nuclear power plant which say would use as a last priority why sir be unsafe mr carter well among other experience in the past have be a nuclear engineer and do graduate work in this field think know the capability and limitation of atomic power but the energy policy of nation be that have not yet be establish under this administration think almost every other develop nation in the world have an energy policy except have see the|federal|energy|agency administration establish for instance in the crisis of be suppose to be a temporary agency now be permanent be enormous be grow every day and think the|wall|street|journal report not too long ago have public relation expert work for the|federal|energy|agency administration to try to justify to the american people own existence have get to have a firm way to handle the energy question the reorganization proposal that have put forward be first step in addition to that need to have a realization that have get about|35|year worth of oil leave in the whole world be go to run out of oil when mr. nixon make famous speech on operation independence be import about|35|percent of oil now have increase that amount now import about|44|percent of oil need a shift from oil to coal need to concentrate research and development effort on coal burning and extraction that be safe for miner that also be clean burning need to shift very strongly toward solar energy and have strict conservation measure and then as a last resort only continue to use atomic power would certainly not cut out atomic power altogether can not afford to give up that opportunity until later but to the extent that continue to use atomic power would be responsible as president to make sure that the safety precaution be initiate and maintain for instance some that have be forget need to have the reactor core below ground level the entire powerplant that use atomic power tightly seal and a heavy vacuum maintain there ought to be a standardized design there ought to be a full time atomic energy specialist independent of the power company in the control room full time a day to shut down a plant if an abnormality develop these kind of procedure along with evacuation procedure adequate insurance ought to be initiate so shift from oil to coal emphasize research and development on coal use and also on solar power strict conservation measure not yield every time the special interest group put pressure on the president like this administration have do and use atomic energy only as a last resort with the strict possible safety precaution that be the good overall energy policy in the brief time have to discuss mr reynolds well governor on the same subject would require mandatory conservation effort to try to conserve fuel mr carter yes would some of the thing that can be do about this be a change in the rate structure of electric power company now encourage people to waste electricity by give the low rate to the big user do not do anything to cut down on peak load requirement do not have an adequate requirement for the insulation of home for the efficiency of automobile and whenever the automobile manufacturer come forward and say can not meet the limit that the congress have put forward this republican administration have delay the implementation date in addition to that ought to have a shift to the use of coal particularly in the appalachian region where the coal be locate a lot of very high quality low carbon coal mean low sulfur coal be there be where employment be need this would help a great deal so mandatory conservation measure yes encouragement by the president for people to voluntarily conserve yes and also the private sector ought to be encourage to bring forward to the public the benefit from efficiency bank in washington for instance give low interest loan for people who adequately insulate home or who buy efficient automobile and some major manufacturing company like dow|chemical have through very effective efficiency mechanism cut down the use of energy by as|much|as|40|percent with the same out product these kind of thing ought to be do ought to be encourage and support and even require by the government yes the moderator president ford the president governor carter skim over a very serious and a very broad subject in january|of|1975 submit to the congress and to the american people the first comprehensive energy program recommend by any president call for an increase in the production of energy in the|united|state call for conservation measure so that would save the energy that have if be go to increase domestic oil and gas production and have to have to give to those producer an opportunity to develop land or well recommend to the congress that should increase coal production in this country from a year to by in order to do that have to improve extraction of coal from the ground have to improve utilization of coal make more efficient make clean in addition have to expand research and development in program for energy independence have increase for example solar energy research from about|$84|million a year to about|$120|million a year be go as fast as the expert say should in nuclear power have increase the research and development under the|energy|research|and|development|agency administration very substantially to ensure that nuclear power plant be safe that be more efficient and that have adequate safeguard think have to have great oil and gas production more coal production more nuclear production and in addition have to have energy conservation the moderator mr. gannon mr gannon mr. president would like to return for a moment to this problem of unemployment have veto or threaten to veto a number of job bill pass or in development in the democratic control congress yet at the same time the government be pay out think be perhaps a year in unemployment compensation cause by the high unemployment why do think be well to pay out unemployment compensation to idle people than to put to work in public service job the president the bill that have veto the for an|additional|$6|billion be not a bill that would have solve unemployment problem even the proponent of admit that no|more|than|400,000 job would be make available analysis indicate that something in the magnitude of about|150|to|200,000 job would be make available each of those job would have cost the taxpayer in addition the job would not be available right now would not have materialize for about|9|to|18|months the immediate problem have be to stimulate economy now so that can get rid of unemployment what have do be to hold the lid on spending in an effort to reduce the rate of inflation and have prove think very conclusively that can reduce the rate of inflation and increase job for example as have say have add some|4|million job in the|last|17|month have now employ people in america the large number in the history of the|united|state have add job in the|last|2|months inflation be the quick way to destroy job and by hold the lid on federal spending have be able to do a good job an affirmative job in inflation and as a result have add to the job in this country think be also appropriate to point out that through tax policy have stimulate add employment throughout the country the investment tax credit the tax incentive for expansion and modernization of industrial capacity be opinion that the private sector where out of the job be where have permanent job with the opportunity for advancement be a well place than make work job under the program recommend by the congress mr gannon just to follow up mr. president the congress have just pass a appropriation bill which would provide money for the public work job program that earlier try to kill by veto of the authorization legislation in light of the fact that unemployment again be rise or have in the|past|3|months wonder if have rethink that question at all whether would consider allow this program to be fund or will veto that money bill the president well that bill have not yet come down to the|oval|office so be not in a position to make any judgment on tonight but that be an extra that would add to the deficit which would add to the inflationary pressure which would help to destroy job in the private sector not make job where the job really be these make work temporary job dead end as be be not the kind of job that want for people think be interesting to point out that in the|2|year that have be president have veto bill congress have sustain veto as a result have save over|$9|billion in federal expenditure and the congress by override the bill that do veto the congress have add some|$13|billion to the federal expenditure and to the federal deficit now governor carter complain about the deficit that this administration have have and yet condemn the veto that have make that have save the taxpayer and could have save an|additional|$13|billion now can not have both way and therefore seem to that should hold the lid as have to the good of ability so can stimulate the private economy and get the job where the job be out of in this economy the moderator governor carter mr carter well mr. ford do not seem to put into perspective the fact that when more people be out of work then there be where have more people out of work than be when take office that this touch human being be in a city in pennsylvania not too long ago near here and there be about|4,000 or people in the audience be on a train trip and say how many adult here be out of work about|a|thousand raise hand mr. ford actually have few people now in the private sector in nonfarm job than when take office and still talk about a success unemployment be a terrible tragedy in this country say have learn how to match unemployment with inflation that be right have get the high inflation have have in right now except under this administration and that be and have get the high unemployment have have under mr. ford 's administration since the|great|depression this affect human being and insensitivity in provide those people a chance to work have make this a welfare administration and not a work administration have not save with veto have only be a net saving of and the cost in unemployment compensation welfare compensation and lose revenue have increase in the|last|2|years this be a typical attitude that really cause havoc in people 's life and then be cover over by say that country have naturally get a unemployment rate or unemployment rate and a inflation be a travesty show a lack of leadership and have never have a president since the states that veto more bill mr. ford have veto time as many bill as mr. nixon per year and of have be override of bill that be override only get vote in the senate and vote in the house from republicans so this show a breakdown in leadership the moderator governor carter under the rule must stop mrs. draw ms draw governor carter would like to come back to the subject of taxis have say that want to cut taxis for the middle- and low income group mr carter right ms draw but unless be willing to do such thing as reduce the itemize deduction for charitable contribution or home mortgage payment or interest or taxis or capital gain can not really raise sufficient revenue to provide an overall tax cut of any size so how be go to provide that tax relief that be talk about mr carter now have such a grossly unbalanced tax system as say earlier that be a disgrace of all the tax benefit now of go to of the rich people in this country over percent-53 to be exact percent of the tax benefit go to the rich people in this country have have a 50-percent increase in payroll deduction since mr. nixon go in office 8|years|ago mr. ford have advocate since have be in office over|$5|billion in reduction for corporation special interest group and the very very wealthy who derive income not from labor but from investment that have get to be change a few thing that can be do have now a deferral system so that the multinational corporation who invest overseas if make in profit overseas do not have to pay any of taxis unless bring money back into this country where do not pay taxis the average american pay taxis for not only that but rob this country of job because instead of come back with that million|dollars and create a shoe factory say in new|hampshire or vermont if the company take the money down to italy and build a shoe factory do not have to pay any taxis on the money another thing be a system call disc domestic|international|sales|corporation which be originally design and propose by mr. nixon to encourage export this permit a company to create a dummy corporation to export product and then not to pay the full amount of taxis on this cost government about|$1.4|billion a year and when those rich corporation do not pay that tax the average american taxpayer pay for another one that be very important be the business deduction jet airplane first class travel the martini lunch the average work person can not take advantage of that but the wealthy people can another system be where a dentist can invest money in say raise cattle and can put in of own money borrow that make a and mark off a great amount of loss through that procedure there be example for instance where somebody produce pornographic movie put in of own money and get in tax saving these special kind of program have rob the average taxpayer and have benefit those who be powerful and who can employ lobbyist and who can have c.p.a. 's and lawyer to help benefit from the roughly|8,000 page of the tax code the average american person can not do can not hire a lobbyist out of unemployment compensation check ms draw governor to follow up on answer in order for any kind of tax relief to really be feel by the middle- and low income people accord to congressional committee on this need about|$10|billion now list some thing the deferral on foreign income be estimate would save about|$500|million disc say be the estimate of the outside if eliminate all tax shelter be so where else would raise the revenue to provide this tax relief would in fact do away with all business deduction and what other kind of preference would do away with mr carter no would not do away with all business deduction think that would be a very serious mistake but if could just do away with the one that be unfair could lower taxis for everyone would never do anything that would increase the taxis for those who work for a living or who be presently require to list all income what want to do be not to raise taxis but to eliminate loophole and this be the point of first statistic that give that the present tax benefit that have be carve out over a long period of years-50 year by sharp tax lawyer and by lobbyist have benefit just the rich these program that describe to earlier the tax deferral for overseas the disc and the tax shelter only apply to people in the year bracket or up and think this be the good way to approach be to make sure that everybody pay taxis on the income that earn and make sure that take whatever saving there be from the high income level and give to the low and middle income family the moderator president ford the president governor carter 's answer tonight do not coincide with the answer that give in an interview to the|associated|press a|week|or|so|ago in that interview governor carter indicate that would raise the taxis on those in the medium- or middle income bracket or high now if take the medium- or middle income taxpayer that be per person governor carter have indicate publicly in an interview that would increase the taxis on about|50|percent of the work people of this country think the way to get tax equity in this country be to give tax relief to the middle income people who have an income from roughly|$8,000 up to or have be shortchange as have take taxpayer off the tax roll in the|last|8|years and as have add to the minimum tax provision to make all people pay more taxis believe in tax equity for the middle income taxpayer increase the personal exemption mr. carter want to increase taxis for roughly|half of the taxpayer of this country now the governor have also play a little fast and loose with the fact about veto the record show that president roosevelt veto on an average of bill a year president truman veto on the average while be president about|38 bill a year understand that governor carter when be governor of georgia veto between|35|and|40 bill a year average in be but in the process of that have save and final comment governor carter talk about the tax bill and all of the inequity that exist in the present law must remind the democrats have control the congress for the|last|22|year and write all the tax bill the moderator mr. reynolds mr reynolds suspect that could continue on this tax argument for some time but would like to move on to another area mr. president everybody seem to be run against washington this|year and would like to raise coincidental event then ask whether think perhaps this may have a bearing on the attitude throughout the country the|house|ethics|committee have just now end investigation of daniel|schorr after several|month and many thousands|of|dollar try to find out how obtain and cause to be publish a report of the congress that probably be the property of the american people at the same time the|senate|select|committee|on|standards|and|conduct have vote not really to begin an investigation of a|united|states senator because of allegation against that may have be receive corporate fund illegally do suppose sir that event like this contribute to the feeling in the country that maybe there be something wrong in washington and do not mean just in the executive branch but throughout the whole government the president there be a considerable anti - washington feeling throughout the country but think the feeling be misplace in the|2|year have restore integrity in the|white|house and have set high standard in the executive branch of the government the anti - washington feeling in opinion ought to be focus on the|congress|of|the|united|state for example this congress very shortly will spend a|billion|dollars a year for housekeeping salary expense and the like the next congress will probably be the first dollar congress in the history of the|united|state do not think the american people be get money 's worth from the majority party that run this congress in addition see that in the|last|4|years the number of employee hire by the congress have go up substantially much more than the gross national product much more than any other increase throughout society congress be hire people by the drove and the cost as a result have go up and do not see any improvement in the performance of the congress under the present leadership so seem to instead of the anti - washington feeling be aim at everybody in washington seem to that the focus should be where the problem be which be and particularly the majority in the congress spend too much money on have too many employee there be some question about morality seem to that in this election the focus should not be on the executive branch but the correction should come as the voter for member of the|house|of|representatives or for united|states senator that be where the problem be and hope there will be some corrective action take so can get some new leadership in mr reynolds mr. president if may follow up think have make plain that take a dim view of the majority in the congress be not quite likely sir that will have a democratic congress in the next session if be elect president and have not the country a right to ask whether can get along with that congress or whether will have continue confrontation the president well seem to that have a chance the republicans to get a majority in the|house|of|representatives will make some gain in the|united|states|senate so there will be different ratio in the house as well as in the senate and as president will be able to work with that congress but let take the other side of the coin if may suppose have have a democratic congress for the|last|2|years and have have governor carter as president have in effect say that would agree with all of would disapprove of the veto that have make and would have add significantly to expenditure and the deficit in think would be contrary to of the basic concept in system of government a system of check and balance have a democratic congress today and fortunately have have a republican president to check excess with veto if have a democratic congress next|year and a president who want to spend an|additional|$100|billion a year or maybe a year with more program will have in judgment great deficit with more spending more danger of inflation think the american people want a republican president to check on any excess that come out of the next congress if be a democratic congress the moderator governor carter mr carter well be not a matter of republican and democrat be a matter of leadership or no leadership president eisenhower work with a democratic congress very well even president nixon because be a strong leader at least work with a democratic congress very well mr. ford have veto as say earlier time as many bill per year as mr. nixon mr. ford quite often put forward a program just as a public relation stunt and never try to put through the congress by work with the congress think under president nixon and eisenhower pass about|60 to percent of legislation this|year mr. ford will not pass more|than|26|percent of all the legislative proposal put forward this be government by stalemate and have see almost a complete breakdown in the proper relationship between the president who represent this country and the congress who collectively also represent this country have have republican president before who have try to run against a democratic congress and do not think it's the congress be mr. ford 's opponent but if insist that be responsible for the|democratic|congress of which have not be a part then think be only fair that be responsible for the nixon administration in entirety of which be a part that think be a good balance but the point be that a president ought to lead this country mr. ford so far as know except for avoid another watergate have not accomplish single major program for country and there have be a constant squabbling between the president and the congress and that be not the way this country ought to be run may go back to other thing mr. ford have misquote an ap news story that be in error to begin with that story report several time that would lower taxis for lower- and middle income family and that correction be deliver to the|white|house and be sure that the president know about this correction but still insist on repeat an erroneous statement the moderator president ford governor carter no longer have enough time for complete sequence of question have only|about|6|minutes leave for question and answer for that reason will drop the follow up question at this point but each candidate will still be able to respond to the other 's answer to the extent that can gentleman please keep remark brief mr gannon governor carter important part of the government 's economic policy apparatus have not talk about be the|federal|reserve|board would like to ask something about what have say and that be that believe that a president ought to have a chairman of the|federal|reserve|board whose view be compatible with own base on the record of the|last|few|year would say that view be compatible with those of chairman arthur|burns and if not would seek resignation if be elect mr carter what have say be that the president ought to have a chance to appoint the chairman of the|federal|reserve|board to have a coterminus term in other word both of serve the same 4|year the congress can modify the supply of money by modify the income tax law the president can modify the economic structure of the country by public statement and general attitude and the budget that propose the|federal|reserve have an independent status that ought to be preserve think that mr. burns do take a typical erroneous republican attitude in the|1973|year when inflation be so high assume that the inflation rate be because of excessive demand and therefore put into effect tight constraint on the economy very high interest rate which be typical also of a republican administration try to increase the tax payment by individual cut the tax payment by corporation would have do opposite think the problem should have be address by increase productivity by have put people back to work so could purchase more good low income taxis on individual perhaps raise if necessary on corporation in comparison but mr. burns in that respect make a very serious mistake would not want to destroy the independence of the|federal|reserve|board but do think ought to have a cohesive economic policy with at least the chairman of the|federal|reserve|board and the president 's term be the same and let the congress of course be the third entity with independence subject only to the president 's veto the moderator president ford response the president the chairman of the|federal|reserve|board should be independent fortunately have be during democratic as well as republican administration as a result in the|last|2|years have have a responsible monetary policy the federal reserve board indicate that the supply of money would be hold between to and and have do a good job in integrate the money supply with the fiscal policy of the executive and legislative branch of the government would be catastrophic if the chairman of the|federal|reserve|board become the tool of the political party that be in power be important for future economic security that that job be nonpolitical and separate from the executive and the legislative branch the moderator mrs. drew ms. drew mr. president the real problem with the fbi in fact all of the intelligence agency be there be no real law govern such law as there be tend to be vague and open ended now have issue some executive order but have learn that leave these agency to executive discretion and direction can get and in fact the country in a great deal of trouble president may be a decent man the next one may not be so what do think about try to write in some more protection by get some law govern these agency the president be familiar of course with the fact that be the first president in who have reorganize the intelligence agency in the cia the|defense|intelligence|agency the|national|security|agency and the other have do that by executive order and think have tighten up have straighten out problem that develop over the|last|few|year do not seem to that be need or necessary to have legislation in this particular regard have recommend to the congress however i'm sure be familiar with this legislation that would make very proper and in the right way that the attorney general could go in and get the right for wiretappe under security case this be an effort that be make by the attorney general and work with the congress but even in this area where think new legislation would be justify the congress have not respond so feel in that case as well as in the reorganization of the intelligence agency as have do have to do by executive order and be glad that have a good director in george|bush have good executive order and the cia and the dia and nsa be now do a good job under proper supervision the moderator governor carter mr carter well of the very serious thing that be happen in government in recent|years and have continue up until now be a breakdown in the trust among people in the at this point there be an audio failure which cause a delay in the debate until the moderator lady and gentleman probably be not necessary for to say that have a technical failure during the debate be not a failure in the debate be a failure in the broadcasting of the debate occur the fault have be deal with and want to thank president ford and governor carter for be so patient and understanding while this delay go on very much regret the technical failure that lose the sound as be leave the theatre occur during governor carter 's response to what would have be and what be the last question put to the candidate that question go to president ford deal with the control of government intelligence agency governor carter be make response and have very nearly finish will conclude that response now after which president ford and governor carter will make closing statement mr carter there have be too much government secrecy and not enough respect for the personal privacy of american citizen the moderator be now time for the closing statement which be to be up|to|4|minute long governor carter by the same toss of the coin that direct the first question to be to go first now mr carter well tonight have bad a chance to talk a lot about the past but think be time to talk about the future nation in the|last|8|years have be divide as never before be a time for unity be time to draw together to have a president and a congress that can work together with mutual respect for a change cooperate for a change in the open for a change so the people can understand own government be time for government industry and labor manufacturing agriculture education other entity in society to cooperate and be a time for government to understand and to cooperate with people for a long time american citizen have be exclude sometimes mislead sometimes have be lie to this be not compatible with the purpose of nation believe in country need to be competent the government need to be well manage efficient economical need to have a government that be sensitive to people 's need to those who be poor who do not have adequate health care who have be cheat too long by tax program who have be out of job whose family have be tear apart need to restore the faith and the trust of the american people in own government in addition to that have suffer because have not have leadership in this administration have get a government of stalemate have lose the vision of what country can and ought to be this be not the america that have know in the past be not the america that have to have in the future do not claim to know all the answer but have get confidence in country economic strength be still there system of government in spite of vietnam cambodia cia watergate be still the good system of government on earth and the great resource of all be the americans who still have within the strength the character the intelligence the experience the patriotism the idealism the compassion the sense of brotherhood on

strength in this country that can once again have a government as good as people and let the world know what still know and hope for that still live in the great and the strong and the good country on earth the moderator president ford the president on november|2 all of will make a very very important decision of the major issue in this campaign be trust a president should never promise more than can deliver and a president should always deliver everything that have promise a president can not be all thing to all people a president should be the same thing to all people another issue in this

quickly trample on sound principle of restraint and endanger the right of individual unbalance economic system by the huge and unprecedented growth of federal expenditure and borrowing and be not totally honest with about how much these program would cost and how would pay for finally shift emphasis from defense to domestic problem while adversary continue a massive buildup of arm the time

not only sound active government but also a much more vigorous healthy economy that can create new job and hold down price must introduce a new balance in the relationship between the individual and the government a balance that favor great individual freedom and self reliance must strike a new balance in system of federalism a balance that favor great responsibility and freedom for the leader of state and local government must introduce a new balance between the spending on domestic program and spend on defense a balance that ensure will fully meet obligation to the needy while also protect

by other if choose to sell to at all in and a half year will be twice as vulnerable to a foreign oil embargo as be two|winters|ago be now pay out a year for foreign oil five|years|ago pay out only|$3|billion annually five|years|from|now if do nothing who know how many more billion will be flow out of the|united|state these be not just american dollar these be american job four|months|ago send the congress this draft of detailed legislation plus some additional tax proposal program be design to conserve the energy now have while at the same time speed up the development and production of new domestic energy although this would increase the cost of energy until new supply be fully tap those dollar would remain in this country and would be return to own economy through tax cut and rebate ask the congress in january to enact this urgent 10-year program for energy independence within that is by mid - april in the meantime to get thing go say would use the standby presidential authority grant by the congress to reduce use of foreign petroleum by raise import fee on each barrel of crude oil by on february|1 another dollar on march|1 and a third on april|1 as soon as congress act on comprehensive energy program promise to take off these import fee impose the first dollar on oil import february|1 make appropriate exemption for hardship situation now what do the congress do in february about energy congress do nothing nothing that is except rush through legislation suspend for authority to impose any import fee on foreign oil congress need time say at the|end|of|february the democratic leader of the house and senate and other member concern with energy come to the|white|house give this pamphlet outline energy goal similar to and promise to come up with a congressional

program by then say go ahead and put on request stretch original deadline by a|couple|of|week but want to be reasonable want to be cooperative so in veto bill to restrict the president 's authority agree to request for a delay before take the next step under energy plan what do the congress do in march what do the congress do in april about energy congress do nothing in fairness must say there be diligent effort by some member democrats as well as republicans â€” to fashion meaningful energy legislation in subcommittee and committee administration work very hard with to bring a real energy independence bill to a vote at the|end|of|april the deadline set by the congressional leader defer for still another|30|day the second fee on import oil even then still hope for positive congressional action so what have the congress do in may about energy congress do nothing and go home for a recess april may â€” as of now the congress have do nothing positive to end energy dependence on the contrary have take negative action the first an attempt to prevent the president from do anything on own the second to pass a strip mining bill which would reduce domestic coal production instead of increase put thousand of people out of work needlessly increase the cost of energy to consumer raise electric bill for many and compel to import more foreign oil not less be force to veto this anti - energy bill last|week because will not be responsible for take step backward on energy when the congress will not take step forward on energy the congress have concentrate attention on conservation measure such as a high gasoline tax the congress have do little or nothing to stimulate production of new energy source here at home at elk|hills|naval|petroleum|reserve in california see oil well wait to produce a day if the congress would change the law to permit there be untold millions|of|barrel more in alaskan petroleum reserve and under the|continental|shelf could save a day if only the congress would allow more electric powerplant to substitute american coal for foreign oil peaceful atomic power which pioneer be advance faster abroad than at home still the congress do nothing about energy be today bad off than be in january domestic oil production be go down down down natural gas production be start to dwindle and many area face severe shortage next|winter coal production be still at the level of the 's foreign oil supplier be consider another price increase could go on and on but know the fact this country need to regain independence from foreign source of energy and the sooner the well there be no visible energy shortage now but could have do not have an energy crisis but may have next|winter do have an energy problem a very grave problem but one can still manage and solve if be successful internationally and can act decisively domestically four|month be already lose the congress have act only negatively must now do what can do as president first will impose an|additional|$1 import fee on foreign crude oil and on refined product effective june|1 give the congress plus an|extra|30|days to do something but nothing have be do since january high fee will further discourage the consumption of import fuel and may generate some constructive action when the congress come back second as direct on april|30 the|federal|energy|administration have complete public hearing on decontrol of old domestic oil will submit a decontrol plan to congress shortly after reconvene along with will urge the congress to pass a windfall profit tax with a plowback provision these measure would prevent unfair gain by oil company from decontrol price furnish a substantial incentive to increase domestic energy production and encourage conservation when talk about energy be talk about job american economy run on energy no energy no job in the long run be just that simple the sudden fourfold increase in foreign oil price and the embargo help to throw into this recession be on way out of this recession another oil embargo could throw back can not continue to depend on the price and supply whim of other the congress can not drift dawdle and debate forever with america 's future need help to energize this congress into comprehensive action will continue to press for january program which be still the only total energy program there be can not sit here

nation know firsthand that the congress have be a partner in the development and in the support of american foreign policy which president before have carry forward with change of course but not of destination the course which country choose in the world today have never be of great significance for as a nation and for all mankind build from a solid foundation alliance with great industrial democracy in europe north|america and japan remain strong with a great degree of consultation and equity than ever before with the|soviet|union have move across a broad front toward a more stable if still competitive relationship have begin to control the spiral of strategic nuclear armament after two|decade of mutual estrangement have achieve an historic opening with

american people can be proud of what nation have achieve and help other to accomplish but have from time to time suffer setback and disappointment in foreign policy some be event over which have no control some be difficulty impose upon live in a time of testing and of a time of change world a world of economic uncertainty political unrest and threat to the peace do not allow the luxury of abdication or domestic discord recall quite vividly the word of president truman to the congress when the|united|state face a far great challenge at the end of the|second|world|war if may quote if falter in leadership may endanger the peace of the world and shall surely endanger the welfare of this nation president truman 's resolution must guide today purpose be not to point the finger of blame but to build upon many success to repair damage where find to recover balance to move ahead as a united people tonight be a time for straight talk among friend about where stand and where be go a vast human tragedy have befall friend in vietnam and cambodia tonight shall not talk only of obligation arise from legal document who can forget the enormous sacrifice of blood dedication and treasure that make in vietnam under president and congresses the|united|state be engage in indochina million of americans serve thousand die and many more be wound imprison or lose over have be appropriate for that war by the|congress|of|the|united|state and after year of effort negotiate under the most difficult circumstance a settlement which make possible for to remove military force and bring home with pride american prisoner this settlement if term have be adhere to would have permit south|vietnamese ally with material and moral support to maintain security and rebuild after two|decade of war the chance for an endure peace after the last american fighting man leave vietnam in rest on publicly state premise first that if necessary the|united|states would help sustain the term of the paris accord sign and second that the|united|states would provide adequate economic and military assistance to south|vietnam let refresh memory for just a moment the universal consensus in the|united|state at that time late be that if could end own involvement and obtain the release of prisoner would provide adequate material support to south|vietnam the|north|vietnamese from the moment sign the paris accord systematically violate the cease fire and other provision of that agreement flagrantly disregard the ban on the infiltration of troop the north|vietnamese illegally introduce over|350,000 man into the south in direct violation of the agreement send in the most modern equipment in massive amount meanwhile continue to receive large quantity of supply and arm from friend in the face of this situation tear as be by the emotion of a decade of war be unable to respond deprive by law of the ability to enforce the agreement thus give north|vietnam assurance that could violate that agreement with impunity next reduce economic and arm aid to south|vietnam finally signal increase reluctance to give any support to that nation struggle for survival encourage by these development the north|vietnamese in recent|months begin send even reserve division into south|vietnam some|20 division virtually entire army be now in south|vietnam the government of south vietnam uncertain of further american assistance hastily order a strategic withdrawal to more defensible position this extremely difficult maneuver decide upon without consultation be poorly execute hamper by flood of refugee and thus lead to panic the result be painfully obvious and profoundly move in first public comment on this tragic development call for a new sense of national unity and purpose say would not engage in recrimination or attempt to assess the blame reiterate that tonight in the same spirit welcome the statement of the distinguished majority leader of the united states senate earlier|this|week and quote be time for the congress and the president to work together in the area of foreign as well as domestic policy so let start afresh be here to work with the congress in the conduct of foreign affair presidential initiative and ability to act swiftly in emergency be essential to national interest with respect to north|vietnam call upon hanoi and ask the congress to join with in this call to cease military operation immediately and to honor the term of the paris agreement the|united|state be urgently request the signatory of the paris conference to meet obligation to use influence to halt the fighting and to enforce the accord diplomatic note to this effect have be send to all member of the paris conference include the|soviet|union and the|people's|republic|of|china the situation in south|vietnam and cambodia have reach a critical phase require immediate and positive decision by this government the option before be few and the time be very short on the hand the|united|states could do nothing more let the government of south vietnam save and what be leave of territory if can let those south|vietnamese civilian who have work with for a|decade or more save life and family if can in short shut eye and wash hand of the whole affair if can or on the other hand could ask the congress for authority to enforce the paris accord with troop and tank and aircraft and artillery and carry the war to the enemy there be narrow option first stick with january request that congress appropriate for military assistance for south|vietnam and seek additional fund for economic and humanitarian purpose or increase request for both emergency military and humanitarian assistance to level which by good estimate may enable the south|vietnamese to stem the onrushe aggression to stabilize the military situation permit the chance of a negotiate political settlement between the north and south|vietnamese and if the very bad be to happen at least allow the orderly evacuation of americans and endanger south|vietnamese to place of safety let now state consideration and conclusion have receive a full report from general|weyand whom send to vietnam to assess the situation advise that the current military situation be very critical but that south|vietnam be continue to defend with the resource available however feel that if there be to be any chance of success for defense plan south|vietnam need urgently an|additional|$722|million in very specific military supply from the|united|state in judgment a stabilization of the military situation offer the good opportunity for a political solution must of course as think each of would consider the safety of nearly|6,000 americans who remain in south|vietnam and tens|of|thousand of south|vietnamese employee of the|united|states|government of news agency of contractor and business for many|year whose life with dependent be in very grave peril there be tens|of|thousand of other south|vietnamese intellectual professor teacher editor and opinion leader who have support the south|vietnamese cause and the alliance with the|united|state to whom have a profound moral obligation be also mindful of posture toward the rest of the world and particularly of future relation with the free nation of asia these nation must not think for a minute that the|united|states be pull out on or intend to abandon to aggression have therefore conclude that the national interest of the|united|state and the cause of world stability require that continue to give both military and humanitarian assistance to assistance to south vietnam at this stage must be swift and adequate drift and indecision invite far deep disaster the sum have request before the major north|vietnamese offensive and the sudden south|vietnamese retreat be obviously inadequate half hearted action would be bad than none must act together and act decisively be therefore ask the congress to appropriate without delay for emergency military assistance and an initial sum of for economic and humanitarian aid for south|vietnam the situation in south|vietnam be change very rapidly and the need for emergency food medicine and refugee relief be grow by the|hour will work with the congress in the|days|ahead to develop humanitarian assistance to meet these very pressing need fundamental decency require that do everything in power to ease the misery and the pain of the monumental human crisis which have befall the people of vietnam million have flee in the face of the communist onslaught and be now homeless and be now destitute hereby pledge in the name of the american people that the|united|state will make a maximum humanitarian effort to help care for and feed these hopeless victim and now ask the congress to clarify immediately restriction on the use of u.s. military force in southeast|asia for the limited purpose of protect american life by ensure evacuation if this should be necessary and also ask prompt revision of the law to cover those vietnamese to whom have a very special obligation and whose life may be endanger should the bad come to pass hope that this authority will never have to be use but if be need there will be no time for congressional debate because of the gravity of the situation ask the congress to complete action on all of these measure not in cambodia the situation be tragic the|united|state and the|cambodian|government have each make major effort over a long period and through many channel to end that conflict but because of military success steady external support and awareness of american legal restriction the communist side have show no interest in negotiation compromise or a political solution and yet for the|past|3|months the beleaguered people of phnom|penh have fight on hope against hope that the|united|states would not desert but instead provide the arm and ammunition so badly need have receive a moving letter from the new act president of cambodia saukham|khoy and let quote for dear mr. president write as the american congress reconvene to reconsider urgent request for supplemental assistance for the|khmer|republic appeal to to convey to the american legislator plea not to deny these vital resource to if a nonmilitary solution be to emerge from this tragic old conflict to find a peaceful end to the conflict need time do not know how much time but all fully realize that the agony of the khmer people can not and must not go on much long however for the immediate future need the rice to feed the hungry and the ammunition and the weapon to defend against those who want to impose will by force of arms]. a denial by the american people of the mean for to carry on will leave no alternative but inevitably abandon search for a solution which will give citizen some freedom of choice as to future for a|number|of|year now the cambodian people have place trust in america can not believe that this confidence be misplace and that suddenly america will deny the mean which may give a chance to find an acceptable solution to conflict this letter speak for in january request food and ammunition for the brave cambodians and regret to say that as of this|evening may be soon too late member of the congress fellow americans this moment of tragedy for indochina be a time of trial for be a time for national resolve have be say that the|united|states be over extended that have too many commitment too far from home that must reexamine what truly vital interest be and shape strategy to conform to find no fault with this as a theory but in the real world such a course must be pursue carefully and in close coordination with solid progress toward overall reduction in worldwide tension can not in the meantime abandon friend while adversary support and encourage can not dismantle defense diplomacy or intelligence capability while other increase and strengthen let put an end to self inflict wound let remember that national unity be a most priceless asset let deny adversary the satisfaction of use vietnam to pit americans against americans at this moment the|united|states must present to the world a united front above all let keep event in southeast|asia in proper perspective the security and the progress of hundreds|of|million of people everywhere depend importantly on let no potential adversary believe that difficulty or debate mean a slackening of national will will stand by friend will honor commitment and will uphold country 's principle the american people know that strength authority and leadership have help prevent a third world war for more than a generation will not shrink from this duty in let now review with the basic element of foreign policy speak candidly about strength and some of difficulty must first of all face the fact that what have happen in indochina have disquiet many of friend especially in asia must deal with this situation promptly and firmly to this end have already schedule meeting with the leader of australia new|zealand singapore and indonesia and expect to meet with the leader of other asian country as well a key country in this respect be japan the warm welcome receive in japan last|november vividly symbolize for both people the friendship and the solidarity of this extraordinary partnership look forward as be sure all of do with very special pleasure to welcome the emperor when visit later|this|year consider security treaty with japan the cornerstone of stability in the vast reach of asia and the pacific relation be crucial to mutual well being together be work energetically on the international multilateral agenda in trade energy and food will continue the process of strengthen friendship mutual security and prosperity also of course of fundamental importance be mutual security relationship with the|republic|of|korea which reaffirm on recent visit relation with europe have never be strong there be no people with whom america 's destiny have be more closely link there be no people whose friendship and cooperation be more need for the future for none of the member of the atlantic community can be secure none can prosper none can advance unless all do so together more than ever these time demand close collaboration in order to maintain the secure anchor of common security in this time of international riptide to work together on the promising negotiation with potential adversary to pool energy on the great new economic challenge that face in addition to this traditional agenda there be new problem involve energy raw material and the environment the atlantic nation face many and complex negotiation and decision be time to take stock to consult on future to affirm once again cohesion and common destiny therefore expect to join with the other leader of at a western summit in the very near future before this nato meeting earnestly ask the congress to weigh the broad consideration and consequence of past action on the complex greek turkish dispute over cyprus foreign policy can not be simply a collection of special economic or ethnic or ideological interest there must be a deep concern for the overall design of international action to achieve this design for peace and to assure that individual act have some coherence the executive must have some flexibility in the conduct of foreign policy united|stat military assistance to an old and faithful ally turkey have be cut off by action of the congress this have impose an embargo on military purchase by turkey extend even to item already pay for an unprecedented act against a friend these move know be sincerely intend to influence turkey in the cyprus negotiation deeply share the concern of many citizen for the immense human suffering on cyprus sympathize with the new democratic government in greece be continue earnest effort to find equitable solution to the problem which exist between greece and turkey but the result of the congressional action have be to block progress towards reconciliation thereby prolong the suffering on cyprus to complicate ability to promote successful negotiation to increase the danger of a broad conflict longstanding relationship with turkey be not simply a favor to turkey be a clear and essential mutual interest turkey lie on the rim of the|soviet|union and at the gate of the|middle|east be vital to the security of the eastern mediterranean the southern flank of western|europe and the collective security of the western alliance u.s. military basis in turkey be as critical to own security as be to the defense of nato therefore call upon the congress to lift the american arm embargo against turkish ally by pass the bipartisan mansfield scott bill now before the senate only this will enable to work with greece and turkey to resolve the difference between ally accept and indeed welcome the bill 's requirement for monthly report to the congress on progress toward a cyprus settlement but unless this be do with dispatch force may be set in motion within and between the nation which could not be reverse at the same time in order to strengthen the democratic government of greece and to reaffirm traditional tie with the people of greece be actively discuss a program of economic and military assistance with will shortly be submit specific request to the congress in this regard a vital element of foreign policy be relationship with the develop country in africa asia and these country must know that america be a true that america be a concerned friend reliable both in word and deed as evidence of this friendship urge the congress to reconsider provision of the trade act which have have an unfortunate and unintended impact on relation with latin|america where have such a long tie of friendship and cooperation under this legislation all member of opec be exclude from generalized system of trade preference this unfortunately punish friend ecuador and venezuela as well as other opec nation such as nigeria and indonesia none of which participate in last|year 's oil embargo this exclusion have seriously complicate new dialog with friend in this hemisphere therefore endorse the amendment which have be introduce in the congress to provide executive authority to waive those restriction on the trade act that be incompatible with national interest the interest of america as well as ally be vitally affect by what happen in the|middle|east so long as the state of tension continue threaten military crisis the weakening of alliance the stability of the world economy and confrontation with the nuclear super power these be intolerable risk because be in the unique position of be able to deal with all the party have at request be engage for the|past|year|and|a|half in the peacemaking effort unparallele in the history of the region policy have bring remarkable success on the road to peace last|year major disengagement agreement be negotiate and implement with help for the first time in a process of negotiation on the basic political issue be begin and be continue unfortunately the late effort to reach a further interim agreement between israel and egypt have be suspend the issue divide the party be vital to and not amenable to easy and to quick solution however the|united|states will not be discourage the momentum toward peace that have be achieve over the|last|18|months must and will be maintain the active role of the|united|state must and will be continue the drift toward war must and will be prevent pledge the|united|state to a major effort for peace in the|middle|east an effort which know have the solid support of the american people and congress be now examine how best to proceed have agree in principle to reconvene the|geneva|conference be prepare as well to explore other forum the|united|state will move ahead on whatever course look most promising either towards an overall settlement or interim agreement should the party desire will not accept stagnation or stalemate with all attendant risk to peace and prosperity and to relation in and outside of the region the national interest and national security require as well that reduce the danger of war shall strive to do so by continue to improve relation with potential adversary the|united|state and the|soviet|union share an interest in lessen tension and build a more stable relationship during this process have never have any illusion know that be deal with a nation that reflect different principle and be competitor in many part of the globe through a combination of firmness and flexibility the|united|state in recent|years lay the basis of a more reliable relationship found on mutual interest and mutual restraint but can not expect the|soviet|union to show restraint in the face of the|united|state ' weakness or irresolution as long as be president america will maintain strength alliance and principle as a prerequisite to a more peaceful planet as long as be president will not permit detente to become a license to fish in troubled water detente must be and trust will be a way relationship central to u.s.-soviet relation today be the critical negotiation to control strategic nuclear weapon hope to turn the vladivostok agreement into a final agreement this|year at the time of general secretary brezhnev 's visit to the|united|state such an agreement would for the first time put a ceiling on the strategic arm race would mark a turning point in postwar history and would be a crucial step in lift from mankind the threat of nuclear war use of trade and economic sanction as weapon to alter the internal conduct of other nation must also be seriously reexamine however well intentione the goal the fact be that some of recent action in the economic field have be self defeat be not achieve the objective intend by the congress and have damage foreign policy the|trade|act of prohibit most favor nation treatment credit and investment guarantee and commercial agreement with the|soviet|union so long as emigration policy fail to meet criterion the|soviet|union have therefore refuse to put into effect the important trade agreement between country as a result western|europe and japan have step into the breach those country have extend credit to the|soviet|union exceed in the|last|6|months these be economic opportunity job and business which could have go to americans there should be no illusion about the nature of the soviet system but there should be no illusion about how to deal with belief in the right of people of the world freely to emigrate have be well demonstrate this legislation however not only harm relation with the|soviet|union but seriously complicate the prospect of those seek to emigrate the favorable trend aid by quiet diplomacy by which emigration increase from in to over in have be seriously set back remedial legislation be urgently need in national interest with the|people's|republic|of|china be firmly fix on the course set forth in the shanghai communique stability in asia and the world require constructive relation with fourth of the human race after two|decade of mutual isolation and hostility have in recent|years build a promising foundation deep difference in philosophy and social system will endure but so should mutual long term interest and the goal to which country have jointly subscribe in shanghai will visit china later|this|year to reaffirm these interest and to accelerate the improvement in relation and be glad to welcome the distinguished speaker and the distinguished minority leader of the house back today from constructive visit to the|people's|republic|of|china let talk about new challenge the issue have discuss be the most pressing of the traditional agenda on foreign policy but ahead of also be a vast new agenda of issue in an interdependent world the|united|state with economic power technology z for new horizon be the acknowledge world leader in deal with many of these challenge if this be a moment of uncertainty in the world be even more a moment of rare opportunity be summon to meet of man 's most basic challenge hunger at the|world|food|conference last|november in rome the|united|states outline a comprehensive program to close the ominous gap between population growth and food production over the long term technological skill and enormous productive capacity be crucial to accomplish this task the old order in trade finance and raw material be change and american leadership be need in the creation of new institution and practice for worldwide prosperity and progress the world 's ocean with immense resource and strategic importance must become area of cooperation rather than conflict american policy be direct to that end technology must be harness to the service of mankind while protect the environment this too be an arena for american leadership the interest and the aspiration of the developed and develop nation must be reconcile in a manner that be both realistic and humane this be goal in this new era of the fine success story in foreign policy be cooperative effort with other major energy consume nation in little|more|than|a|year together with partner have create the|international|energy|agency have negotiate an emergency sharing arrangement which help to reduce the danger of an embargo have launch major international conservation effort have develop a massive program for the development of alternative source of energy but the fate of all of these program depend crucially on what do at home that pass bring closer to the|day when will be dependent on import energy for of requirement a new embargo under these condition could have a devastating impact on job industrial expansion and inflation at home economy can not be leave to the mercy of decision over which have no control and call upon the congress to act affirmatively in a world where information be power a vital element of national security lie in intelligence service be essential to nation 's security in peace as in war americans can be grateful for the important but largely unsung contribution and achievement of the intelligence service of this nation be entirely proper that this system be subject to congressional review but a sensationalize public debate over legitimate intelligence activity be a disservice to this nation and a threat to intelligence system tie hand while potential enemy operate with secrecy with skill and with vast resource any investigation must be conduct with maximum discretion and dispatch to avoid cripple a vital national institution let speak quite frankly to some in this chamber and perhaps to some not in this chamber the|central|intelligence|agency have be of maximum importance to president before the|central|intelligence|agency have be of maximum importance to the|central|intelligence|agency and associated intelligence organization could be of maximum importance to some of in this audience who may be president at some later date think would be catastrophic for the congress or anyone else to destroy the usefulness by dismantle in effect intelligence system upon which rest so heavily now as congress oversee intelligence activity must of course organize to do so in a responsible way have be traditional for the executive to consult with the congress through specially protect procedure that safeguard essential secret but recently some of those procedure have alter in a way that make the protection of vital information very very difficult will say to the leader of the congress the house and the senate that will work with to devise procedure which will meet the need of the congress for review of intelligence agency activity and the need of the nation for an effective intelligence service underlie any successful foreign policy be the strength and the credibility of defense posture be strong and be ready and intend to remain so improvement of relation with adversary do not mean any relaxation of national vigilance on the contrary be the firm maintenance of both strength and vigilance that make possible steady progress toward a safe and a more peaceful world the national security budget that have submit be the minimum the|united|state need in this|critical|hour the congress should review carefully and know will but be considered judgment that any significant reduction revision would endanger national security and thus jeopardize the peace let no ally doubt determination to maintain a defense second to none and let no adversary be tempt to test readiness or resolve history be test today can not afford indecision disunity or disarray in the conduct of foreign affair and can resolve here and now that this nation shall move ahead with wisdom with assurance and with national unity the world look to for the vigor and for the vision that have demonstrate so often in the past in great moment of national history and as look down the road see a confident america secure in strength secure in value and determine to maintain both see a conciliatory america extend hand to ally and adversary alike form bond of cooperation to deal with the vast problem face all see a compassionate america heart reach out to orphan to refugee and to fellow human being afflict by war by tyranny and by hunger as president entrust by the constitution with primary responsibility for the conduct of foreign affair renew the pledge make last|august to work cooperatively with the congress ask that the congress help to keep america 's word good throughout the world be nation government and must have foreign policy in an hour far dark than this abraham|lincoln tell fellow citizen and quote can not escape history of this congress and this administration will be remember in spite of no personal significance or insignificance can spare or another of who be entrust by the people with the great decision that fashion future can escape neither responsibility nor conscience by what do now the world will know courage constancy and compassion the spirit of america be good and the heart of america be strong let be proud of what have do and confident of what can do and may god ever guide to do what be right thank view transcript transcript mr. speaker mr. vice president member of the|94th|congress and distinguished guest year ago a freshman congressman a young fellow with lot of idealism who be out to change the world stand before sam|rayburn in the well of the house and solemnly swear to the same oath that all of take yesterday an unforgettable experience and congratulate all two|days|later that same freshman stand at the back of this great chamber over there someplace â€” as president truman all charge up by single handed election victory report as the constitution require on the state of the union when the bipartisan applause stop president truman say be happy to report to this 81st congress that the state of the union be good nation be better able than ever before to meet the need of the american people and to give fair chance in the pursuit of happiness be foremost among the nation of the world in the search for peace today that freshman member from michigan stand where mr. truman stand and must say to that the state of the union be not good million of americans be out of work recession and inflation be erode the money of million more price be too high and sale be too slow this year 's federal deficit will be about|$30|billion next|year 's probably the national debt will rise to over plant capacity and productivity be not increase fast enough depend on other for essential energy some people question government 's ability to make hard decision and stick with expect washington politic as usual yet what president truman say on january|5,|1949 be even more true in be better able to meet people 's need all americans do have a fair chance to pursue happiness not only be still the foremost nation in the pursuit of peace but today 's prospect of attain be infinitely bright there be americans employ at the|start|of|1949 now there be more|than|85|million americans who have job in comparable dollar the average income of the american family have double during the|past|26|year now want to speak very bluntly have get bad news and do not expect much if any applause the american people want action and will take both the congress and the president to give what want progress and solution can be achieve and will be achieve message today be not intend to address all of the complex need of america will send separate message make specific recommendation for domestic legislation such as the extension of general revenue sharing and the|voting|rights|act the moment have come to move in a new direction can do this by fashion a new partnership between the congress on the hand the|white|house on the other and the people both represent let mobilize the most powerful and most creative industrial nation that ever exist on this earth to put all people to work the emphasis on economic effort must now shift from inflation to job to bolster business and industry and to create new job propose a year tax reduction of quarter would go to individual and quarter to promote business investment this cash rebate to individual amount to of tax payment a total cut of with a maximum of per return call on the congress to act by april|1 if do â€” and hope will â€” the treasury can send the first check for half of the rebate in may and the second by september the other fourth of the cut about|$4|billion will go to business include farm to promote expansion and to create more job the year reduction for business would be in the form of a liberalized investment tax credit increase the rate to for all business this tax cut do not include the more fundamental reform need in tax system but point in the right direction allow taxpayer rather than the government to spend pay cut taxis now be essential if be to turn the economy around a tax cut offer the good hope of create more job unfortunately will increase the size of the budget deficit therefore be more important than ever that take step to control the growth of federal expenditure part of trouble be that have be self indulgent for decade have be vote ever increase level of government benefit and now the bill have come due have be add so many new program that the size and the growth of the federal budget have take on a life of own characteristic of these program be that cost increase automatically every year because the number of people eligible for most of the benefit increase every|year when these program be enact there be no dollar amount set no one know what will cost all know be that whatever cost last|year will cost more next|year be a question of simple arithmetic unless check the excessive growth of federal expenditure or impose on match increase in taxis will continue to run huge inflationary deficit in the federal budget if project the current build in momentum of federal spending through the|next|15|year state federal and local government expenditure could easily comprise half of gross national product this compare with less|than|a|third in have just conclude the process of prepare the budget submission for fiscal|year|1976 in that budget will propose legislation to restrain the growth of a number of exist program have also conclude that no new spending program can be initiate this|year except for energy further will not hesitate to veto any new spending program adopt by the congress as an additional step toward put the federal government 's house in order recommend a limit on federal pay increase in in all government program tie to the consumer price index include social security civil service and military retirement pay and food stamp also propose a year maximum increase of none of these recommend ceiling limitation over which congress have final authority be easy to propose because in most case involve anticipate payment to many many deserve people nonetheless must be do must emphasize that be not ask to eliminate to reduce to freeze these payment be merely recommend that slow down the rate at which these payment increase and these program grow only a reduction in the growth of spending can keep federal borrowing down and reduce the damage to the private sector from high interest rate only a reduction in spending can make possible for the|federal|reserve|system to avoid an inflationary growth in the money supply and thus restore balance to economy a major reduction in the growth of federal spending can help dispel the uncertainty that so many feel about economy and put on the way to cure economic ill if do not act to slow down the rate of increase in federal spending the|united|states|treasury will be legally obligate to spend more|than|$360|billion in fiscal|year|1976 even if no new program be enact these be not matter of conjecture or prediction but again a matter of simple arithmetic the size of these number and implication for everyday life and the health of economic system be shocking submit to the last congress a list of budget deferral and rescission there will be more cut recommend in the budget that will submit even so the level of outlay for fiscal|year|1976 be still much much too high not only be too high for this|year but the decision make now will inevitably have a major and grow impact on expenditure level in future|year think this be a very fundamental issue that the congress and must jointly solve economic disruption and other be experience stem in part from the fact that the world price of petroleum have quadruple in the|last|year but in all honesty can not put all of the blame on the oil export nation the|united|state be not blameless grow dependence upon foreign source have be add to vulnerability for year and year and do nothing to prepare for such an event as the embargo of during the|1960s this country have a surplus capacity of crude oil which be able to make available to trading partner whenever there be a disruption of supply this surplus capacity enable to influence both supply and price of crude oil throughout the world excess capacity neutralize any effort at establish an effective cartel and thus the rest of the world be assure of adequate supply of oil at reasonable price by surplus capacity have vanish and as a consequence the latent power of the oil cartel could emerge in full force europe and japan both heavily dependent on import oil now struggle to keep economy in balance even the|united|state country which be far more self sufficient than most other industrial country have be under serious pressure be propose a program which will begin to restore country 's surplus capacity in total energy in this way will be able to assure reliable and adequate energy and help foster a new world energy stability for other major consuming nation but this nation and in fact the world must face the prospect of energy difficulty between|now|and|1985 this program will impose burden on all of with the aim of reduce consumption of energy and increase production great attention have be pay to the consideration of fairness and can assure that the burden will not fall more harshly on those less able to bear be recommend a plan to make invulnerable to cutoff of foreign oil will require sacrifice but and this be most important will work have set the follow national energy goal to assure that future be as secure and as productive as past first must reduce oil import by one|million|barrels per day by and by two|million|barrels per day by the|end|of|1977 must end vulnerability to economic disruption by foreign supplier by third must develop energy technology and resource so that the|united|states have the ability to supply a significant share of the energy need of the free world by to attain these objective need immediate action to cut import unfortunately in the short term there be only a limited number of action which can increase domestic supply will press for all of urge quick action on the necessary legislation to allow commercial production at the elk|hills california naval|petroleum|reserve in order that make great use of domestic coal resource be submit amendment to the|energy|supply|and|environmental|coordination|act which will greatly increase the number of powerplant that can be promptly convert to coal obviously voluntary conservation continue to be essential but tough program be need and need now therefore be use presidential power to raise the fee on all import crude oil and petroleum product the crude oil fee level will be increase per barrel on february|1 by per barrel on march|1 and by per barrel on april|1 will take action to reduce undue hardship on any geographical region the foregoing be interim administrative action will be rescind when the broad but necessary legislation be enact to that end be request the congress to act within on a more comprehensive energy tax program include excise taxis and import fee total per barrel on product import and on all crude oil deregulation of new natural gas and enactment of a natural gas excise tax plan to take presidential initiative to decontrol the price of domestic crude oil on april|1 urge the congress to enact a windfall profit tax by that date to ensure that oil producer do not profit unduly the soon congress act the more effective the oil conservation program will be and the quick the federal revenue can be return to people be prepared to use presidential authority to limit import as necessary to guarantee success want to know that before decide on energy conservation program consider ration and high gasoline taxis as alternative in judgment neither would achieve the desire result and both would produce unacceptable inequity a massive program must be initiate to increase energy supply to cut demand and provide new standby emergency program to achieve the independence want by the large part of increase oil production must come from new frontier area on the|outer|continental|shelf and from in alaska be the intent of this administration to move ahead with exploration leasing and production on those frontier area of the outer continental shelf where the environmental risk be acceptable use of most abundant domestic resource â€” coal be severely limited must strike a reasonable compromise on environmental concern with coal be submit clean|air act amendment which will allow great coal use without sacrifice clean air goal veto the strip mining legislation pass by the last congress with appropriate change will sign a revise version when come to the|white|house be propose a number of action to energize nuclear power program will submit legislation to expedite nuclear leasing licensing and the rapid selection of site in recent|month utility have cancel or postpone over of plan nuclear expansion and of plan addition to non - nuclear capacity financing problem for that industry be worsen be therefore recommend that the year investment tax credit of be extend to specifically speed the construction of powerplant that do not use natural gas or oil be also submit proposal for selective reform of state utility commission regulation to provide the critical stability for domestic energy production in the face of world price uncertainty will request legislation to authorize and require tariff import quota or price floor to protect energy price at level which will achieve energy independence increase energy supply be not enough must take additional step to cut long term consumption therefore propose to the congress legislation to make thermal efficiency standard mandatory for all new building in the|united|state a new tax credit of up|to|$150 for those homeowner who install insulation equipment the establishment of an energy conservation program to help low income family purchase insulation supply legislation to modify and defer automotive pollution standard for five|year which will enable to improve automobile gas mileage by by these proposal and action cumulatively can reduce dependence on foreign energy supply from three|to|five|million|barrel per day by to make the|united|state invulnerable to foreign disruption propose standby emergency legislation and a strategic storage program of one|billion|barrels of oil for domestic need and for national defense purpose will ask for the fund need for energy research and development activity have establish a goal of of synthetic fuel and shale oil production per day by together with an incentive program to achieve have a very deep belief in america 's capability within the|next|10|year program envision major nuclear powerplant major new coal mine major coal fire powerplant major new oil refinery major new synthetic fuel plant the drilling of new oil well the insulation of home and the manufacturing and the sale of million of new automobile truck and bus that use much less fuel happen to believe that can do in another crisis the in president franklin|d.|roosevelt say this country would build military aircraft by production in that program have reach aircraft annually do then can do now if the congress and the american people will work with to attain these target will be achieve and will be surpass from adversity let seize opportunity revenue of some|$30|billion from high energy taxis design to encourage conservation must be refund to the american people in a manner which correct distortion in tax system work by inflation people have be push into high tax bracket by inflation with consequent reduction in actual spending power business taxis be similarly distort because inflation exaggerate report profit result in excessive taxis accordingly propose that future individual income taxis be reduce by this will be do by raise the low income allowance and reduce tax rate this continue tax cut will primarily benefit lower- and middle income taxpayer for example a typical family of with a gross income of now pay in federal income taxis under this tax cut plan would pay nothing a family of with a gross income of now pay in federal taxis proposal reduce that total by family gross would receive a reduction of those with the very low income who can least afford high cost must also be compensate propose a payment of to every person 18|years|of|age and old in that very limited category state and local government will receive in additional revenue sharing to offset increase energy cost to offset inflationary distortion and to generate more economic activity the corporate tax rate will be reduce from to now let turn if may to the international dimension of the present crisis at no time in peacetime history have the state of the nation depend more heavily on the state of the world and seldom if ever have the state of the world depend more heavily on the state of nation the economic distress be global will not solve at home unless help to remedy the profound economic dislocation abroad world trade and monetary structure provide market energy food and vital raw material for all nation this international system be now in jeopardy this nation can be proud of significant achievement in recent|years in solve problem and crisis the berlin agreement the salt agreement new relationship with china the unprecedented effort in the|middle|east be immensely encouraging but the world be not free from crisis in a world of nation where nuclear technology be proliferate and regional conflict continue international security can not be take for grant so let there be no mistake about international cooperation be a vital factor of life today this be not a moment for the american people to turn inward more than ever before own well being depend on america 's determination and america 's leadership in the whole wide world be a great nation spiritually politically militarily diplomatically and economically america 's commitment to international security have sustain the safety of ally and friend in many area in the|middle|east in europe and in asia turn away would unleash new instability new danger around the globe which in turn would threaten own security at the end of world|war|ii turn a similar challenge into an historic opportunity and may add an historic achievement an old order be in disarray political and economic institution be shatter in that period this nation and partner build new institution new mechanism of mutual support and cooperation today as then face an historic opportunity if act imaginatively and boldly as act then this period will in retrospect be see as of the great creative moment of nation 's history the whole world be watch to see how respond a resurgent american economy would do more to restore the confidence of the world in own future than anything else can do the program that this congress pass can demonstrate to the world that have start to put own house in order if can show that this nation be able and willing to help other nation meet the common challenge can demonstrate that the|united|state will fulfill responsibility as a leader among nation quite frankly at stake be the future of industrialize democracy which have perceive destiny in common and sustain in common for the develop nation be also at a turning point the poor nation see hope of feed hungry and develop society shatter by the economic crisis the long term economic future for the producer of raw material also depend on cooperative solution relation with the communist country be a basic factor of the world environment must seek to build a long term basis for coexistence will stand by principle will stand by interest will act firmly when challenge the kind of a world want depend on a broad policy of create mutual incentive for restraint and for cooperation as move forward to meet global challenge and opportunity must have the tool to do the job military force be strong and ready this military strength deter aggression against ally stabilize relation with former adversary and protect homeland fully adequate conventional and strategic force cost many many billion but these dollar be sound insurance for safety and for a more peaceful world military strength alone be not sufficient effective diplomacy be also essential in prevent conflict in build world understanding the vladivostok negotiation with the|soviet|union represent a major step in moderate strategic arm competition recent discussion with the leader of the atlantic community japan and south|korea have contribute to meet the common challenge but have serious problem before that require cooperation between the president and the congress by the constitution and tradition the execution of foreign policy be the responsibility of the president in recent|years under the stress of the|vietnam|war legislative restriction on the president 's ability to execute foreign policy and military decision have proliferate as a member of the congress oppose some and approve other as president welcome the advice and cooperation of the house and the senate but if foreign policy be to be successful can not rigidly restrict in legislation the ability of the president to act the conduct of negotiation be ill suited to such limitation legislative restriction intend for the good motif and purpose can have the opposite result as have see most recently in trade relation with the|soviet|union for part pledge this administration will act in the close consultation with the congress as face delicate situation and troubled time throughout the globe when become president only|five|months|ago promise the last congress a policy of communication conciliation compromise and cooperation renew that pledge to the new member of this congress let sum up america need a new

in fact reemphasize that this be not a compulsory wage and price control agency now know many americans see federal control as the answer but believe from past experience control show that never really stop inflation â€” not the last time not even during and immediately after world|war|ii when as recall price rise despite severe and enforceable wartime rationing now peacetime control actually know from recent experience create shortage hamper production stifle growth and limit job do not ask for such power however politically tempting as such a program could cause the fixer and the black marketeer to flourish while decent citizen face empty shelf and stand in long waiting line number need more capital can not eat up seed corn free enterprise system depend on orderly capital market through which the saving of people become productively use today capital market be in total disarray must restore vitality prudent monetary restraint be essential and the american people should know

especially helpful to capital intensive industry such as primary metal public utility where capacity shortage have develop be ask congress to enact tax legislation to provide that all dividend on

provide a sounder capital structure capital gain tax legislation must be liberalize as propose by the tax reform bill currently before the|committee|on|ways|and|mean endorse this approach and hope that will pass promptly number help the casualty and this be a very important part of the overall speech the conference on inflation make everybody even more aware of who be suffer most from inflation foremost be those who be jobless through no fault of own three|weeks|ago release fund which with early action provide public service employment for some|170,000 who need work now propose to the congress a step program to augment this action first of special unemployment insurance benefit would be provide to those who have exhaust regular and extended unemployment insurance benefit and of special unemployment insurance benefit to those who qualify but be not now cover by regular unemployment insurance program funding in this case would come from the general treasury not from taxis on employer as be the case with the establish unemployment program second ask the congress to create a brand new community|improvement|corp to provide work for the unemployed through short term useful work project to improve beautify and enhance the environment of city town and countryside this standby program would come alive whenever unemployment exceed nationally would be stop when unemployment drop below|6|percent local labor market would each qualify for grant whenever unemployment rate exceed state and local government contractor would supervise these project and could hire only those who have exhaust unemployment insurance benefit the goal of this new program be to provide more constructive work for all americans young or old who can not find a job the purpose really follow this formula short term problem require short term remedy therefore request that these program be for a period now know that low- and middle income americans have be hardest hit by inflation budget be most vulnerable because a large part of income go for the highly inflated cost of food fuel and medical care the tax reform bill now in the|house|committee|on|ways|and|means which favor already provide approximately|$1.6|billion of tax relief to these group compensate new revenue be provide in this prospective legislation by a windfall tax profit tax on oil producer and by close other loophole if enact this will be a major contribution by the congress in common effort to make tax system fair to all number stimulate housing without question credit be the lifeblood of housing the|united|state unfortunately be suffer the long and the most severe housing recession since the end of world|war|ii unemployment in the construction trade be twice the national average of first act as president be to sign the|housing|and|community|development|act of have since conclude that still more help be need help that can be deliver very quickly and with minimum inflationary impact urge the congress to enact before recess additional legislation to make most home mortgage eligible for purchase by an agency of the|federal|government as the law stand now only fha or va home mortgage fifth of the total be cover be very glad that the senate thank to the leadership of senator brooke and senator cranston have already make substantial progress on this legislation as soon as come to will make at|least|$3|billion immediately available for mortgage purchase enough to finance about|100,000 more american home number thrift institution saving and loan and similar institution be hard hit by inflation and high interest rate no longer attract unfortunately adequate deposit the executive branch in judgment must join with the congress in give critically need attention to the structure and the operation of thrift institution which now find for the third time in in another period of serious mortgage credit scarcity passage of the pende financial institution bill will help but no single measure have yet appear as see to solve feast or famine in mortgage credit however promise to work with individually and collectively to develop additional specific program in this area in the future number international interdependency the|united|state have a responsibility not only to maintain a healthy economy at home but also to seek policy which complement rather than disrupt the constructive effort of other essential to u.s. initiative be the early passage of an acceptable trade reform bill special representative for trade negotiations depart earlier|this|afternoon to canada europe japan to brief foreign friend on proposal live in an interdependent world and therefore must work together to resolve common economic problem number federal taxis and spending to support program to increase production and share inflation produce hardship need additional tax revenue be aware that any proposal for new taxis just|four|weeks before a national election be to put mildly consider politically unwise and be frank to say that have be earnestly advise to wait and talk about taxis anytime after november|5 but do say in sincerity that will not play politic with america 's future present inflation to a considerable degree come from many|year of enact expensive program without raise enough revenue to pay for the truth be that out of the|25|year have the honor and the privilege to serve in this chamber the|federal|government end up with federal deficit that be not a very good batting average by now almost everybody â€” almost everybody else should say â€” have state position on federal gasoline taxis this time will do be not emphasize not ask for any increase in gas taxis be â€” be ask to approve a l year temporary tax surcharge of on corporate and upper level individual income this would generally exclude from the surcharge those family with gross income below a year the|estimated|$5|billion in extra revenue to be raise by this inflation fight tax should pay for the new program have recommend in this message think and suspect each of know this be the acid test of joint determination to whip inflation in america would not ask this if major loophole be not now be close by the|committee|on|ways|and|mean ' tax reform bill urge to join before recess in addition to what have say before to join by vote to set a target spending limit let emphasize a target spending limit of for the federal fiscal budget of when congress agree to this spending target will submit a package of budget deferral and rescission to meet this goal will do the tough job of designate for congressional action on return those area which believe can and must be reduce these will be hard choice and every of in this chamber know as well as i. will be hard choice but no federal agency include the|defense|department will be untouchable be judgment that fiscal discipline be a necessary weapon in any fight against inflation while this spending target be a small step be a step in the right direction and need to get on that course without any further delay do not think that any of in this chamber today can ask the american people to tighten belt if uncle|sam be unwilling to tighten belt first and now if may would like to say a few word directly to constituent and incidentally fellow americans ask to get thing start by make a list of way to fight inflation and save energy to exchange list with neighbor and to send a copy have personally read score of the thousand of letter receive at the|white|house and incidentally have make economic expert read some of too all benefit at least do and thank each and every of for this cooperation some of the good idea from home to have be crank into the recommendation have just make to the congress and the step be take as president to whip inflation right now there be also firm warning on what government must not do and appreciate those too good suggestion for voluntary restraint and self discipline show that a great degree of patriotic determination and unanimity already exist in this great land have ask congress for urgent specific action alone can take advise congress of the initial step that be take as president here be what only can do unless every able american pitch in congress and can not do the job win fight against inflation and waste involve total mobilization of america 's great resource the brain the skill and the willpower of the american people here be what must do what each and every of can do to help increase food and low price grow more and waste less to help save scarce fuel in the energy crisis drive less heat less every housewife know almost exactly how much spend for food last|week if can not spare a penny from food budget and know there be many â€” surely can cut the food that waste by every american motorist know exactly how many mile or drive to work or to school every day and about how much mileage or run up each|year if all drive few mile can save almost unbelievably of foreign oil per day by the|end|of|1975 most of can do better|than|5|percent by carpoole take the bus rid bike or just plain walk can save enough gas by self discipline to meet our|1|million|barrel per day goal think there be final thing that all americans can do rich or poor and that be share with other can share burden as can share blessing sharing be not easy not easy to measure like mileage and family budget but be sure that more be not nearly enough to ask so ask to share everything can and a little bit more and will strengthen spirit as well as economy today will not take more of the time of this busy congress for vividly remember the rush before every recess and the clock be already run on specific and urgent request for legislative action also remember how much congress can get do when put shoulder to the wheel one|week|from|tonight have a long stand invitation in kansas|city to address the|future|farmers|of|america a fine organization of wonderful young people whose help with million of other be vital in this battle will elaborate then how volunteer inflation fighter and energy saver can further mobilize total effort since ask miss sylvia|porter the well know financial writer to help organize an all out nationwide volunteer mobilization have name a white|house coordinator and have enlist the enthusiastic support and service of other distinguish americans to help

latin|america to meet new challenge in a rapidly change world the maintenance of such relationship underpin rather than undercut the search for peace will seek out will expand relation with old

in cyprus the|middle|east and in indochina peace can not be impose from without but will do whatever be within capacity to help achieve rededicate to the search for justice equality and freedom recent development in africa signal the welcome end of colonialism behavior appropriate to an era of dependence must give way to the new responsibility of an era of interdependence no single nation no single group of nation no single organization can meet all of the challenge before the community of nation must act in concert progress toward a well world must come through cooperative effort across the whole range of bilateral and multilateral relation america 's revolutionary birth and century of experience in adjust democratic government to change condition have make americans practical as well as idealistic as idealist be proud of role in the founding of the|united|nation and in support many accomplishment as practical people be sometimes impatient at what see as shortcoming in year as a member of learn basic practical lesson first man of differ political persuasion can find common ground for cooperation need not agree on all issue in order to agree on most difference of principle of purpose of perspective will not disappear but neither will mutual problem disappear unless be determined to find mutually helpful solution second a majority must take into account the proper interest of a minority if the decision of the majority be to be accept who believe in and live by majority rule must always be alert to the danger of the tyranny of the majority majority rule thrive on the habit of accommodation moderation and consideration of the interest of other a very stark reality have temper america 's action for decade and must now temper the action of all nation prevention of full scale warfare in the nuclear age have become everybody 's responsibility today 's regional conflict must not become tomorrow 's world disaster must assure by every mean at disposal that local crisis be quickly contain and resolve the challenge before nation be very clear this organization can place the weight of the world community on the side of world peace and this organization can provide impartial force to maintain the peace and at this point wish to pay tribute on behalf of the american people to the member of the united|nation peacekeeping force who have give life in the|middle|east and in cyprus in the|past|10|months and convey deep sympathy to love one let the quality of response measure up to the magnitude of the challenge that face pledge to that america will continue to be constructive innovative and responsive to the work of this great body the nation in this hall be unite by a deep concern for peace be united as well by desire to ensure a well life for all people today the economy of the world be under unprecedented stress need new approach to international cooperation to respond effectively to the problem that face develop and develop country market and nonmarket country be all a part of interdependent economic system the food and oil crisis demonstrate the extent of interdependence many develop nation need the food surplus of a few developed nation and many industrialized nation need the oil production of a few develop nation energy be require to produce food and food to produce energy and both to provide a decent life for everyone the problem of food and energy can be resolve on the basis of cooperation or can should say be make unmanageable on the basis of confrontation runaway inflation propel by food and oil price increase be an early warning signal to all of let not delude failure to cooperate on oil and food and inflation could spell disaster for every nation represent in this room the|united|nation must not and need not allow this to occur a global strategy for food and energy be urgently require the|united|states believe principle should guide a global approach first all nation must substantially increase production just to maintain the present standard of live the world must almost double output of food and energy to match the expect increase in the world 's population by to meet aspiration for a well life production will have to expand at a significantly fast rate than population growth all nation must seek to achieve a level of price which not only provide an incentive to producer but which consumer can afford should now be clear that the develop nation be not the only country which demand and receive an adequate return for good but should also be clear that by confront consumer with production restriction artificial pricing and the prospect of ultimate bankruptcy producer will eventually become the victim of own action third all nation must avoid the abuse of man 's fundamental need for the sake of narrow national or bloc advantage the attempt by any nation to use commodity for political purpose will inevitably tempt other country to use commodity for own purpose fourth the nation of the world must assure that the poor among be not overwhelm by rise price of the import necessary for survival the traditional aid donor and the increasingly wealthy oil producer must join in this effort the|united|state recognize the special responsibility bear as the world 's large producer of food that be why secretary of state kissinger propose from this very podium last|year a world food conference to define a global food policy and that be reason why have remove domestic restriction on food production in the|united|state have not be policy to use food as a political weapon despite the oil embargo and recent oil price and production decision would be tempt for the|united|state beset by inflation and soar energy price to turn a deaf ear to external appeal for food assistance or to respond with internal appeal for export control but however difficult own economic situation recognize that the plight of other be bad americans have always respond to human emergency in the past and respond again here today in response to secretary general waldheim 's appeal and to help meet the long term challenge in food reiterate to help develop nation realize aspiration to grow more of own food the|united|state will substantially increase assistance to agricultural production program in other country next to ensure that the survival of million of fellow man do not depend upon the vagary of weather the|united|state be prepared to join in a worldwide effort to negotiate establish and maintain an international system of food reserve this system will work best if each nation be make responsible for manage the reserve that will have available finally to make certain that the more immediate need for food be meet this|year the|united|states will not only maintain the amount spend for food shipment to nation in need but will increase this amount this|year thus the|united|state be strive to help define and help contribute to a cooperative global policy to meet man 's immediate and long term need for food will set forth comprehensive proposal at the|world|food|conference in november now be the time for oil producer to define conception of a global policy on energy to meet the grow need and to do this without impose unacceptable burden on the international monetary and trade system a world of economic confrontation can not be a world of political cooperation if fail to satisfy man 's fundamental need for energy and food face a threat not just to aspiration for a well life for all people but to hope for a more stable and a more peaceful world by work together to overcome common problem mankind can turn from fear towards hope from the time of the founding of the|united|nation america volunteer to help nation in need frequently as the main benefactor be able to do be glad to do but as new economic force alter and reshape today 's complex world no nation can be expect to feed all the world 's hungry people fortunately however many nation be increasingly able to help and call on to join with as truly united nation in the struggle to produce to provide more food at low price for the hungry and in general a well life for the needy of this world america will continue to do more than share but there be realistic limit to capacity there be no limit however to determination to act in concert with other nation to fulfill the vision of the|united|nations|charter to save succeed generation from the scourge of war and to promote social progress and well standard well standard of life in a large freedom thank very very much view transcript transcript good morning in my|first|week as president ask the attorney general and the secretary of defense to report to after consultation with other governmental official and private citizen concern on the status of those young americans who have be convict charge investigate or be still be seek as draft evader or military deserter on august|19 at the national convention of veterans|of|foreign|war in the city of chicago announce intention to give these young people a chance to earn return to the mainstream of american society so that can if choose contribute even though belatedly to the building and the betterment of country and the world do this for the simple reason that for american fighting man the long and divisive war in vietnam have be over for more|than|a|year and be determine then as now to do everything in power to bind up the nation 's wound promise to throw the weight of presidency into the scale of justice on the side of leniency and mercy but promise also to work within the exist system of military and civilian law and the precedent set by predecessor who face similar postwar situation among president and harry|s.|truman objective of make future penalty fit the seriousness of each individual 's offense and of mitigate punishment already mete out in a spirit of equity have prove an immensely hard and very complicated matter even more difficult than know would be but the agency of government concerned and own staff have work with literally night and day in order to develop fair and orderly procedure and complete work for final approval over this|last|weekend do not want to delay another|day in resolve the dilemma of the past so that may all get go on the press problem of the present therefore be today sign the necessary presidential proclamation and executive order that will put this plan into effect the program provide for administrative disposition of case involve draft evader and military deserter not yet convict or punish in such case of alternate service will be require which may be reduce for mitigate circumstance the program also deal with case of those already convict by a civilian or military court for the latter purpose be establish a clemency review board of distinguished americans whose duty will be to assist in assure that the government 's forgiveness be extend to applicable case of prior conviction as equitably and as impartially as be humanly possible the primary purpose of this program be the reconciliation of all people and the restoration of the essential unity of americans within which honest difference of opinion do not descend to angry discord and mutual problem be not polarize by excessive passion sincere hope be that this be a constructive step toward a calmer and cooler appreciation of individual right and responsibility and common purpose as a nation whose future be always more important than past at this point will sign the proclamation that mention in statement follow by an executive order for the establishment of follow by the signing of an executive order for the director of selective service who will have a prime responsibility in the handling of the matter involve alternate service thank very much view transcript transcript have come to a decision which feel should tell and all of fellow american citizen as soon as be certain in own mind and in own conscience that be the right thing to do have learn already in this office that the difficult decision always come to this desk must admit that many of do not look at all the same as the hypothetical question that have answer freely and perhaps too fast on previous occasion customary policy be to try and get all the fact and to consider the opinion of countryman and to take counsel with most value friend but these seldom agree and in the end the decision be mine to procrastinate to agonize and to wait for a more favorable turn of event that may never come or more compelling external pressure that may as well be wrong as right be a decision of sort and a weak and potentially dangerous course for a president to follow have promise to uphold the constitution to do what be right as god give to see the right and to do the very good that can for america have ask help and prayer not only when become president but many time since the constitution be the supreme law of land and govern action as citizen only the law of god which govern conscience be superior to as be a nation under god so be swear to uphold law with the help of god and have seek such guidance and search own conscience with special diligence to determine the right thing for to do with respect to predecessor in this place richard|nixon and loyal wife and family theirs be an american tragedy in which all have play a part could go on and on and on or someone must write the end to have conclude that only can do that and if can must there be no historic or legal precedent to which can turn in this matter none that precisely fit the circumstance of a private citizen who have resign the presidency of the|united|state but be common knowledge that serious allegation and accusation hang like a sword over former president 's head threaten health as try to reshape life a great part of which be spend in the service of this country and by the mandate of people after year of bitter controversy and divisive national debate have be advise and be compel to conclude that many|month and perhaps more year will have to pass before richard|nixon could obtain a fair trial by jury in any jurisdiction of the|united|state under govern decision of the|supreme|court deeply believe in equal justice for all americans whatever station or former station the law whether human or divine be no respecter of person but the law be a respecter of reality the fact as see be that a former president of the|united|state instead of enjoy equal treatment with any other citizen accuse of violate the law would be cruelly and excessively penalize either in preserve the presumption of innocence or in obtain a speedy determination of guilt in order to repay a legal debt to society during this long period of delay and potential litigation ugly passion would again be arouse and people would again be polarize in opinion and the credibility of free institution of government would again be challenge at home and abroad in the end the court may well hold that richard|nixon have be deny due process and the verdict of history would even more be inconclusive with respect to those charge arise out of the period of presidency of which be presently aware but be not the ultimate fate of richard|nixon that most concern though surely deeply trouble every decent and every compassionate person concern be the immediate future of this great country in this dare not depend upon personal sympathy as a long time friend of the former president nor professional judgment as a lawyer and do not as president primary concern must always be the great good of all the people of the|united|state whose servant be as a man first consideration be to be true to own conviction and own conscience conscience tell clearly and certainly that can not prolong the bad dream that continue to reopen a chapter that be closed conscience tell that only as president have the constitutional power to firmly shut and seal this book conscience tell be duty not merely to proclaim domestic tranquillity but to use every means that have to insure do believe that the buck stop here that can not rely upon public opinion poll to tell what be right do believe that right make may and that if be wrong angel swear be right would make no difference do believe with all heart and mind and spirit that not as president but as a humble servant of god will receive justice without mercy if fail to show mercy finally feel that richard|nixon and love one have suffer enough and will continue to suffer no matter what do no matter what as a great and good nation can do together to make goal of peace come true now therefore gerald|r.|ford president of the|united|state pursuant to

time have do so to discuss with some matter that believe affect the national interest in all the decision have make in public life have always try to do what be good for the nation throughout the long and difficult period of watergate have feel be duty to persevere to make every possible effort to complete the term of office to which elect in the|past|few|day however have become evident to that no longer have a strong enough political base in the congress to justify continue that effort as long as there be such a base feel strongly that be necessary to see the constitutional process through to conclusion that to do otherwise would be unfaithful to the spirit of that deliberately difficult process and a dangerously destabilizing precedent for the future but with the disappearance of that base now believe that the constitutional purpose have be serve and there be no long a need for the process to be prolong would have prefer to carry through to the finish whatever the personal agony would have involve and family unanimously urge to do so but the interest of the nation must always come before any personal consideration from the discussion have have with congressional and other leader have conclude that because of the watergate matter may not have the support of the congress that would consider necessary to back the very difficult decision and carry out the duty of this office in the way the interest of the nation will require have never be a quitter to leave office before term be complete be abhorrent to every instinct in body but as president must put the interest of america first america need a full time president and a full time congress particularly at this time with problem face at home and abroad to continue to fight through the|months|ahead for personal vindication would almost totally absorb the time and attention of both the president and the congress in a period when entire focus should be on the great issue of peace abroad and prosperity without inflation at home therefore shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow vice president ford will be swear in as president at in this office as recall the high hope for america with which begin this second term feel a great sadness that will not be here in this office work on behalf to achieve those hope in the|next|2|1/2|years but in turn over direction of the government to vice president ford know as tell the nation when nominate for that office that the leadership of america will be in good hand in pass this office to the vice president also do so with the profound sense of the weight of responsibility that will fall on shoulder tomorrow and therefore of the understanding the patience the cooperation will need from all americans as assume that responsibility will deserve the help and the support of all of as look to the future the first essential be to begin heal the wound of this nation to put the bitterness and division of the recent past behind and to rediscover those share ideal that lie at the heart of strength and unity as a great and as a free people by take this action hope that will have hasten the start of that process of healing which be so desperately need in america regret deeply any injury that may have be do in the course of the event that lead to this decision would say only that if some of judgment be wrong and some be wrong be make in what believe at the time to be the good interest of the nation to those who have stand with during these|past|difficult|month to family friend to many other who join in support cause because believe be right will be eternally grateful for support and to those who have not feel able to give support let say leave with no bitterness toward those who have oppose because all of in the final analysis have be concern with the good of the country however judgment may differ so let all now join together in affirm that common commitment and in help new president succeed for the benefit of all americans shall leave this office with regret at not complete term but with gratitude for the privilege of serve as president for the|past|5|1/2|year these|year have be a momentous time in the history of nation and the world have be a time of achievement in which can all be proud achievement that represent the share effort of the administration the congress and the people but the challenge ahead be

announce answer to the|house|judiciary|committee 's subpoena for additional watergate tape and to tell something about the action shall be take tomorrow about what hope will mean to and about the very difficult choice that be present to these action will at last once and for all show that what know and what do with regard to the watergate break in and coverup be just as have describe to from the very beginning have spend many|hour during the|past|few|week think about what would say to the american people if be to reach the decision shall announce tonight and so word have not be lightly choose can assure be deeply feel be almost|e|years|ago in june|1972 that man break into the|democratic|national|committee headquarters in washington turn out that be connect with reelection committee and the watergate break in become a major issue in the campaign the full resource of the fbi and the|justice|department be use to investigate the incident thoroughly instruct staff and campaign aide to cooperate fully with the investigation the fbi conduct nearly|1,500 interview for until march|1973â€”i be assure by those charge with conduct and monitor the investigation that no one in the|white|house be involve nevertheless for more|than|a|year there have be allegation and insinuation that know about the planning of the watergate break in and that be involve in an extensive plot to cover up the|house|judiciary|committee be now investigate these charge on march|6 order all material that have previously furnish to the special prosecutor turn over to the committee these include tape recording of presidential conversation and more|than|700 document from private white|house file on april|11 the|judiciary|committee issue a subpoena for additional tape of conversation which contend be necessary for investigation agree to respond to that subpoena by tomorrow in these folder that see over here on left be more|than|1,200 page of transcript of private conversation participate in between|september|15,|1972 and april|27|of|1973 with principal aide and associate with regard to watergate include all the relevant portion of all of the subpoenaed conversation that be record that is all portion that relate to the question of what know about watergate or the coverup and what do about also include transcript of other conversation which be not subpoena but which have a significant bearing on the question of presidential action with regard to watergate these will be deliver to the committee tomorrow in these transcript portion not relevant to knowledge or action with regard to watergate be not include but everything that be relevant be include the rough as well as the smooth the strategy session the exploration of alternative the weighing of human and political cost as far as what the president personally know and do with regard to watergate and the coverup be concern these material together with those already make available will tell all shall invite chairman rodino and the committee 's ranking minority member congressman hutchinson of michigan to come to the|white|house and listen to the actual full tape of these conversation so that can determine for beyond question that the transcript be accurate and that everything on the tape relevant to knowledge and action on watergate be include if there should be any disagreement over whether omit material be relevant shall meet with personally in an effort to settle the matter believe this arrangement be fair and think be appropriate for many|day now have spend many|hour of own time personally review these material and personally decide question of relevancy believe be appropriate that the committee 's review should also be make by own senior elect official and not by staff employee the task of chairman rodino and congressman hutchinson will be make simple than be by the fact that the work of prepare the transcript have be complete all will need to do be to satisfy of authenticity and completeness ever since the existence of the|white|house tap system be first make known last|summer have try vigorously to guard the privacy of the tape have be well aware that effort to protect the confidentiality of presidential conversation have heighten the sense of mystery about watergate and in fact have cause increase suspicion of the president many people assume that the tape must incriminate the president or that otherwise would not insist on privacy but the problem confront be this unless a president can protect the privacy of the advice get can not get the advice need this principle be recognize in the constitutional doctrine of executive privilege which have be defend and maintain by every president since washington and which have be recognize by the court whenever test as inherent in the presidency consider to be constitutional responsibility to defend this principle factor have now combine to persuade that a major unprecedented exception to that principle be now necessary first in the present circumstance the|house|of|representatives must be able to reach an informed judgment about the president 's role in watergate second be make a major exception to the principle of confidentiality because believe such action be now necessary in order to restore the principle by clear the air of the central question that have bring such pressure upon and also to provide the evidence which will allow this matter to be bring to a prompt conclusion third in the context of the current impeachment climate believe all the american people as well as representative in congress be entitle to have not only the fact but also the evidence that demonstrate those fact want there to be no question remain about the fact that the president have nothing to hide in this matter the impeachment of a president be a remedy of last resort be the most solemn act of entire constitutional process now regardless of whether or not succeed the action of the house in vote a formal accusation require trial by the senate would put the nation through a wrench ordeal have endure only once in lifetime a|century|ago and never since america have become a world power with global responsibility the impact of such an ordeal would be feel throughout the world and would have effect on the life of all americans for many|year to come because this be an issue that profoundly affect all the american people in addition to turn over these transcript to the|house|judiciary|committee have direct that should all be make public all of these that see here to complete the record shall also release to the public transcript of all those portion of the tape already turn over to the|special|prosecutor and to the committee that relate to presidential action or knowledge of the watergate affair during the|past|year the wild accusation have be give banner headline and ready credence as well rumor gossip innuendo account from unnamed source of what a prospective witness may testify to have fill the morning newspaper and then be repeat on the|evening|newscasts|day|after|day time and again a familiar pattern repeat a charge would be report the|first|day as what be â€” just an allegation but would then be refer back to the|next|day and thereafter as if be true the distinction between fact and speculation grow blur eventually all seep into the public consciousness as a vague general impression of massive wrongdoing implicate everybody gain credibility by endless repetition the basic question at issue today be whether the president personally act improperly in the watergate matter of rumor insinuation and charge by just|one watergate witness john|dean suggest that the president do act improperly this spark the demand for an impeachment inquiry this be the question that must be answer and this be the question that will be answer by these transcript that have order publish tomorrow these transcript cover hour upon hour of discussion that hold with mr. haldeman john|ehrlichman john|dean john|mitchell former attorney general kleindienst assistant attorney general petersen and other with regard to watergate be discussion in which be probe to find out what have happen who be responsible what be the various degree of responsibility what be the legal capability what be the political ramification and what action be necessary and appropriate on the part of the president realize that these transcript will provide grist for many sensational story in the press part will seem to be contradictory with another and part will be in conflict with some of the testimony give in the senate watergate committee hearing have be reluctant to release these tape not just because will embarrass and those with whom have talk which will â€” and not just because will become the subject of speculation and even ridicule which will â€” and not just because certain part of will be seize upon by political and journalistic opponent which will have be reluctant because in these and in all the other conversation in this office people have speak mind freely never dream that specific sentence or even part of sentence would be pick out as the subject of national attention and controversy have be reluctant because the principle of confidentiality be absolutely essential to the conduct of the presidency in read the raw transcript of these conversation believe will be more readily apparent why that principle be essential and must be maintain in the future these conversation be unusual in subject matter but the same kind of uninhibited discussion and be that the same brutal candor be necessary in discuss how to bring war faction to the peace table or how to move necessary legislation through the congress name be name in these transcript therefore be important to remember that much that appear in be no more than hearsay or speculation exchange as be try to find out what really have happen while principal aide be report to on rumor and report that have hear while discuss the various often conflict story that different person be tell as the transcript will demonstrate concern during this period cover a wide range the first and obvious one be to find out just exactly what have happen and who be involve a second concern be for the people who have be or may become involve in watergate some be close adviser value friend other whom have trust and be also concerned about the human impact on other especially some of the young people and family who have come to washington to work in administration whose life may be suddenly ruin by something have do in an excess of loyalty or in the mistaken belief that would serve the interest of the president and then be quite frankly concerned about the political implication this represent potentially a devastating blow to the administration and to program which know would be exploit for all be worth by hostile element in the congress as well as in the medium want to do what be right but want to do in a way that would cause the least unnecessary damage in a highly charge political atmosphere to the administration and fourth as a lawyer feel very strongly that have to conduct in a way that would not prejudice the right of potential defendant and fifth be strive to sort out a complex tangle not only of fact but also question of legal and moral responsibility want above all to be fair want to draw distinction where those be appropriate between person who be active and willing participant on the hand and on the other those who may have get inadvertently catch up in the web and be technically indictable but morally innocent despite the confusion and contradiction what do come through clearly be this john|dean charge in swear senate testimony that be fully aware of the coverup at the time of first meeting on september|15,|1972 these transcript show clearly that first learn of when mr. dean tell about in this office on march|21â€”some|6|months|later incidentally these transcript cover hours|upon|hours of conversation should place in somewhat well perspective the controversy over the gap in the tape of a conversation have with mr. haldeman back in june|of|1972 now how be cause be still a mystery to and think to many of the expert as well but be absolutely certain however of thing that be not cause intentionally by secretary rose|mary|wood or any of white|house assistant and certainly if the theory be true that during those mr. haldeman and cook up some sort of a watergate coverup scheme as so many have be quick to surmise hardly seem likely that in all of subsequent conversation many of be here â€” which neither of ever expect would see the light of day there be nothing remotely indicate such a scheme indeed quite the contrary from the beginning have say that in many place on the tape there be ambiguity a statement and comment that different people with different perspective may interpret in drastically different way but although the word may be ambiguous though the discussion may have explore many alternative the record of action be totally clear now and still believe be totally correct then a prime example be of the most controversial discussion that with mr. dean on march in which first tell of the coverup with mr. haldeman join midway through the conversation revelation to on march|21 be a sharp surprise even though the report give to be far from complete especially since do not reveal at that time the extent of own criminal involvement be particularly concern by report that of the watergate defendant howard|hunt be threaten blackmail unless and lawyer be immediately give for legal fee and family support and that be attempt to blackmail the|white|house not by threaten exposure on the watergate matter but by threaten to reveal activity that would expose extremely sensitive highly secret national security matter that have work on before watergate probe question try to learn all mr. dean know about who be involve what be involve ask more|than|150 question of mr. dean in the course of that conversation say to and quote from the transcript directly can just tell from conversation that these be thing that have no knowledge of be only considerably later that learn how much there be that do not tell then for example that have authorize promise of clemency that have personally handle money for the watergate defendant and that have suborn perjury of a witness know that need more fact know that need the judgment of more people know the fact about the watergate coverup would have to be make public but have to find out more about what be before could decide how could best be make public return several time to the immediate problem pose by mr. hunt 's blackmail threat which to be not a watergate problem but one which regard rightly or wrongly as a potential national security problem of very serious proportion consider long and hard whether may in fact be well to let the payment go forward at least temporarily in the hope that this national security matter would not be expose in the course of uncover the watergate coverup believe then and believe today that have a responsibility as president to consider every option include this one where production of sensitive national security matter be at issue protection of such matter in the course of consider and of just think out loud as put at point several time suggest that meet hunt 's demand may be necessary but then also trace through where that would lead the money could be raise but money demand would lead inescapably to clemency demand and clemency could not be grant say and quote directly from the tape be wrong that be for sure point out and quote again from the tape but in the end be go to be bleed to death and in the end be all go to come out anyway then get the bad of both world be go to lose and people be go toâ€” and mr. haldeman interrupt and say and look like dope and respond and in effect look like a coverup so that can not do now recognize that this tape of march|21 be which different meaning could be read in by different people but by the end of the meeting as the tape show decision be to convene a new grand jury and to send everyone before the grand jury with instruction to testify whatever the potential for misinterpretation there may be as a result of the different option that be discuss at different time during the meeting conclusion at the end of the meeting be clear and action and reaction as demonstrate on the tape that follow that date show clearly that do not in tend the further payment to hunt or anyone else be make these be some of the action that take in the|week that follow in effort to find the truth to carry out responsibility to enforce the law as a tape of meeting on march|22 the|next|day indicate direct mr. dean to go to camp david with instruction to put together a write report learn five|days|later on march|26 that be unable to complete and so on march|27 assign john|ehrlichman to try to find out what have happen who be at fault and in what way and to what degree of the transcript be make public be a call that mr. ehrlichman make to the attorney general on march|28 in which ask the attorney general to report to the president directly any information may find indicate possible involvement of john|mitchell or by anyone in the|white|house have mr. haldeman separately pursue other independent line of inquiry throughout be try to reach determination on matter of both substance and procedure on what the fact be and what be the good way to move the case forward conclude that want everyone to go before the grand jury and testify freely and fully this decision as will recall be publicly announce on march|30,|1973 waive executive privilege in order to permit everybody to testify specifically waive executive privilege with regard to conversation with the president and waive the attorney client privilege with john|dean in order to permit to testify fully and hope truthfully finally on april|14â€”three|week after learn of the coverup from mr. dean â€” mr ehrlichman report to on the result of investigation as

without inflation every|day absorb by watergate be a day lose from the work that must be do by president and by congress work that must be do in deal with the great problem that affect prosperity affect security that could affect life the material make public tomorrow will provide all the additional evidence need to get watergate behind and to get behind now never before in the history of the presidency have record that be so private be make so public in give these record blemish and all â€” be place trust in the basic fairness of the american people know in own heart that through the long painful and difficult process reveal in these transcript be try in that period to discover what be right and to do what be right hope and trust that when have see the evidence in entirety will see the truth of that statement as for intend to go forward to the good of ability with the work that elect to do shall do so in a spirit perhaps best sum up a|century|ago by another president when be be subject to unmerciful attack abraham|lincoln say do the very good know how â€” the very good can and mean to keep do so until the end if the end bring out all right what be say against will not amount to anything if the end bring out wrong angel swear be right would make no difference thank and good evening view transcript transcript the president lady and gentleman before go to question have a brief report on the energy situation the progress have make to date and also the problem that have in the future will recall that last|october when see the energy crisis develop as a result of the embargo and other matter that there be dire prediction that would have problem with home heating oil and even fuel to run factory as a result of the cooperation of the american people and deserve most of the credit and also the management on the part of mr. simon and organization have now pass through that crisis the home fuel oil as far as be concern as know have be furnish no one have suffer as a result and as far as plant be concern all have have the fuel that be require to keep the plant go the major problem that remain be that be bring home to when talk to of the soundman before come in ask if be have any trouble get gas say yes when go to the service station this|morning would not give any because gage be wrong think that have more|than|half a tank actually have in the tank have see this problem as have drive around in the miami area and also in the washington area the gas line the fact too that in the|eastern|state generally do have a problem of shortage of gasoline which have be of course very difficult for many people go to work go to school or what have mr. simon last|week as know at direction allocate additional gasoline for these particular area and be prepared to take more action in the future to deal with this problem as far as the entire situation be concern be able to report tonight that as a result of the cooperation of the american people as a result too of own energy conservation program within the government that now believe confidently that there be much well than an even chance that there will be no need for gas ration in the|united|state as far as that be concerned however should point out that while the crisis have pass the problem still remain and be a very serious one and have report somewhat positively up to this point let point out some of the negative situation that confront have to do with the congress the congress of course be work hard on this problem but regret to say that the bill presently before the congress be that if reach desk in present form will have to veto will have to veto because what do be simply to manage the shortage rather than to deal with the real problem and what should be real goal and that be to get rid of the shortage for example there be a provision in the bill the present bill that provide for a rollback of price now this of course would be immediately popular but would mean if do have such a rollback that would not only have more and long gas line but a rollback of price would lead to shortage which would require without question ration all over the country that would mean to more federal bureaucrat to run the system at a cost of a year and this should avoid this can avoid and that be why again urge the congress to act responsibly on the measure that have present to the congress to deal with the problem of price and profit through the windfall profit measure that have submit and to deal with the problem of gas shortage overall by get more supply and that mean the deregulation of natural gas so that be competitive as far as price be concern the amendment of some of environmental action so that can use more coal and thereby take some of the pressure off of the demand for gasoline and other fuel the deepwater port and the other measure that have mention on many occasion to the nation and also before member of the press look to the future believe can say now that while the crisis have be pass the problem remain be a serious problem but be one that can be deal with and goal of become completely independent in energy independent of any foreign source be that can achieve but will require the continued cooperation of the american people which be sure will get and responsible action by the congress action direct not simply toward distribute a shortage and make bad but action which will increase supply and thereby get rid of the shortage questions the president miss thomas think be number tonight q mr. president to heal the division in this country would be willing to waive executive privilege to give what say need to end any question of involvement in watergate the president miss thomas as know the matter of the|judiciary|committee 's investigation be now be discuss by white|house|counsel mr. st.|clair and mr. doar and as indicate in state of the|union|address be prepared to cooperate with the committee in any way consistent with constitutional responsibility to defend the|office|of|the|presidency against any action which would weaken that office and the ability of future president to carry out the great responsibility that any president will have mr. doar be conduct those negotiation with mr. st.|clair and whatever be eventually arrange which will bring a prompt resolution of this matter will cooperate in q mr. president john|dunlop the price controller have say do not think know how to restrain inflation how confident be that in the|latter|half|of|the|year can restrain inflation the president mr. cormier the problem of inflation be still a very nagging the last figure as know the one|percent increase in one|month of the consumer price index be a very troublesome look to the future be keenly aware of this problem and be prepare to deal with first believe that be vitally important to get at the source of the problem be in the field of energy the way to get at the source of the problem in the field of energy be to increase supply have already direct comment to that point the other be in the field of food and in the field of food have the same objective to increase supply and secretary butz indicate to and to other member of the cabinet and the|cost|of|living|council that expect that supply through the balance of this|year of food will go up and that that will have a restraining influence as far as food cost be concern with regard to inflation should point out too that almost|two third of the price increase the increase in price last|year which be at a very high rate be due to energy and also to the problem of food by get at these problem and by continue cost of living|council activity in the area that secretary shultz have testify to believe that will bring inflation under control as the|year go on but would not underestimate the problem be go to continue to fight be go to have to take responsibility on the part of the congress to keep the budget within the limit that have lay out be also go to take an effort on the part of farmer an effort on the part of the administration in the field of energy and the rest so that can get the supply up because the answer to high price be not simply control control have be try and control have be find want the answer to high price be to get up the supply that will bring the price down q mr. president to follow up miss thomas ' question say will cooperate with the|judiciary|committee but can not say yet precisely to what extent can tell if anticipate will be able to cooperate at least to the extent cooperate with mr. jaworski in term of turn over to the|judiciary|committee roughly the same tape and document that mr. jaworski have the president well this be a matter mr. jarriel that have be discuss by mr. st. clair with mr. doar and the decision will be make base on what arrangement be develop between the for the confidentiality of those particular item where must remain confidential and also base on whether or not turn over to the committee will in any way jeopardize the right of defendant or impair the ability of the prosecution to carry on proper function in the case that may develop be a matter that be talk about and be a matter where will be cooperative within those guideline q mr. president may follow on to colleague 's question and also to miss thomas ' question within the|past|week or the|house|judiciary|committee and the|justice|department have issue differ interpretation of what by constitutional definition be an impeachable offense for a president now as all know be an experienced student of the constitution and think people would be interested to know what consider to be an impeachable offense for a president particularly on the dividing line whether require that the house determine that believe that the president may have commit a crime or whether dereliction of duty not uphold the constitution be enough in to constitute an impeachable offense the president well mr. rather do not have to be a constitutional lawyer to know that the constitution be very precise in define what be an impeachable offense and in this respect be the opinion of white|house|counsel and a number of other constitutional lawyer who be perhaps more up to date on this than be at this time that a criminal offense on the part of the president be the requirement for impeachment this be a matter which will be present however to the committee by mr. st.|clair in a brief which presently be prepare q. mr. president would like to follow up on discussion of the energy situation when say that the crisis be end that the problem be still with think for most people the problem be wait for a long time in line for gasoline and another part of be the price of gasoline go up as have be what can tell the american people about when line for gasoline may become short under program and what do see in term of the future of the price of gasoline the president believe that the line for gasoline will become short in the|spring|and|summer|months in fact that be the purpose of program and think will achieve as far as the price of gasoline be concern would be less than candid if be not to say that the price of gasoline be not go to go down until more supply of gasoline come into the country and also until other fuel come on stream which will reduce the pressure which be upward on the price of gasoline obviously too when the embargo be lift that be and will have some effect on the price of gasoline q mr. president when do think the embargo may be lift the president the embargo question be that know be on the mind of all of and be one that presently be under consideration as know by the oil produce country should point out here that dr. kissinger 's trip to the mideast be direct toward get a disengagement or get talk start with regard to a disengagement on the syrian front that follow on the disengagement on the egyptian front think will have a positive effect although be not link to the problem of the embargo directly if could perhaps elaborate just a bit on that as far as the oil produce country be concern believe be in interest to lift the embargo should do that independently of what happen on the front of the negotiation with regard to develop a permanent peace in the mideast as far as be concerned believe that get a permanent peace in the mideast be a goal worth achieve apart from the embargo but while be not condition on another by either party what happen in area inevitably affect what happen in the other and can say base on the conversation have have with the foreign minister meet with last|week and base on the report have receive to date believe be go to make continued progress on the peace front believe that will be helpful in bring progress on get the embargo lift by the same token if the embargo be not lift will naturally slow down the effort that be make on the peace front and be because believe that be go to make progress in develop those particular item that be essential towards movement toward a permanent peace in the mideast that the oil produce country will conclude that should move on the embargo front q mr. president have the special prosecutor request testimony in any form and if ask would testify the president well believe be a matter of record that the|special|prosecutor transmit a request that testify before the grand jury and on constitutional ground respectfully decline to do so do offer of course to respond to any interrogatory that the|special|prosecutor may want to submit or to meet with personally and answer question and indicate that do not want to proceed in that way q mr. president however an impeachable offense be define under the system the impeachment proceeding be the courtroom of the president have say many time that these matter belong in court so would not be in good interest and in the good interest of the country to have this matter finally resolve in a proper judicial forum that is a full impeachment trial in the senate the president well a full impeachment trial in the senate under constitution come only when the house determine that there be an impeachable offense be belief that house after conduct inquiry will not reach that determination do not expect to be impeach q mr. president the|shah|of|iran say in an interview that the|united|states be get as much oil now as do before the embargo and mr. simon of the|federal|energy|office say that such a statement be irresponsible and reckless can straighten out be get as much oil and why would the shah say this the president first would not say that the shah be irresponsible and reckless however information think be different from our and have good reason to know what be get be get substantially less from the oil produce country in the mideast than be before the embargo that be why be of course very anxious to get the embargo lift as soon as possible q mr. president have tell the american people that there will be no recession this|year if the unemployment rate should go above|5|1/2|percent of the labor force what do plan to do about this as an antirecession move and would that include a tax cut the president with regard to statement that there will be no recession have meet with economic adviser just|last|week go over this question in great detail be go through what would say be a downturn in the economy at this point but not a recession and for the balance of the|year the prospect be good be good because be go to be deal with the energy crisis what be a crisis as a problem that will be helpful expect to have an increase insofar as food be concern and as far as other element of the economy be concern there be very great area of strength the|last|half|of|the|year expect to be on an upward curve rather than the down curve however those be projection make by economist and give direction to the|office|of|management|and|budget mr. ash and to economic adviser that will be and should be prepare to deal effectively with any area of the country and there may be spot area of hardship through the budget mean and have various contingency plan ready to go will not stand by and allow this country because of the energy crisis and because of some of the problem have have on the inflation front â€” stand by and allow a recession to occur that be why have be so positive in say that there will be no recession have well turn this way q mr. president sir want to ask something think be the president to sarah|mcclendon mcclendon|news|service have the loud voice go right ahead q good thank sir do not think be fully informed about some of the thing that be happen in the government in a domestic way be sure be not fault but maybe the people that appoint to office be not give right information for example have just discover that the|veterans|administration have absolutely no mean of tell precisely what be the national problem regard the payment of check to boy go to school under gi bill and many a young man in this country be be disillusion totally by government these|days because of the hardship be put upon the president well this be a question which very properly bring to the attention of the nation be a question that have already be bring to attention be sure by a number of people q but sir have mr.â€” the president:â€”and the question if may give the answer now be very simply this mr. don|johnson of the|veterans|administration as know act expeditiously when have a case in california have another one in illinois at the present time there be great number of veteran have an adequate program to deal with and can assure that when any matter be bring to attention or to will deal with as quickly as can because vietnam veteran and all veteran deserve whatever the law provide for and will see that get q be the very man be talk about who be not give the correct information stand up here at the|white|house the|other|day and give false information have no real system for get at the statistic on this problem the president well if be not listen to this program will report to just what say laughter may have hear even though be not listen to the program laughter q mr. president this be a political question the president the other be not political laughter q jerry|ford 's old house seat be win by a democrat who campaign mainly on the theme that should be remove or impeach or that should resign what advice could give republican candidate this|year to counter that argument the president first want republican candidate to win where be deserve candidate and second recall when confidently expect to gain in the house and when mr. fulbright as may recall call for president truman 's resignation in the|spring because the economy be in a slump and president truman have other problem and proceed to campaign against mr. truman be the issue and take a bad licking in the congress in what advice to the candidate very simply would be be this be that before an election no one can predict what can happen in this country what will affect the election in this|year|1974 be what always affect election â€” peace and prosperity on the peace front be do well and think will continue to do well with regard to the prosperity issue the bread and butter issue as have already indicate think that this economy be go to be move up think therefore will be for those candidate who stand for the administration q mr. president as prepare to sign income tax return for this|year do intend to pay state or local income taxis and have have any second thought about claim deduction for the gift of the vice presidential paper the president with regard to any state taxis or concern will pay any that the law require as understand in california a ruling have be make apparently that even though have a residence in california that there be not a requirement that pay california taxis would be glad to pay those taxis and of course deduct that from federal income tax liability as other can do if desire to do so with regard to the gift of paper that make to the government there be no question about intent all of vice presidential paper be deliver to the archives in march before the deadline the paperwork on apparently be not conclude until after that time this raise a legal question as to whether or not the deduction therefore be proper that be why voluntarily ask the senate control committee of the house and senate to look into the matter and to advise as to whether or not the deduction be a proper one if be not a proper one of course will be glad to pay the tax q mr. president what be personal reaction to the expulsion by the|soviet|union|of|alexander|solzhenitsyn and will any way affect policy of detente the president well personal reaction be that be of course an admirer of a man who have win a|nobel|prize for literature and who have also show as have show such great courage second as far as relation with the soviets be concern if think that break relation with the soviets or turn off policy of negotiation and turn back to confrontation would help or help thousand of other like in the|soviet|union may do that on the other hand look back to the|year of confrontation and find that man like as a matter of fact rather than be send to paris would have be send to siberia or probably bad as far as relation with the soviets be concern shall continue shall continue to negotiate recognize that do not like system or approve of and do not like system or approve of mr. brezhnev know that and know and have discuss quite bluntly and directly however be essential that both nation be the super power that be continue to make progress toward limit arm toward avoid confrontation which may explode into war as may have in the mideast if have not have this period of negotiation and also continue those negotiation for reduction of force in europe and reduction of arm or certainly the limitation of arm and the various other initiative that be undertake with the soviets in a nutshell this be what have to consider do want to go back to a period when the|united|state and the|soviet|union the great super power stand in confrontation against each other and risk a runaway nuclear arm race and also crisis in berlin in the mideast even again in southeast|asia or other place of the world or do want to continue on a path in which recognize difference but try to recognize also the fact that must either live together or will all die together q mr. president have say on many occasion that would not resign from the office to which be elect but what if within the|next|few|month become evident that party be go to suffer a disastrous defeat in this year 's election would then reconsider resolve on this the president no want party to succeed but more important want the presidency to survive and be vitally important in this nation that the presidency of the|united|state not be hostage to what happen to the popularity of a president at time or another the stability of this office the ability of the president to continue to govern the ability for example of this president to continue the great initiative which have lead to a more peaceful world than have have for a generation and to move on the domestic front in the many area that have describe all of these thing these goal be yet before have a lot of work leave to do more|than|3|years leave to do and be go to stay here until get do q mr. president have make a very strong defense on the confidentiality of presidential document and other matter and have launch a program to protect the privacy of citizen of the|united|state in light of this would explain how happen to issue an executive order last|year once modify to allow the|agriculture|department to examine key point of individual income tax return of america 's farmer and a justice|department advisory opinion say that this executive order should serve as a model for all the federal|government department the president well as a matter of fact in the privacy message which as know issue on saturday do not raise this question specifically but certainly want that question along with other consider because in this whole area of privacy be not just a question of those who run credit bureau and bank and other with huge computer but the|federal|government in activity can very much impinge on the privacy of individual this be a matter that think should be consider by the commission that have appoint which be chair as know by the vice president q thank mr. president personal lawyer mr. herb|kalmbach enter a plea of guilty today to a criminal charge of accept in exchange for an ambassadorial post in capacity as president approve of ambassador and send the nomination to the senate be consult in any manner on this engagement and this contribution by mr. kalmbach or anyone else in the|white|house and have do any research on this in the|white|house to determine who be responsible for the president the answer to the first question be no the answer to the second question be yes and would go further and say that ambassadorship have not be for sale to knowledge ambassadorship can not be purchase and would not approve an ambassadorship unless the man or woman be qualified clearly apart from any contribution q mr. president at last meeting be remiss in ask for reaction to the resignation of vice president agnew and so for the sake of fill in that hiatus in the record would ask if believe that the conduct of the vice president and particularly conduct surround and lead up to resignation in fact bring dishonor upon office this administration and the country the president would be very easy for to jump on the vice president when be down can only say that in period of service that render dedicated service in all of the assignment that give to go through along with family a terribly difficult situation and resign as think think should because of the embarrassment that know that would cause to the administration and also because feel that in view of the criminal offense that be charge that should not stay in office now at this point be not go to join anybody else in kick when be down q mr. president thank very much to follow on an early question about taxis april|21,|1969 be a|significant|day for in taxis and for the country too that be the notary date on the deed that allow to give paper to the government and pay just token taxis for e year on that same date have a tax reform message in which say and quote special preference in the law permit far too many americans to pay less than fair share of taxis too many other bear too much of the tax burden now mr. president do think pay fair share of taxis the president well would point out that those who make deduction such as make in this particular instance include john|kenneth|galbraith jerome|wiesner vice president humphrey president johnson a number of other do not write that law when be bring to attention rather vigorously by president johnson when see shortly after election think that would be wise for to give paper to the government and take the proper deduction do that under the circumstance as know now that deduction be no longer allow as far as be concern think that be probably a proper decision q in state of the|union|address mention that arab leader have assure that be call an urgent meeting to discuss or consider the lifting of the embargo be mislead by the arab leader or what happen to that meeting the president mr. lisagor be inform that be call an urgent meeting expect that to take place on the|14th|of|february but the arab leader as know be not a united group necessarily and that be an understatement under the circumstance while the arab leader who have give this assurance try to go forward with the meeting be unable to get the cooperation of other believe now however that will get that cooperation that the meeting will be hold and believe that will lift the embargo view transcript transcript mr. speaker mr. president colleague in the congress distinguished guest fellow americans meet here tonight at a time of great challenge and great opportunity for

prevent the injustice of windfall profit for a few as a result of the sacrifice of the million of americans and will give the organization the incentive the authority need to deal with the short term emergency and to move toward meet long term need just|as|1970 be the|year in which begin a full scale effort to protect the environment must be the|year in which organize a full scale effort to

country for the energy need to provide job to heat home and to keep transportation move to indicate the size of the government commitment to spur energy research and development plan to spend in federal fund over that be an enormous amount but during private enterprise will be invest as|much|as|$200|billion and in to develop the new resource the new technology the new capacity america will require for energy need in the|1980s that be just a measure of the magnitude of the project be undertake but america perform best when call to big task can truly be say that only in america could a task so tremendous be achieve so quickly and achieve not by regimentation but through the effort and ingenuity of a free people work in a free system turn now to the rest of the agenda for the time be at hand this|year to bring comprehensive high quality health care within the reach of every american shall propose a sweeping new program that will assure comprehensive health insurance protection to million of americans who can not now obtain or afford with vastly improve protection against catastrophic illness this will be a plan that maintain the high standard of quality in america 's health care and will not require additional taxis now recognize that other plan have be put forward that would cost or even and that would put whole health care system under the heavy hand of the federal government this be the wrong approach this have be try abroad and have fail be not the way do thing here in america this kind of plan would threaten the quality of care provide by whole health care system the right way be one that build on the strength of the present system and one that do not destroy those strength base on partnership not paternalism most important of all let keep this as the guide principle of health program government have a great role to play but must always make sure that doctor will be work for patient and not for the federal government many of will recall that in state of the union address comment that most americans today be simply feed up with government at all level and recommend a sweeping set of proposal to revitalize state and local government to make more responsive to the people serve can report to today that as a result of revenue sharing pass by the congress and other measure have make progress toward that goal after of move power from the state and the community to washington d.c. have begin move power back from washington to the state and community and most important to the people of america in this session of the congress believe be near the breakthrough point on effort which have suggest proposal to let people make own decision for own community and in particular on those to provide broad new flexibility in federal aid for community development for economic development for education and look forward to work with the congress with member of both party in resolve whatever remain difference have in this legislation so that can make available nearly|$5.5|billion to state and locality to use not for what a federal bureaucrat may want but for what own people in those community want the decision should be think all of recognize that the energy crisis have give new urgency to the need to improve public transportation not only in city but in rural area as well the program have propose this|year will give community not only more money but also more freedom to balance own transportation need will mark the strong federal commitment ever to the improvement of mass transit as an essential element of the improvement of life in town and city goal on which all americans agree be that child should have the very good education this great nation can provide in a special message last|week recommend a number of important new measure that can make a year of truly significant advance for school and for the child serve if the congress will act on these proposal more flexible funding will enable each federal dollar to meet well the particular need of each particular school district advance funding will give school authority a chance to make each year 's plan know ahead of time what federal fund be go to receive special targeting will give special help to the truly disadvantaged among people college student face with rise cost for education will be able to draw on an expand program of loan and grant these advance be a need investment in america 's most precious resource next generation and urge the congress to act on this legislation in measure of a truly free society be the vigor with which protect the liberty of individual citizen as technology have advance in america have increasingly encroach on of those liberty what term the right of personal privacy modern information system datum bank credit record mailing list abuse electronic snooping the collection of personal datum for purpose that may be use for another all these have leave million of americans deeply concerned by the privacy cherish and the time have come therefore for a major initiative to define the nature and extent of the basic right of privacy and to erect new safeguard to ensure that those right be respect shall launch such an effort this|year at the high level of the administration and look forward again to work with this congress in establish a new set of standard that respect the legitimate need of society but that also recognize personal privacy as a cardinal principle of american liberty many of those in this chamber tonight will recall that be that term the nation 's welfare system a monstrous consume outrage an outrage against the community against the taxpayer and particularly against the child that be suppose to help that system be still an outrage by improve administration have be able to reduce some of the abuse as a result last|year for the first time in there have be a halt in the growth of the welfare caseload but as a system welfare program still need reform as urgently today as do when first propose in that completely replace with a different system in these final three|year of administration urge the congress to join in mount a major new effort to replace the discredit present welfare system with that work that be fair to those who need help or can not help fair to the community and fair to the taxpayer and let have as goal that there will be no government program which make more profitable to go on welfare than to go to work recognize that from the debate that have take place within the congress over the|past|three|years on this program that can not expect enactment overnight of a new reform but do propose that the congress and the administration together make this the|year in which discuss debate and shape such a reform so that can be enact as quickly as possible america 's own prosperity in the|years|ahead depend on sharing fully and equitably in an expand world prosperity historic negotiation will take place this|year that will enable to ensure fair treatment in international market for american worker american farmer american investor and american consumer be vital that the authority contain in the trade bill submit to the congress be enact so that the|united|states can negotiate flexibly and vigorously on behalf of american interest these negotiation can usher in a new era of international trade that not only increase the prosperity of all nation but also strengthen the peace among all nation in have make more progress toward a lasting structure of peace in the world than in any comparable time in the nation 's history could not have make that progress if have not maintain the military strength of america thomas|jefferson once observe that the price of liberty be eternal vigilance by the same token and for the same reason in today 's world the price of peace be a strong defense as far as the|united|state be concern in have steadily reduce the burden of national defense as a share of the budget bring down from in to in the|current|year have cut military manpower over the|past|five|years by more|than|a|third from to in the|coming|year however increased expenditure will be need will be need to assure the continued readiness of military force to preserve present force level in the face of rise cost and to give the military strength must have if security be to be maintain and if initiative for peace be to succeed the question be not whether can afford to maintain the necessary strength of defense the question be whether can afford not to maintain and the answer to that question be no must never allow america to become the second strong nation in the world do not say this with any sense of belligerence because recognize the fact that be recognize around the world america 's military strength have always be maintain to keep the peace never to break have always be use to defend freedom never to destroy the world 's peace as well as own depend on remain as strong as need to be as long as need to be in this|year|1974 will be negotiate with the|soviet|union to place further limit on strategic nuclear arm together with ally will be negotiate with the nation of the|warsaw|pact on mutual and balanced reduction of force in europe and will continue effort to promote peaceful economic development in latin|america in africa in asia will press for full compliance with the peace accord that bring an end to american fighting in indochina include particularly a provision that promise the full possible accounting for those americans who be miss in action and have in mind the energy crisis to which have refer to earlier will be work with the other nation of the world toward agreement on mean by which oil supply can be assure at reasonable price on a stable basis in a fair way to the consume and produce nation alike all of these be step toward a future in which the world 's peace and prosperity and ours as well as a result be make more secure throughout the|five|years that have serve as president have have override aim and that be to establish a new structure of peace in the world that can free future generation of the scourge of war can understand that other may have different priority this have be and this will remain first priority and the chief legacy hope to leave from the|eight|years of presidency this do not mean that shall not have other priority because as strengthen the peace must also continue each|year a steady strengthening of society here at home conscience require interest require and must insist upon as create more job as build a well health care system as improve education as develop new source of energy as provide more abundantly for the elderly and the poor as strengthen the system of private enterprise that produce prosperity as do all of this and even more solidify those essential bond that hold together as a nation even more importantly advance what in the final analysis government in america be all about what be all about be more freedom more security a well life for each of the people that live in this land can not afford to neglect progress at home while pursue peace abroad but neither can ave afford to neglect peace abroad while pursue progress at home with a stable peace all be possible but without peace nothing be possible in the write message that have just deliver to the speaker and to the president of the senate comment that of the continue challenge face in the legislative process be that of the timing and pacing of initiative select each year among many worthy project those that be

course to the investigation of the so call watergate affair as know have provide to the|special|prosecutor voluntarily a great deal of material believe that have provide all the material that need to conclude investigation and to proceed to prosecute the guilty and to clear the innocent believe the time have come to bring that investigation and the other investigation of this matter to an end one|year of watergate be enough and the time have come colleague for not only the executive the president but the member of congress for all of to join together in devote full energy to these great issue that have discuss tonight which involve the welfare of all of the american people in so many different way as well as the peace of the world recognize that the|house|judiciary|committee have a special responsibility in this area and want to indicate on this occasion that will cooperate with the|judiciary|committee in investigation will cooperate so that can conclude investigation make decision and will cooperate in any way that consider consistent with responsibility to the|office|of|the|presidency of the|united|state there be only|one limitation will follow the precedent that have

president of the future to make the great decision that be so essential to this nation and the world another point should like to make very briefly like every member of the house and senate assemble

and want to know that have no intention whatever of ever walk away from the job that the people elect to do for the people of the|united|state now needless to say would be understatement if be not to

present but colleague this believe with the help of god who have bless this land so richly with the cooperation of the congress and with the support of the american people can and will make the|year|1974|a|year of unprecedented progress toward goal of build a structure of last peace in the world and a new prosperity without war in the|united|states|of|america view transcript transcript good evening now that most of the major witness in the watergate phase of the senate committee hearing on campaign practice have be hear the time have come for to speak out about the charge make and to provide a perspective on the issue for the american people for over|four|month watergate have dominate the news media during the|past|three|months the major network have devote an average of over|22|hour of television time each|week to this subject the senate committee have hear over|2|million word of testimony this investigation begin as an effort to discover the fact about the break in and bugging of the|democratic|national|headquarter and other campaign abuse but as the|week have go by have become clear that both the hearing and some of the commentary on have become increasingly absorb in an effort to implicate the president personally in the illegal activity that take place because the abuse occur during administration and in the campaign for reelection accept full responsibility for regret that these event take place and do not question the right of a senate committee to investigate charge make against the president to the extent that this be relevant to legislative duty however be constitutional responsibility to defend the integrity of this great office against false charge also believe that be important to address the overriding question of what as a nation can learn from this experience and what should now do intend to discuss both of these subject tonight the record of the senate hearing be lengthy the fact be complicate the evidence conflict would not be right for to try to sort out the evidence to rebut specific witness or to pronounce own judgment about credibility that be for the committee and for the court shall not attempt to deal tonight with the various charge in detail rather shall attempt to put the event in perspective from the standpoint of the presidency on may|22 before the major witness have testify issue a detailed statement address the charge that have be make against the president have today issue another write statement which address the charge that have be make since then as relate to own conduct and which describe the effort that make to discover the fact about the matter on may|22 state in very specific term and state again to every of listen tonight these fact have no prior knowledge of the watergate break in neither take part in nor know about any of the subsequent coverup activity neither authorize nor encouraged subordinate to engage in illegal or improper campaign tactic that be and that be the simple truth in all of the million of word of testimony there be not the slight suggestion that have any knowledge of the planning for the watergate break in as for the coverup statement have be challenge by only|one of the witness who appear â€” a witness who offer no evidence beyond own impression and whose testimony have be contradict by every other witness in a position to know the fact tonight let explain to what do about watergate after the break in occur so that can better understand the fact that also have no knowledge of the so call coverup from the time when the break in occur press repeatedly to know the fact and particularly whether there be any involvement of anyone in the|white|house consider thing essential first that the investigation should be thorough and aboveboard and that if there be any high involvement should get the fact out first as say at august|29 press conference last|year what really hurt in matter of this sort be not the fact that occur because over zealous people in campaign do thing that be wrong what really hurt be if try to cover up believe that then and certainly the experience of this|last|year have prove that to be true know that the|justice|department and the fbi be conduct intensive investigation as have insist that should the|white|house|counsel john|dean be assign to monitor these investigation and particularly to check into any possible white|house involvement throughout the|summer|of|1972 continue to press the question and continue to get the same answer be tell again and again that there be no indication that any person be involve other than the who be know to have plan and carry out the operation and who be subsequently indict and convict on september|12 at a meeting that hold with the cabinet the senior white|house staff and a number of legislative leader attorney general kleindienst report on the investigation tell have be the most extensive investigation since the assassination of president kennedy and that have establish that only those be involve on september|15 the day the be indict meet with john|dean the|white|house|counsel give no reason whatever to believe that any other be guilty assume that the indictment of only the by the grand jury confirm the report have be give to that effect throughout the|summer on february|16 meet with acting director gray prior to submit name to the senate for confirmation as permanent director of the fbi stress to that would be question closely about the fbi 's conduct of the watergate investigation ask if still have full confidence in reply that do that be proud of thoroughness and that could defend with enthusiasm before the committee because trust the agency conduct the investigation because believe the report be get do not believe the newspaper account that suggest a coverup be convince there be no coverup because be convince that no one have anything to cover up be not until march|21|of|this|year that receive new information from the|white|house|counsel that lead to conclude that the report have be get for over|9|month be not true on that|day launch an intensive effort of own to get the fact and to get the fact out whatever the fact may be want the|white|house to be the first to make public at first entrust the task of get the fact to mr. dean when after spend a|week at camp|david fail to produce the write report have ask for turn to john|ehrlichman and to the attorney general â€” while also make independent inquiry of own by mid - april have receive mr. ehrlichman 's report and also from the attorney general base on new information uncover by the|justice|department these report make clear to that the situation be far more serious than have imagine at once become evident to that the responsibility for the investigation in the case should be give to the|criminal|division|of|the|justice|department turn over all the information have to the head of that department assistant attorney general henry|petersen a career government employee with an impeccable nonpartisan record and instruct to pursue the matter thoroughly order all member of the administration to testify fully before the grand jury and with concurrence on may|18 attorney general richardson appoint a special prosecutor to handle the matter and the case be now before the grand jury far from try to hide the fact effort throughout have be to discover the fact and to lay those fact before the appropriate law enforcement authority so that justice could be do and the guilty deal with rely on the good law enforcement agency in the country to find and report the truth believe have do so â€” just as believe have do so many have urge that in order to help prove the truth of what have say should turn over to the|special|prosecutor and the senate committee recording of conversation that hold in office or on telephone however a much more important principle be involve in this question than what the tape may prove about watergate each|day a president of the|united|state be require to make difficult decision on grave issue be absolutely necessary if the president be to be able to do job as the country expect that be able to talk openly and candidly with adviser about issue and individual this kind of frank discussion be only possible when those who take part in know that what say be in strictest confidence the presidency be not the only office that require confidentiality a member of congress must be able to talk in confidence with assistant judge must be able to confer in confidence with law clerk and with each other for very good reason no branch of government have ever compel disclosure of confidential conversation between officer of other branch of government and adviser about government business would want to talk frankly about the congressional horse trading that may get a vital bill pass no one would want to speak bluntly about public figure here and abroad that be why shall continue to oppose effort which would set a precedent that would cripple all future president by inhibit conversation between and those look to for advice this principle of confidentiality of presidential conversation be at stake in the question of these tape must and shall oppose any effort to destroy this principle which be so vital to the conduct of this great office turn now to the basic issue which have be raise by watergate recognize that merely answer the charge that have be make against the president be not enough the word watergate have come to represent a much broad set of concern to most of watergate have come to mean not just a burglary and bugging of party headquarter but a whole series of act that either represent or appear to represent an abuse of trust have come to stand for excessive partisanship for enemy list for effort to use the great institution of government for partisan political purpose for many americans the term watergate also have come to include a number of national security matter that have be bring into the investigation such as those involve in effort to stop massive leak of vital diplomatic and military secret and to counter the wave of bombing and burning and other violent assault of just|a|few|years|ago let speak first of the political abuse know from long experience that a political campaign be always a hard and a tough contest a candidate for high office have an obligation to party to supporter and to the cause represent must always put forth good effort to win but also have an obligation to the country to conduct that contest within the law and within the limit of decency no political campaign ever justify obstruct justice or harass individual or compromise those great agency of government that should and must be above politic to the extent that these thing be do in the campaign be serious abuse and deplore practice of that kind do not represent what believe government should be or what believe politic should be in a free society the institution of government belong to the people must never be use against the people and in the future administration will be more vigilant in ensure that such abuse do not take place and that official at every level understand that be not to take place and reject the cynical view that politics be inevitably or even usually a dirty business let not allow what a few overzealous people do in watergate to tar the reputation of the million of dedicated americans of both party who fight hard but clean for the candidate of choice in by unselfish effort these people make system work and keep america free pledge to tonight that will do all that can to ensure that of the result of watergate be a new level of political decency and integrity in america in which what have be wrong in politic no longer corrupt or demean what be right in politic let turn now to the difficult question that arise in protect the national security be important to recognize that these be difficult question and that reasonable and patriotic man and woman may differ on how should be answer only|last|year the|supreme|court say that implicit in the president 's constitutional duty be the power to protect government against those who would subvert or overthrow by unlawful mean how to carry out this duty be often a delicate question to which there be no easy answer for example every president since world|war|ii have believe that in internal security matter the president have the power to authorize wiretap without first obtain a search warrant an act of congress in have seem to recognize such power last|year the|supreme|court hold to the contrary and administration be of course now comply with that decision but until the|supreme|court speak have be act as do predecessor president truman president eisenhower president kennedy and president johnson â€” in a reasonable belief that in certain circumstance the constitution permit and sometimes even require such measure to protect the national security in the public interest although be the president 's duty to protect the security of the country of course must be extremely careful in the way go about this for if lose liberty will have little use for security instance have now come to light in which a zeal for security do go too far and do interfere impermissibly with individual liberty be essential that such mistake not be repeat but be also essential that do not overreact to particular mistake by tie the president 's hand in a way that would risk sacrifice security and with all liberty shall continue to meet constitutional responsibility to protect the security of this nation so that americans may enjoy freedom but shall and can do so by constitutional mean in way that will not threaten that freedom as look at watergate in a long perspective can see that abuse result from the assumption by those involve that cause place beyond the reach of those rule that apply to other person and that hold a free society together that attitude can never be tolerate in country however do not suddenly develop in the|year|1972 become fashionable in the 's as individual and group increasingly assert the right to take the law into own hand insist that purpose represent a high morality then attitude be praise in the press and even from some of pulpit as evidence of a new idealism those of who insist on the old restraint who warn of the overriding importance of operate within the law and by the rule be accuse of be reactionary that same attitude bring a rise spiral of violence and fear of riot and arson and bombing all in the name of peace and in the name of justice political discussion turn into savage debate free speech be brutally suppress as heckler shout down or even physically assault those with whom disagree serious people raise serious question about whether could survive as a free democracy the notion that the end justify the mean prove contagious thus be not surprising even though be deplorable that some person in adopt the morality that have rightly condemn and commit act that have no place in political system those act can not be defend those who be guilty of abuse must be punish but ultimately the answer do not lie merely in the jailing of a few overzealous person who mistakenly think cause justify violation of the law rather lie in a commitment by all of to show a renew respect for the mutual restraint that be the mark of a free and a civilized society require that learn once again to work together if not united in all of purpose then at least unite in respect for the system by which conflict be peacefully resolve and liberty maintain if there be law disagree with let work to change but let obey until be change if have disagreement over government policy let work those out in a decent and civilized way within the law and with respect for difference must recognize that excess beget another and that the extreme of violence and discord in the 's contribute to the extreme of watergate both be wrong both should be condemn no individual no group and no political party have a corner on the market on morality in america if learn the important lesson of watergate if do what be necessary to prevent such abuse in the future on both side can emerge from this experience a well and a strong nation let turn now to an issue that be important above all else and that be critically affect life today and will affect life and child 's life in the|year to come after and two|million word of televise testimony have reach a point at which a continued backward look obsession with watergate be cause this nation to neglect matter of far great importance to all of the american people must not stay so mired in watergate that fail to respond to challenge of surpass importance to america and the world can not let an obsession with the past destroy hope for the future legislation vital to health and well being sit unattended on the congressional calendar confidence at home and abroad in economy currency foreign policy be be sap by uncertainty critical negotiation be take place on strategic weapon and on troop level in europe that can affect the security of this nation and the peace of the world long after watergate be forget vital event be take place in southeast|asia which could lead to a tragedy for the cause of peace these be matter that can not wait cry out for action now and either elect representative here in washington ought to get on with the job that need to be do for or every of ought to be demand to know why the time have come to turn watergate over to the court where the question of guilt or innocence belong the time have come for the rest of to get on with the urgent business of nation last|november the american people be give the clear choice of this|century vote be a mandate which accept to complete the initiative begin in first term and to fulfill the promise make for second term this administration be elect to control inflation to reduce the power and size of government to cut the cost of government so that can cut the cost of living to preserve and defend those fundamental value that have make america great to keep the nation 's military strength second to none to achieve peace with honor in southeast|asia and to bring home prisoner of war to build a new prosperity without inflation and without war to create a structure of peace in the world that would endure long after be go these be great goal be worthy of a great people and would not be true to trust if let be turn aside from achieve those goal if share belief in these goal if want the mandate give this administration to be carry out then ask for help to ensure that those who would exploit watergate in order to keep from do what be elect to do will not succeed ask tonight for understanding so that as a nation can learn the lesson of watergate and gain from that experience ask for help in reaffirm dedication to the principle of decency honor and respect for the institution that have sustain progress through these|past|two|centurie and ask for support in get on once again with meet problem improve life build future with help with god 's help will achieve

false the comment make during this period and the comment make by press secretary in behalf be base on the information provide to at the time make those comment however new information then come to which persuade that there be a real possibility that some of these charge be true and suggest further that there have be an effort to conceal the fact both from the public from and from as a result on march|21 personally assume the responsibility for coordinate intensive new inquiry into the matter and personally order those conduct the investigation to get all the fact and to report directly to right here in this office again order that all person in the government or at the|re election|committee should cooperate fully with the fbi the prosecutor and the grand jury also order that anyone who refuse to cooperate in tell the truth would be ask to resign from government service and with ground rule adopt that would preserve the basic constitutional separation of power between the congress and the presidency direct that member of the|white|house staff should appear and testify voluntarily under oath before the senate committee which be investigate watergate be determine that should get to the bottom of the matter and that the truth should be fully bring out no matter who be involve at the same time be determine not to take precipitate action and to avoid if at all possible any action that would appear to reflect on innocent people want to be fair but know that in the final analysis the integrity of this office public faith in the integrity of this office would have to take priority over all personal consideration today in of the most difficult decision of presidency accept the resignation of of close associate in the|white|house â€” bob|haldeman john|ehrlichman of the fine public servant have be privilege to know want to stress that in accept these resignation mean to leave no implication whatever of personal wrongdoing on part and leave no implication tonight of implication on the part of other who have be charge in this matter but in matter as sensitive as guard the integrity of democratic process be essential not only that rigorous legal and ethical standard be observe but also that the public have total confidence that be both be observe and enforce by those in authority and particularly by the president of the|united|state agree with that this move be necessary in order to restore that confidence because attorney general kleindienst â€” though a distinguished public servant personal friend for with no personal involvement whatever in this matter â€” have be a close personal and professional associate of some of those who be involve in this case and both feel that be also necessary to name a new attorney general the counsel to the president john|dean have also resign as the new attorney general have today name elliot|richardson a man of unimpeachable integrity and rigorously high principle have direct to do everything necessary to ensure that the|department|of|justice have the confidence and the trust of every law abide person in this country have give absolute authority to make all decision bear upon the prosecution of the watergate case and related matter have instruct that if should consider appropriate have the authority to name a special supervising prosecutor for matter arise out of the case whatever may appear to

as president justice will be pursue fairly fully and impartially no matter who be involve this office be a sacred trust and be determined to be worthy of that trust look back at the history of this case question arise how could have happen who be to blame political commentator have correctly observe that during in politic have always previously insist on run own campaign for office but present a very different situation in both domestic and foreign policy be a|year of crucially important decision of intense negotiation of vital new direction particularly in work toward the goal which have be overriding concern throughout political career the goal of bring peace to america peace to the world that be why decide as the campaign approach that the presidency should come first and politic second to the maximum extent possible therefore seek to delegate campaign operation to remove the day to day campaign decision from the president 's office and from the|white|house also as recall severely limit the number of own campaign appearance who then be to blame for what happen in this case for specific criminal action by specific individual those who commit those action must of course bear the liability and pay the penalty for the fact that allege improper action take place within the|white|house or within campaign organization the easy course would be for to blame those to whom delegate the responsibility to run the campaign but that would be a cowardly thing to do will not place the blame on subordinate on people whose zeal exceed judgment and who may have do wrong in a cause deeply believe to be right in any organization the man at the top must bear the responsibility that responsibility therefore belong here in this office accept and pledge to tonight from this office that will do everything in power to ensure that the guilty be bring to justice and that such abuse be purge from political process in the|year to come long after have leave this office some people quite properly appal at the abuse that occur will say that watergate demonstrate the bankruptcy of the american political system believe precisely the opposite be true watergate represent a series of illegal act and bad judgment by a number of individual be the system that have bring the fact to light and that will bring those guilty to justice a system that in this case have include a determine grand jury honest prosecutor a courageous judge john|sirica and a vigorous free press be essential now that place faith in that system and especially in the judicial system essential that let the judicial process go forward respect those safeguard that be establish to protect the innocent as well as to convict the guilty be essential that in react to the excess of other not fall into excess be also essential that not be so distract by event such as this that neglect the vital work before before this nation before america at a time of critical importance to america and the world since march when first learn that the|watergate|affair may in fact be far more serious than have be lead to believe have claim far too much of time and attention whatever may now transpire in the case

that hold and owe to to country know that as attorney general elliot|richardson will be both fair and will be fearless in pursue this case wherever lead be confident that with in charge justice will

invasion that be make possible by tank artillery and other advanced offensive weapon supply to hanoi by the|soviet|union and other communist nation the south|vietnamese have fight bravely to repel this brutal assault casualty on both side have be very high most tragically there have be over civilian casualty include woman and child in the city which the north|vietnamese have shell in wanton disregard of human life as announce in report to the nation the role of the|united|state in resist this invasion have be limit to air and naval strike on military target in north|and south vietnam as also point out in that report have respond to north|vietnam 's massive military offensive by undertake wide range new peace effort aim at end the war through negotiation on april|20 send dr. kissinger to moscow for of meeting with general secretary brezhnev and other soviet leader instruct to emphasize desire for a rapid solution to the war and willingness to look at all possible approach at that time the soviet leader show an interest in bring the war to an end on a basis just to both side urge resumption of negotiation in paris and indicate would use constructive influence authorize dr. kissinger to meet privately with the top north|vietnamese negotiator le|duc|tho on tuesday may|2 in paris ambassador porter as know resume the public peace negotiation in paris on april|27 and again on at those meeting both public and private all hear from the enemy be bombastic rhetoric and a replaying of demand for surrender for example at the may|2 secret meeting authorize dr. kissinger to talk about every conceivable avenue toward peace the north|vietnamese flatly refuse to consider any of these approach refuse to offer any new approach of own instead simply read verbatim previous public demand here be what over 3|year of public and private negotiation with hanoi have come down to the|united|state with the full concurrence of south|vietnamese ally have offer the maximum of what any president of the|united|state could offer have offer a deescalation of the fighting have offer a cease fire with a deadline for withdrawal of all american force have offer new election which would be internationally supervise with the communists participate both in the supervisory body and in the election president thieu have offer to resign one|month before the election have offer an exchange of prisoner of war in a ratio of north|vietnamese prisoner for every american prisoner that release and north|vietnam have meet each of these offer with insolence and insult have flatly and arrogantly refuse to negotiate an end to the war and bring peace answer to every peace offer have make have be to escalate the war in the|2|week alone since offer to resume negotiation hanoi have launch new military offensive in south|vietnam in those|2|week the risk that a communist government may be impose on the people of south|vietnam have increase and the communist offensive have now reach the point that gravely threaten the life of american troop who be still in vietnam there be only|two issue leave for in this war first in the face of a massive invasion do stand by jeopardize the life of americans and leave to a long night of terror this will not happen shall do whatever be require to safeguard american life and american honor second in the face of complete intransigence at the conference table do join with enemy to install a communist government in south|vietnam this too will not happen will not cross the line from generosity to treachery now have a clear hard choice among course of action immediate withdrawal of all american force continue attempt at negotiation or decisive military action to end the war know that many americans favor the first course of action immediate withdrawal believe the way to end the war be for the|united|state to get out and to remove the threat to remain force by simply withdraw from a political standpoint this would be a very easy choice for to accept after all do not send over half|million americans to vietnam have bring man home from vietnam since take office but abandon commitment in vietnam here and now would mean turn south|vietnamese over to communist tyranny and terror would mean leave hundred of american prisoner in communist hand with no bargaining leverage to get release an american defeat in vietnam would encourage this kind of aggression all over the world aggression in which small nation arm by major ally could be tempt to attack neighboring nation at will in the mideast in europe and other area world peace would be in grave jeopardy the second course of action be to keep on try to negotiate a settlement now this be the course have prefer from the beginning and shall continue to pursue want to negotiate but have make every reasonable offer and try every possible path for end this war at the conference table the problem be as all know take to negotiate and now as throughout the|past|four|years the north|vietnamese arrogantly refuse to negotiate anything but an imposition an ultimatum that the|united|state impose a communist regime on people in south|vietnam who do not want a communist government be plain then that what appear to be a choice among course of action for the|united|state be really no choice at all the killing in this tragic war must stop by simply get out would only worsen the bloodshed by rely solely on negotiation would give an intransigent enemy the time need to press aggression on the battlefield there be only|one way to stop the killing that be to keep the weapon of war out of the hand of the international outlaw of north|vietnam throughout the war in vietnam the|united|state have exercise a degree of restraint unprecedented in the annal of war that be responsibility as a great nation a nation which be interested and can be proud of this as americans â€” as america have always be in peace not conquest however when the enemy abandon all restraint throw whole army into battle in the territory of neighbor refuse to negotiate simply face a new situation in these circumstance with americans threaten any president who fail to act

north|vietnamese naval operation from these port united|stat force have be direct to take appropriate measure within the internal and claim territorial water of north|vietnam to interdict the delivery

there must be an internationally supervise cease fire throughout indochina once prisoner of war be release once the internationally supervise cease fire have begin will stop all act of force throughout indochina and at that time will proceed with a complete withdrawal of all american force from vietnam within four|month now these term be generous term be term which would not require surrender and humiliation on the part of anybody would permit the|united|state to withdraw with honor would end the killing would bring pow 's home would allow negotiation on a political settlement between the vietnamese would permit all the nation which have suffer in this long war cambodia laos north|vietnam south|vietnam to turn at last to the urgent work of healing and of peace deserve immediate acceptance by north|vietnam be appropriate to conclude remark tonight with some comment direct individually to each of the major party involve in the continue tragedy of the vietnam war

stand together in purpose and resolve as so often in the past americans do not choose to resort to war have be force upon by an enemy that have show utter contempt toward every overture have make for peace and that be why fellow americans tonight ask for support of this decision a decision which have only|one purpose not to expand the war not to escalate the war but to end this war and to win the kind of peace that will last with god 's help with support will accomplish that great goal thank and good night view transcript transcript good evening have ask for this television time tonight to make public a plan for peace that can end the war in vietnam the offer that shall now present on behalf of the|government|of|the|united|state and the|government|of|south|vietnam with the full knowledge and approval of president thieu be both generous and far reach be a plan to end the war now include an offer to withdraw all american force within of an agreement acceptance would mean the speedy return of all the prisoner of war to home three|years|ago when take office there be americans in vietnam the number kill in action be run as|high|as|300 a week there be no plan to bring any americans home and the only thing that have be settle in paris be the shape of the conference table immediately move to fulfill a pledge have make to the american people to bring about a peace that could last not only for the|united|state but for the long suffer people of southeast|asia there be honorable path open to the path of negotiation be and be the path prefer but take to negotiate there have to be another way in case the other side refuse to negotiate that path call vietnamization what mean be train and equip the|south|vietnamese to defend and steadily withdraw americans as develop the capability to do so the path of vietnamization have be successful two|weeks|ago will recall announce that by may|1 american force in vietnam would be down to that mean almost|one half|million americans will have be bring home from vietnam over the|past|3|years in term of american life the loss of a week have be reduce by over|95|percent to less|than|10 a week but the path of vietnamization have be the long voyage home have strain the patience and test the perseverance of the american people what of the shortcut the shortcut prefer the path of negotiation progress here have be disappointing the american people deserve an accounting of why have be disappointing tonight intend to give that accounting and in so do be go to try to break the deadlock in the negotiation have make a series of public proposal design to bring an end to the conflict but early in this administration after of no progress in the public paris talk become convinced that be necessary to explore the possibility of negotiate in private channel to see whether would be possible to end the public deadlock after consultation with secretary of state|rogers ambassador in saigon and chief negotiator in paris and with the full knowledge and approval of president thieu send dr. kissinger to paris as personal representative on august|4,|1969 to begin these secret peace negotiation since that time dr. kissinger have travel to paris time on these secret mission have meet time with le|duc|tho of hanoi 's top political leader and minister xuan|thuy head of the north|vietnamese delegation to the paris talk and have meet with minister xuan|thuy time alone would like incidentally to take this opportunity to thank president pompidou of france for personal assistance in help to make the arrangement for these secret talk this be why initiate these private negotiation privately both side can be more flexible in offer new approach and also private discussion allow both side to talk frankly to take position free from the pressure of public debate in seek peace in vietnam with so many life at stake feel could not afford to let any opportunity go by private or public to negotiate a settlement as have state on a number of occasion be prepared and remain prepared to explore any avenue public or private to speed negotiation to end the war for 30|month whenever secretary rogers dr. kissinger or be ask about secret negotiation would only say be pursue every possible channel in search for peace there be never a leak because be determine not to jeopardize the secret negotiation until recently this course show sign of yield some progress now however be judgment that the purpose of peace will best be serve by bring out publicly the proposal have be make in private nothing be serve by silence when the other side exploit good faith to divide america and to avoid the conference table nothing be serve by silence when mislead some americans into accuse own government of fail to do what have already do nothing be serve by silence when enable the other side to imply possible solution publicly that have already flatly reject privately the time have come to lay the record of secret negotiation on the table just as secret negotiation can sometimes break a public deadlock public disclosure may help to break a secret deadlock some americans who believe what the north|vietnamese lead to believe have charge that the|united|states have not pursue negotiation intensively as the record that now will disclose will show just the opposite be true question have be raise as to why have not propose a deadline for the withdrawal of all american force in exchange for a cease fire and the return of prisoner of war why have not discuss the point proposal make by the vietcong last|july in paris why have not submit a new plan of own to move the negotiation off dead center as the private record will show have take all these step and more and have be flatly reject or ignore by the other side on may|31,|1971 at of the secret meeting in paris offer specifically to agree to a deadline for the withdrawal of all american force in exchange for the release of all prisoner of war and a cease fire at the next private meeting on june|26 the north|vietnamese reject offer privately propose instead own point plan which insist that overthrow the|government|of|south|vietnam five|days|later on july|1 the enemy publicly present a different package of proposal the point vietcong plan that pose a dilemma which package should respond to the public plan or the secret plan on july|12 at another private meeting in paris dr. kissinger put that question to the north|vietnamese directly say should deal with point secret plan because cover all of indochina include laos and cambodia while the vietcong point proposal be limit to vietnam so that be what do but go even beyond that deal with some of the point in the public plan that be not cover in the secret plan on august|16 at another private meeting go further offer the complete withdrawal of u.s. and ally force within after an agreement on an overall settlement on september|13 the north|vietnamese reject that proposal continue to insist that overthrow the|south|vietnamese|government now what have be the result of these private effort for month the north|vietnamese have be berate at the public session for not respond to side 's publicly present point plan the truth be that do respond to the enemy 's plan in the manner want to respond â€” secretly in full possession of complete response the north|vietnamese publicly denounce for not have respond at all induce many americans in the press and the congress into echo propaganda americans who could not know be be falsely use by the enemy to stir up divisiveness in this country decide in october that should make another attempt to break the deadlock consult with president thieu who concur fully in a new plan on october|11 send a private communication to the north|vietnamese that contain new element that could move negotiation forward urge a meeting on november|1 between dr. kissinger and special adviser le due tho or some other appropriate official from hanoi on october|25 the north|vietnamese agree to meet and suggest november|20 as the time for a meeting on november|17 just three|day before the schedule meeting say le|duc|tho be ill offer to meet as soon as recover either with or immediately with any other authorized leader who could come from hanoi two|month have pass since call off that meeting the only reply

matter stand today be be ask publicly to respond to proposal that answer and in some respect accept months|ago in private be be ask publicly to set a terminal date for withdrawal when already offer in private and the most comprehensive peace plan of this conflict lie ignore in a secret channel while the enemy try again for military victory that be why have instruct ambassador porter to present plan publicly at this thursday 's session of the paris peace talk along with alternative to make even more flexible be publish the full detail of plan tonight will prove beyond doubt which side have make every effort to make these negotiation succeed will show unmistakably that hanoi not washington or saigon â€” have make the war go on here be the essence of peace plan public disclosure may gain the attention deserve in hanoi within six|month of an agreement â€”we shall withdraw all u.s. and ally force from south|vietnam â€”we shall exchange all prisoner of war â€”there shall be a cease fire

which be proud to be a part be now before hold precious time in which to accomplish good for the nation must not waste know the political pressure in this session of the congress will be great there be more candidate for the presidency in this chamber today than there probably have be at any time in the whole history of the republic and there be an honest difference of opinion not only between the party but within each party on some foreign policy issue and on some domestic policy issue however there be great national problem that be so vital that transcend partisanship so let have debate let have honest difference but let join in keep the national interest first let join in make sure that legislation the nation need do not become hostage to the political interest of any party or any person there be ample precedent in this|election|year for to present with a huge list of new proposal know full well that there would not be any possibility of pass if work night and day shall not do that have present to the leader of the congress today a message of word discuss in some detail where the nation stand and set forth specific legislative item on which have ask the congress to act much

all the nation have make significant progress in these|first|year of the ' 70 city be no longer engulf by civil disorder college and university have again become place of learn instead of battleground a beginning have be make in preserve and protect environment the rate of increase in crime have be slow and here in the city where the federal government have direct jurisdiction serious crime in be actually reduce by from most important because of the beginning that have be make can say today that this|year|1972 can be the|year in which america may make the great progress in toward achieve goal of be at peace with all the nation of the world as involvement in the war in vietnam come to an end must now go on to build a generation of peace to achieve that goal must first face realistically the need to maintain defense in have reduce the burden of arm for the first time in spend on defense have be bring below spending on human resource as look to the future find encouraging progress in negotiation with the|soviet|union on limitation of strategic arm and look further into the future hope there can eventually be agreement on the mutual reduction of arm but until there be such a mutual agreement must maintain the strength necessary to deter war and that be why because of rise research and development cost because of increase in military and civilian pay because of the need to proceed with new weapon system budget for will provide for an increase in defense spending strong military defense be not the enemy of peace be the guardian of peace there could be no more misguided set of priority than which would tempt other by weaken america and thereby endanger the peace of the world in foreign policy have enter a new era the world have change greatly in the|11|years since

compromise local school board must have control over local school as look ahead over the|coming|decades vast new growth and change be not only certainty will be the dominant reality of this world and particularly of life in america survey the certainty of rapid change can be like a fallen rider catch in the stirrup can sit high in the saddle the master of change direct on a course choose the secret of master change in today 's world be to reach back to old and prove principle and to adapt with imagination and intelligence to the new reality of a new age that be what have do in the proposal that have lay before the congress be root in basic principle that be as endure as human nature as robust as the american experience and be responsive to new condition thus represent a spirit of change that be truly renewal as look back at those old principle find as timely as be timeless believe in independence and self reliance and the creative value of the competitive spirit believe in

so with the full understanding that what seek in the|seventie what quest be be not merely for more but for well for a well quality of life for all americans thus for example be give a new measure of attention to clean up air and water make surrounding more attractive be provide broad support for the art help stimulate a deep appreciation of what can contribute to the nation 's activity and to individual life but nothing really matter more to the quality of life than the way treat one another than capacity to live respectfully together as a unified society with a full generous regard for

doubt and self criticism but these be only the other side of grow sensitivity to the persistence of want in the midst of plenty of impatience with the slowness with which age old ill be be overcome if be indifferent to the shortcoming of society or complacent about institution or blind to the linger inequity then would have lose way but the fact that have those concern be evidence that ideal deep down be still strong indeed remind that what be really good about america be compassion remind that in the final analysis america be great not because be strong not because be rich but because this be a good country let reject the narrow vision of those who would tell that be evil because be not yet perfect that be corrupt because be not yet pure that all the sweat and toil and sacrifice that have go into the building of america be for naught because the building be not yet do let see that the path be travel be wide with room in for all of and that direction be toward a well nation and a more peaceful world never have matter more that go forward together look at this chamber the leadership of america be here today the|supreme|court the cabinet the senate the|house|of|representatives

concrete agreement this statement that have just read express the commitment of the soviet and american|government at the high level to achieve that goal if succeed this joint statement that have be issue today may well be remember as the beginning of a new era in which all nation will devote more of energy and resource not to the weapon of war but to the work of peace view transcript transcript good evening fellow americans over the|past|several|weeks have hear a number of report on tv radio and in newspaper on the situation in southeast|asia think the time have come for as president and as commander in chief of armed|force to put these report in perspective to lay all the pertinent fact before and to let judge for yourself as to the success or failure of policy be glad to be able to begin report tonight by announce that have decide to increase the rate of american troop withdrawal for the period from may|1|to|december|1 before go into detail would like to review briefly what find when come into office the progress have make to date in reduce american force and the reason why be able to announce a step up withdrawal without jeopardize remain force in vietnam and without endanger ultimate goal of end american involvement in a way which will increase the chance for a last peace in the pacific and in the world when leave washington in january|of|1961 after serve eight|year as vice president under president eisenhower there be no american combat force in vietnam no americans have die in combat in vietnam when return to washington as president eight|years|later there be american troop in vietnam one|thousand have die there three|hundred americans be be lose every week and there be no comprehensive plan to end involvement in the war implement a plan to train and equip the|south|vietnamese to withdraw american force and to end american involvement in the war just as soon as the south|vietnamese have develop the capacity to defend country against communist aggression on this chart on right can see how plan have succeed in june|of|1969 announce a withdrawal of man in september december april|of|1970 by the|first|of|next|month may|1 will have bring home more|than|265,000 americans â€” almost|half of the troop in vietnam when take office now another indication of the progress have make be in reduce american casualty casualty be time as great in the|first|3|months|of|1969 as be in the|first|three|months|this|year south|vietnamese casualty have also drop significantly in the|past|two|year american die in combat be too many but goal be no american fighting man die anyplace in the world every decision have make in the past and every decision make in the future will have the purpose of achieve that goal let review now decision have make which have contribute to the achievement of goal in vietnam that have see on this chart the first be the destruction of enemy basis in cambodia will recall that at the time of that decision many express fear that have widen the war that casualty would increase that troop withdrawal program would be delay now do not question the sincerity of those who express these fear but can see now be wrong american troop be out of cambodia in just as pledge would be american casualty do not rise be cut in half american troop withdrawal be not halt or delay continue at an accelerated pace now let turn to the laotian operation as know this be undertake by south|vietnamese ground force with american air support against north|vietnamese troop which have be use laotian territory for six|year to attack american force and ally force in south|vietnam since the completion of that operation there have be a great deal of understandable speculation just as there be after cambodia whether or not be a success or a failure a victory or a defeat but as in cambodia what be important be not the instant analysis of the moment but what happen in the future do the laotian operation contribute to the goal seek have just complete assessment of that operation and here be conclusion first the south|vietnamese demonstrate that without american adviser could fight effectively against the very good troop north|vietnam could put in the field second the south|vietnamese suffer heavy casualty but by every conservative estimate the casualty suffer by the enemy be far heavy third and most important the disruption of enemy supply line the consumption of ammunition and arm in the battle have be even more damaging to the capability of the north|vietnamese to sustain major offensive in south|vietnam than be the operation in cambodia consequently tonight can report that vietnamization have succeed because of the increase strength of the|south|vietnamese because of the success of the cambodian operation because of the achievement of the south|vietnamese operation in laos be announce an increase in the rate of american withdrawal between|may|1|and|december|1|of|this|year more american troop will be bring home from south|vietnam this will bring the total number of american troop withdraw from south|vietnam to now that be over|two third of the number who be there when come into office as can see from this chart on left the government of south vietnam fully support the decision have just announce now let look at the future as can see from the progress have make to date and by this announcement tonight the american involvement in vietnam be come to an end the day the south|vietnamese can take over own defense be in sight goal be a total american withdrawal from vietnam can and will reach that goal through program of vietnamization if necessary but would infinitely prefer to reach even sooner â€” through negotiation be sure most of will recall that on october|7|of|last|year in a national tv broadcast propose an immediate cease fire throughout indochina the immediate release of all prisoner of war in the indochina area an all indochina peace conference the complete withdrawal of all outside force and a political settlement tonight again call on hanoi to engage in serious negotiation to speed the end of this war especially call on hanoi to agree to the immediate and unconditional release of all prisoner of war throughout indochina be time for hanoi to end the barbaric use of prisoner as negotiate pawn and to join in a humane act that will free man as well as ours let turn now to a proposal which at first glance have a great deal of popular appeal if goal be a total withdrawal of all force why do not announce a date now for end involvement well the difficulty in make such an announcement to the american people be that would also be make that announcement to the enemy and would serve the enemy 's purpose and not own if the|united|states should announce that will quit regardless of what the enemy do would have throw away principal bargaining counter to win the release of american prisoner of war would remove the enemy 's strong incentive to end the war sooner by negotiation and will have give enemy commander the exact information need to marshal attack against remain force at most vulnerable time the issue very simply be this shall leave vietnam in a way that by own action consciously turn the country over to the communists or shall leave in a way that give the south|vietnamese a reasonable chance to survive as a free people plan will end american involvement in a way that would provide that chance and the other plan would end precipitately and give victory to the communists in a deep sense have the choice of end involvement in this war on a note of despair or on a note of hope believe as thomas|jefferson do that americans will always choose hope over despair have in power to leave vietnam in a way that offer a brave people a realistic hope of freedom have in power to prove to friend in the world that america 's sense of responsibility remain the world 's great single hope of peace and above all have in power to close a difficult chapter in american history not meanly but nobly â€” so that each of can come out of this searing experience with a measure of pride in nation confidence in own character and hope for the future of the spirit of america know there be those who honestly believe that should move to end this war without regard to what happen to south|vietnam this way would abandon friend but even more important would abandon would plunge from the anguish of war into a nightmare of recrimination would lose respect for this nation respect for another respect for understand the deep concern which have be raise in this country fan by report of brutality in vietnam let put this into perspective have visit vietnam many time and speak now from that experience and as commander in chief of armed|force feel be duty to speak up for the|two|and|a|half|million fine young americans who have serve in vietnam the atrocity charge in individual case should not and can not be allow to reflect on courage and self sacrifice war be a terrible and cruel experience for a nation and be particularly terrible and cruel for those who bear the burden of fighting but never in history have man fight for less selfish motif not for conquest not for glory but only for the right of a people far away to choose the kind of government want while hear and read much of isolated act of cruelty do not hear enough of of individual american soldier have see there building school road hospital clinic who through countless act of generosity and kindness have try to help the people of south|vietnam can and should be very proud of these man deserve not scorn but deserve admiration and deep appreciation the way to express that appreciation be to end america 's participation in this conflict not in failure or in defeat but in achievement of the great goal for which fight a south|vietnam free to determine own future and an america no longer divide by war but unite in peace that be why be so important how end this war by decision will demonstrate the kind of people be and the kind of country will become that be why have charter the course have lay out tonight to end this war but end in a way that will strengthen trust for america around the world not undermine in a way that will redeem the sacrifice that have be make not insult in a way that will heal this nation not tear apart can assure tonight with confidence that american involvement in this war be come to an end but can believe this understand why this question be raise by many very honest and sincere people because many time in the past in this long and difficult war action have be announce from washington which be suppose to lead to a reduction of american involvement in vietnam and over and over these action result in more americans go to vietnam and more casualty in vietnam tonight do not ask to take what say on faith look at the record look again at this chart on left every action take by this administration every decision make have accomplish what say would accomplish have reduce american involvement have drastically reduce casualty in campaign for the presidency pledge to end american involvement in this war be keep that pledge and expect to be hold accountable by the american people if fail be often ask what would like to accomplish more than anything else while serve as president of the|united|state and always give the same answer to bring peace â€” peace abroad peace at home for america the reason be so deeply committed to peace go far beyond political consideration or concern about place in history or the other reason that political scientist usually say be the motivation of president every time talk to a brave wife of an american pow every time write a letter to the mother of a boy who have be kill in vietnam become more deeply committed to end this war and to end in a way that can build last peace think the hard thing that a president have to do be to present posthumously the nation 's high honor the|medal|of|honor to mother or father or widow of man who have lose life but in the process have save the life of other have an award ceremony in of the|white|house just a|few|weeks|ago and at that ceremony remember of the recipient mrs. karl|taylor from pennsylvania husband be a marine sergeant sergeant karl|taylor charge an enemy machine gun single handed and knock out lose life but in the process the life of several wound marines in the range of that machine gun be save after present the medal shake hand with child karl jr.â€”he be and kevin who be as be about to move to the next recipient kevin suddenly stand at attention and salute find rather difficult to get thought together for the next presentation fellow americans want to end this war in a way that be worthy of the sacrifice of karl|taylor and think would want to end in a way that would increase the chance that kevin and karl and all those child like here and around the world could grow up in a world where none of would have to die in war that would increase the chance for america to have what have not have in this century a full generation of peace have come a long way in the|last|two|year toward that goal with continued support believe will achieve that goal and generation in the future will look back at this difficult try time in america 's history and will be proud that demonstrate that have the courage and the character of a great people thank view transcript transcript good morning fellow americans over the|past|ten|year president of the|united|state have come before the american people in time of crisis to talk about war or the threat of war today be able to talk to in a more hopeful and positive vein about how be move this nation and the world toward a last peace have bring to a time of transition from war toward peace and this be a good time to gain some perspective on where be and where be head today be send to the congress second annual comprehensive report on the conduct of foreign affair discuss not only what have do but why have do and how intend to proceed in the future do not intend to summarize all that be in detailed report on foreign policy at this time instead would like to focus on key point â€”how be get out of the war this nation have be in for the|past|six|year â€”how have create a new and different foreign policy approach for the|united|state in a greatly change world and â€”how be apply that approach in work with other to build a lasting peace the most immediate and anguish problem that face this administration two|years|ago be the war in vietnam have come a long way since then two|years|ago when this administration take office there be almost|550,000 americans in vietnam within will have bring home man and this spring will announce a new schedule of withdrawal two|years|ago casualty each|month be time as high as be today two|years|ago the additional demand of the vietnam war cost approximately|$22|billion per year that cost have be cut in half much of the progress in vietnam be due to the success of the allied operation against the enemy sanctuary in cambodia last|spring the clear proof be in this figure american casualty after cambodia have be half the rate be before cambodia decision to clean out the sanctuary in cambodia save thousand of american life and enable to continue withdraw man on schedule just|as|last|year 's cutoff of supply through cambodia have save life and insure withdrawal program this|year the purpose of this year 's disruption of the|ho|chi|minh|trail in laos be to save life and insure the success of withdrawal program next|year the disruption of the communist supply line through laos be be accomplish by south|vietnamese troop with no u.s. ground troop or adviser army be do the fighting with air support and the intensity of the fighting be evidence of the importance of that supply line to the enemy consider this combination of event that many people think be impossible only|two|years|ago have keep commitment as have take out troop south|vietnam now have an excellent opportunity not only to survive but to build a strong free society thank to the disruption of so much of the enemy 's supply americans be leave south|vietnam in safety would much prefer to leave south|vietnam in peace negotiation remain the good and quick way to end the war in a way that will not only end u.s. involvement and casualty but will mean an end to the fighting between north and south|vietnamese on october|7 make a proposal that could open the door to that kind of peace propose â€”an immediate standstill cease fire throughout indochina to stop the fighting â€”an indochina peace conference â€”the withdrawal of all outside force political settlement fair to both side â€”the immediate release of all prisoner of war reaffirm that proposal today be support by every government in indochina except the government of north vietnam once again urge hanoi to join in this search for peace if north|vietnam wish to negotiate with the|united|state will have to recognize that time be run out with the exception of the prisoner of war issue if north|vietnam continue to refuse to discuss peace proposal will soon find have no choice but to negotiate only with the|south|vietnamese eventual goal be a total withdrawal of all outside force but as long as north|vietnam continue to hold a single american prisoner shall have force in south|vietnam the american prisoner of war will not be forget by government be keep pledge to end america 's involvement in this war but the main point want to discuss with today and the main theme of report to the congress â€” be the future not the past matter very much how end this war to end a war be simple but to end a war in a way that will not bring on another war be far from simple in southeast|asia today aggression be fail thank to the determination of the south|vietnamese people and to the courage and sacrifice of america 's fighting man that bring to a point that have be at several time before in this|century aggression train back a war end be at a critical moment in history what america do â€” or fail to do will determine whether peace and freedom can be win in the come generation that be why the way in which end this conflict be so crucial to effort to build a lasting peace in coming|decade the right way out of vietnam be crucial to change role in the world and to peace in the world to understand the nature of the new american role must consider the great historical change that have take place for after world|war|ii the|united|states be not only the leader of the non - communist world be the primary supporter and defender of this free world as well today ally and friend have gain new strength and self confidence be now able to participate much more fully not only in own defense but in add moral and spiritual strength to the creation of a stable world order â€”today adversary no longer present a solidly united front can now differentiate in dealing with â€”today neither the|united|state nor the|soviet|union have a clear cut nuclear advantage the time be therefore ripe to come to an agreement on the control of arm the world have change foreign policy must change with have learn in recent|years the danger of over involvement the other danger a grave risk be equally determined to avoid be under involvement after a long and unpopular war there be temptation to turn inward to withdraw from the world to back away from commitment that deceptively smooth road of the new isolationism be surely the road to war foreign policy today steer a steady course between the past danger of over involvement and the new temptation of under involvement that policy which first enunciate in guam represent basic approach to the world will maintain commitment but will make sure own troop level or any financial support to other nation be appropriate to current threat and need shall provide a shield if a nuclear power threaten the freedom of a nation ally with or of a nation whose survival consider vital to security but will look to threaten country and neighbor to assume primary responsibility for own defense and will provide support where interest call for that support and where can make a difference these principle be not limit to security matter shall pursue economic policy at home and abroad that encourage trade wherever possible and that strengthen political tie between nation as actively seek to help other nation expand economy can legitimately expect to work with in avert economic problem of own as continue to send economic aid to develop nation will expect country on the receiving end to mobilize resource will look to other developed nation to do more in furnish assistance and will channel aid increasingly through group of nation band together for mutual support this new sharing of responsibility require not less american leadership than in the past but rather a new more subtle form of leadership no single nation can build a peace alone peace can only be build by the willing hand and mind of all in the modern world leadership can not be do yourself"â€”the path of leadership be in provide the help the motive the inspiration to do together in carry out what be refer to as the|nixon|doctrine recognize that can not transfer burden too swiftly must strike a balance between do too much and prevent self reliance and suddenly do too little and undermine self confidence intend to give friend the time and the mean to adjust materially and psychologically to a new form of american participation in the world how have apply new foreign policy during the|past|year and what be future agenda as work with other to build a stable world order in western|europe have shift from predominance to partnership with ally tie with western|europe be central to the structure of peace because nation be rich in tradition and experience strong economically vigorous in diplomacy and culture be in a position to take a major part in build a world of peace tie be strengthen on second trip to europe this|summer and reflect in close consultation on arm control negotiation at suggestion the nato alliance make a thorough review of military strategy and posture as a result have reach new agreement on a strong defense and the need to share the burden more fairly in exchange of state visit with romania and meeting last|fall with marshal|tito in yugoslavia be example of search for wide reconciliation with the nation that use to be consider behind an iron curtain look ahead in europe â€”we shall cooperate in political and economic relation across the atlantic as the common market grow â€”we and ally will make the improvement necessary to carry out common defense strategy â€”together stand ready to reduce force in western|europe in exchange for mutual reduction in the problem of africa be great but so be potential the|united|state will support people ' effort to build a continent that provide social justice and economic expansion turn to own hemisphere in latin|america there be too much tendency in the past to take close friend and neighbor for grant recently have pay new respect to proud tradition trade credit and economic policy have be reexamine and reform to respond to concern and idea as well as to own interest new latin|american policy be design to help help new attitude will not only aid progress but add to dignity great change be brew throughout the american hemisphere can have no great goal than to help provide the mean for necessary change to be accomplish in peace and for all change to be in the direction of great self reliance turn to the|far|east a new asia be emerge the old enmity of world|war|ii be dead or die asian state be strong and be join together in vigorous regional grouping here the doctrine that take shape last|year be take hold today help to spur self reliance and cooperation between state in japan south|korea thailand and the philippines have consolidate basis and reduce american force have relaxed trade and travel restriction to underline readiness for great contact with communist china look ahead in that area â€”while continue to help friend help must begin to consider how regional association can work together with the major power in the area for a durable peace â€”we will work to build a strong partnership with japan that will accommodate mutual interest â€”we will search for consecutive discussion with communist china while maintain defense commitment to taiwan when the government of the people 's republic of china be ready to engage in talk will find receptive to agreement that further the legitimate national interest of china and neighbor in asia can see tomorrow 's world in microcosm an economically powerful democratic free nation japan be seek new market a potentially powerful communist nation china will one|day seek new outlet and new relation a communist competitor the|soviet|union have interest there as well and the independent non - communist nation of southeast|asia be already work together in regional association these great force be bind to interact in the not too distant future in the way work together and in the way cooperate with relationship be the key to permanent peace in that area the|far|east the scene of such a painful legacy of the recent past can become an example of peace and stability in the future in the|middle|east the|united|state take the initiative to stop the fighting and start the process of peace along the|suez|canal a|year|ago there be daily combat on the ground and in the air diplomacy be at an impasse the danger of local conflict be magnify by grow soviet involvement and the possibility of great power be draw into confrontation america take the lead in arrange a cease fire and get negotiation start be see to that the balance of power so necessary to discourage a new outbreak of fighting be not upset work behind the scene when a crisis arise in jordan the|united|state play a key role in see that order be restore and an invasion be abandon recognize that century of suspicion and decade of hostility can not be end overnight there be great obstacle in the way of a permanent peaceful settlement and painful compromise be require by all concern be encourage by the willingness of each of the party to begin to look to the large interest of peace and stability throughout the|middle|east there be still the risk of war but now for the first time in year the party be actively calculate the risk of peace the policy of the|united|state will continue to be to promote peace talk not to try to impose a peace from the outside but to support the peace effort of the party in the region way to support these effort be for the|united|state to discourage any outside power from try to exploit the situation for own advantage another way for to help turn a tenuous truce into a permanent settlement be this the|united|states be fully prepared to play a responsible and cooperative role in keep the peace arrive at through negotiation between the party know what vital interest be in the|middle|east those interest include friendly and constructive relation with all nation in the area other nation know that be ready to protect those vital interest and good reason why other nation take at word in the|middle|east be because the|united|state have keep word in southeast|asia now come to a matter that affect every nation the relation between the world 's great super power over the|past|years in some field the|soviet|union and the|united|state have move ahead together have take the first step toward cooperation in outer space have both ratify the treaty limit the spread of nuclear weapon sign a treaty to prohibit nuclear weapon from the seabed these be hopeful sign but certain other soviet action be reason for concern there be need for much more cooperation in reduce tension in the|middle|east and in end harassment of berlin must also discourage the temptation to raise new challenge in sensitive area such as the caribbean in the long run the most significant result of negotiation between the super power in the|past|year could be in the field of arm control the strategic arm limitation talk with the|soviet|union have produce the most searching examination of the nature of strategic competition ever conduct between nation each side have have the chance to explain at length the concern cause by the posture of the other side the talk have be conduct in a serious way without the old lapse into propaganda if both side continue in this way there be reason to hope that specific agreement will be reach to curb the arm race take a first step in limit the capacity of mankind to destroy would mark a turning point in the history of the postwar world would add to the security of both the|soviet|union and the|united|state and would add to the world 's peace of mind in all relation with the soviets shall make the most progress by recognize that in many case national interest be not the same serve no purpose to pretend be difference be not matter of mood be matter of substance but in many other case separate national interest can best be pursue by a sober consideration of the world interest the|united|state will deal as must from strength will not reduce defense below the level consider essential to national security a strong america be essential to the cause of peace today until have the kind of agreement can rely on shall remain strong but america 's power will always be use for build a peace never for break â€” only for defend freedom never for destroy america 's strength will be as must be second to none but the strength that this nation be proud of be the strength of determination to create a peaceful world all know how every town or city develop a sense of community when citizen come together to meet a common need the common need of the world today about which there can be no disagreement or conflict of national interest be plain to see know that must act as world in restore the world 's environment before pollution of the sea and sky overwhelm every nation know must stop the flow of narcotic must counter the outbreak of hijacking and kidnaping must share the great discovery about the ocean and outer space the|united|state be justly proud of the lead have take in work within the|united|nation and within the nato alliance to come to grip with these problem and with these opportunity work here be a beginning not only in cop with the new challenge of technology and modern life but of develop a worldwide sense of community that will ease tension reduce suspicion and thereby promote the process of peace that process can only flourish in a climate of mutual respect can have that mutual respect with friend without dominate or without let down can have that mutual respect with adversary without compromise principle or weaken resolve and can have that mutual respect among without stifle dissent or lose capacity for action goal be something americans have not enjoy in this|century a full generation of peace a full generation of peace depend not only on the policy of party or of nation or alliance or bloc of nation peace for the next generation depend on ability to make certain that each nation have a share in shaping and that every nation have a stake in lasting this be the hard way require patience restraint understanding and â€” when necessary bold decisive action but history have teach that the old diplomacy of impose a peace by the fiat of great power simply do not work believe that the new diplomacy of partnership of mutual respect of deal with strength and determination will work believe that the right degree of american involvement â€” not too much and not too little â€” will evoke the right response from other partner on this globe in building for child the kind of world deserve a world of opportunity in a world without war view transcript transcript mr. speaker mr. president colleague in the congress distinguished

campaign to find a cure for cancer and will ask later for whatever additional fund can effectively be use the time have come in america when the same kind of concentrated effort that split the atom and take man to the moon should be turn toward conquer this dread disease let make a total national commitment to achieve this goal america have long be the wealthy nation in the world now be time become the healthy nation in the world the fifth great goal be to strengthen and to renew state and local government as approach 200th anniversary in remember that this nation launch as a loose confederation of separate state without a workable central government at that time the mark of leader ' vision be that quickly see the need to balance the separate power of the state with a government of central power and so give a constitution of balanced power of unity with diversity and so clear be vision that survive today as the old write constitution still in force in the world for almost century since and dramatically in the at those great turning point when the question have be between the state and the federal government that question have be resolve in favor of a strong central federal government during this time the nation grow and the nation prosper but thing history tell be that no great movement go in the same direction forever nation change adapt or slowly die the time have now come in america to reverse the flow of power and resource from the state and community to washington and start power and resource flow back from washington to the state and community and more important to the people all across america the time have come for a new partnership between the federal government and the state and locality a partnership in which entrust the state and locality with a large share of the nation 's responsibility and in which share federal revenue with so that can meet those responsibility to achieve this goal propose to the congress tonight that enact a plan of revenue sharing historic in scope and bold in concept all across america today state and city be confront with a financial crisis some have already be cut back on essential service for example just recently and cleveland cut back on trash collection most be catch between the prospect of bankruptcy on the hand and add to an already crush tax burden on the other as indication of the rise cost of local government discover the other day that home town of whittier california â€” which have a population of a large budget for than the entire federal budget be in now the time have come to take a new direction and once again to introduce a new and more creative balance to approach to government so let put the money where the need be and let put the power to spend where the people be propose that the congress make a investment in renew state and local government five|billion|dollar of this will be in new and unrestricted fund to be use as the state and locality see fit the other will be provide by allocate of new fund and convert third of the money go to the present narrow purpose aid program into federal revenue sharing fund for broad purpose for urban development rural development education transportation job training and law enforcement but with the state and localite make own decision on how should be spend within each category for the|next|fiscal|year this would increase total federal aid to the state and locality more|than|25|percent over the present level the revenue sharing proposal send to the congress will include the safeguard against discrimination that accompany all other federal fund allocate to the state neither the president nor the congress nor the conscience of this nation can permit money which come from all the people to be use in a way which discriminate against some of the people the federal government will still have a large and vital role to play in achieve national progress establish function that be clearly and essentially federal in nature will still be perform by the federal government new function that need to be sponsor or perform by the federal government such as those have urge tonight in welfare and health will be add to the federal agenda whenever make the good sense for to act as a whole nation the federal government should and will lead the way but where state or local government can better do what need to be do let see that have the resource to do there under this plan the federal government will provide the state and locality with more money and less interference and by cut down the interference the same amount of money will go a lot further let share resource let share to rescue the state and locality from the brink of financial crisis let share to give homeowner and wage earner a chance to escape from ever high property taxis and sale taxis let share resource for other reason as well the first of these reason have to do with government and the second have to do with each of with the individual let face most americans today be simply feed up with government at all level will not â€” and should not â€” continue to tolerate the gap between promise and performance in government the fact be that have make the federal government so strong grow muscle bind and the state and locality so weak approach impotence if put more power in more place can make government more creative in more place that way multiply the number of people with the ability to make thing happen and can open the way to a new burst of creative energy throughout america the final reason urge this historic shift be much more personal for each and for every of as everything seem to have grow big and more complex in america as the force that shape life seem to have grow more distant and more impersonal a great feeling of frustration have creep across this land whether be the workingman who feel neglect the black man who feel oppress or the mother concern about child there have be a grow feeling that thing be in the saddle and ride mankind million of frustrated young americans today be cry out ask not what will government do for but what can do how can contribute how can matter and so let answer let say to and let say to all americans hear will give a chance be go to give a new chance to have more to say about the decision that affect future a chance to participate in government because be go to provide more center of power where what do can make a difference that can see and feel in own life and the life of whole community the further away government be from people the strong government become and the weak people become and a nation with a strong government and a weak people be an empty shell reject the patronizing idea that government in washington d.c. be inevitably more wise more honest and more efficient than government at the local or state level the honesty and efficiency of government depend on people government at all level have good people and bad people and the way to get more good people into government be to give more opportunity to do good thing the idea that a bureaucratic elite in washington know good what be good for people everywhere and that can not trust local government be really a contention that can not trust people to govern this notion be completely foreign to the american experience local government be the government close to the people be most responsive to the individual person be people 's government in a far more intimate way than the government in washington can ever be people come to america because want to determine own future rather than to live in a country where other determine future for what this change mean be that once again in america be place trust in people have faith in people trust the judgment of people let give the people of america a chance a big voice in decide for those question that so greatly affect life the sixth great goal be a complete reform of the|federal|government base on a long and intensive study with the aid of the good advice obtainable have conclude that a sweeping reorganization of the executive branch be need if the government be to keep up with the time and with the need of the people propose therefore that reduce the present cabinet department to propose that the departments|of|state treasury defense and justice remain but that all the other department be consolidate into human|resource community|development natural|resources and economic|development let look at what these would be â€”first a department deal with the concern of people as individual as member of a family a department focus on human need â€”second a department concern with the community rural community and urban community and with all that take to make a community function as a community a department concern with physical environment with the preservation and balanced use of those great natural resource on which nation depend â€”and fourth a department concern with prosperity with job business and those many activity that keep economy run smoothly and well under this plan rather than divide up department by narrow subject would organize around the great purpose of government rather than scatter responsibility by add new level of bureaucracy would focus and concentrate the responsibility for get problem solve with these department when have a problem will know where to go â€” and the department will have the authority and the resource to do something about over the|year have add department and create agency at the federal level each to serve a new constituency to handle a particular task and these have grow and multiply in what have become a hopeless confusion of form and function the time have come to match structure to purpose to look with a fresh eye to organize the government by conscious comprehensive design to meet the new need of a new era one|hundred|years|ago abraham|lincoln stand on a battlefield and speak of a government of the people by the people for the people too often since then have become a nation of the government by the government for the government by enact these reform can renew that principle that lincoln state so simply and so well by give everyone 's voice a chance to be hear will have government that truly be of the people by create more center of meaningful power more place where decision that really count can be make by give more people a chance to do something can have government that truly be by the people and by set up a completely modern functional system of government at the national level in washington will at last be able to provide government that be truly for the people realize that what be ask be that not only the executive branch in washington but that even this congress will have to change by give up some of power change be hard but without change there can be no progress and for each of the question then become not will change cause inconvenience but will change bring progress for america give up power be hard but would urge all of as leader of this country to remember that the truly revere leader in world history be those who give power to people and not those who take away as consider these reform will be act not for the|next|two|year or for the|next|ten|year but for the|next|100|year so let approach these great goal with a sense not only of this moment in history but also of history let act with the willingness to work together and the vision and the boldness and the courage of those great americans who meet in philadelphia almost|190|years|ago to write a constitution let leave a heritage as do â€” not just for child but for million yet unborn â€” of a nation where every american will have a chance not only to live in peace and to enjoy prosperity and opportunity but to participate in a system of government where know not only vote but idea count a system of government which will provide the mean for america to reach height of achievement undreamed of before those man who meet at philadelphia leave a great heritage because have a vision â€” not only of what the nation be but of what could become as think of that vision recall that america be found as the land of the open door as a haven for the oppress a land of opportunity a place of refuge of hope when the first settler open the door of america three|and|a|half|centuries|ago come to escape persecution and to find opportunity and leave wide the door of welcome for other to follow when the colonies declare independence almost|two|centuries|ago open the door to a new vision of liberty and of human fulfillment not just for an elite but for all to the generation that follow america 's be the open door that beckon million from the old world to the new in search of a well life a free life a full life and in which by own decision could shape own destiny for the black american the indian the mexican american and for those other in land who have not have an equal chance the nation at last have begin to confront the need to press open the door of full and equal opportunity and of human dignity for all americans with these change have propose tonight can open the door to a new era of opportunity can open the door to full and effective participation in the decision that affect life can open the door to a new partnership among government at all level between those government and the people and by so do can open wide the door of human fulfillment for million of people here in america now and in the|year to come in the|next|few|week will spell out in great detail the way propose that achieve these great goal ask this congress to be responsive if be then the 92nd congress congress congress at the end of term will be able to look back on a record more splendid than any in history this can be the congress that help end the long war in the nation 's history and end in a way that will give at last a genuine chance to enjoy what have not have in this|century a full generation of peace this can be the congress that help achieve an expand economy with full employment and without inflation and without the deadly stimulus of war this can be the congress that reform

endure legacy of park for the people this can be the congress that launch a new era in american medicine in which the quality of medical care be enhance while the cost be make less burdensome but above all what this congress can be remember for be open the way to a new american revolution a peaceful revolution in which power be turn back to the people in which government at all level be refresh and renew and make truly responsive this can be a revolution as profound as far reach as exciting as that first revolution almost|200|years|ago and can mean that just|five|years from now america will enter its|third|century as a young nation new in spirit with all the vigor and the freshness with which begin its|first|century colleague in the congress these be great goal can make the session of this congress a great moment for america so let pledge together to go forward together by achieve these goal to give america the foundation today for a new greatness tomorrow and in all|the|year to come and in so do to make this the great congress in the history of this great and good country & nbsp view transcript transcript good evening fellow americans ten|days|ago in report to the nation on vietnam announce a decision to withdraw an|additional|150,000 americans from vietnam over the|next|year say then that be make that decision despite concern over increase enemy activity in laos in cambodia and in south|vietnam at that time warn that if conclude that increase enemy activity in any of these area endanger the five of americans remain in vietnam would not hesitate to take strong and effective measure to deal with that situation despite that warning north|vietnam have increase military aggression in all these area and particularly in cambodia after full consultation with the|national|security|council ambassador bunker general abrams and other adviser have conclude that the action of the enemy in the|last|10|day clearly endanger the life of americans who be in vietnam now and would constitute an unacceptable risk to those who will be there after withdrawal of another to protect man who be in vietnam and to guarantee the continued success of withdrawal and vietnamization program have conclude that the time have come for action tonight shall describe the action of the enemy the action have order to deal with that situation and the reason for decision cambodia a small country of people have be a neutral nation since the geneva agreement of agreement incidentally which be sign by the government|of|north|vietnam american policy since then have be to scrupulously respect the neutrality of the cambodian people have maintain a skeleton diplomatic mission of fewer|than|15 in cambodia 's capital and that only since last|august for the|previous|4|year do not have any diplomatic mission whatever in cambodia and for the|past|5|years have provide no military assistance whatever and no economic assistance to cambodia north|vietnam however have not respect that neutrality for the|past|5|year â€” as indicate on this map that see here north vietnam have occupy military sanctuary all along the cambodian frontier with south|vietnam some of these extend up|to|20|mile into cambodia the sanctuary be in red and as note be on both side of the border be use for hit and run attack on american and south|vietnamese force in south|vietnam these communist occupy territory contain major base camp training site logistic facility weapon and ammunition factory airstrip and prisoner of war compound for neither the|united|state nor south|vietnam have move against these enemy sanctuary because do not wish to violate the territory of a neutral nation even after the vietnamese communists begin to expand these sanctuary counsel patience to south|vietnamese ally and impose restraint on own commander in contrast to policy the enemy in the|past|two|week have step up guerrilla action and be concentrate main force in these sanctuary that see on this map where be build up to launch massive attack on force and those of south|vietnam north|vietnam in the|last|two|week have strip away all pretense of respect the sovereignty or the neutrality of cambodia thousand of soldier be invade the country from the sanctuary be encircle the capital of phnom|penh come from these sanctuary as see here have move into cambodia and be encircle the capital cambodia as a result of this have send out a call to the|united|state to a number of other nation for assistance because if this enemy effort succeed cambodia would become a vast enemy staging area and a springboard for attack on south|vietnam along of frontier a refuge where enemy troop could return from combat without fear of retaliation north|vietnamese man and supply could then be pour into that country jeopardize not only the life of own man but the people of south|vietnam as well now confront with this situation have option first can do nothing well the ultimate result of that course of action be clear unless indulge in wishful thinking the life of americans remain in vietnam after next withdrawal of would be gravely threaten let go to the map again here be south vietnam here be north|vietnam north|vietnam already occupy this part of laos if north|vietnam also occupy this whole band in cambodia or the entire country would mean that south|vietnam be completely outflanked and the force of americans in this area as well as the|south|vietnamese would be in an untenable military position second choice be to provide massive military assistance to cambodia now unfortunately while deeply sympathize with the plight of seven|million cambodians whose country be be invade massive amount of military assistance could not be rapidly and effectively utilize by the small cambodian|army against the immediate threat with other nation shall do good to provide the small arm and other equipment which the|cambodian|army of need and can use for defense but the aid will provide will be limit to the purpose of enable cambodia to defend neutrality and not for the purpose of make an active belligerent on side or the other third choice be to go to the heart of the trouble that mean clean out major north|vietnamese and vietcong occupy territory these sanctuary which serve as basis for attack on both cambodia and american and south|vietnamese force in south|vietnam some of these incidentally be as close to saigon as baltimore be to washington this one for example indicating be call the parrot 's beak be only|33|mile from saigon now face with these option this be the decision have make in cooperation with the armed force of south|vietnam attack be be launch this|week to clean out major enemy sanctuary on the cambodian vietnam border a major responsibility for the ground operation be be assume by south|vietnamese force for example the attack in several area include the parrot 's beak that refer to a moment ago be exclusively south|vietnamese ground operation under south|vietnamese command with the|united|state provide air and logistical support there be area however immediately above parrot 's beak where have conclude that a combine american and south|vietnamese operation be necessary tonight american and south|vietnamese unit will attack the headquarters for the entire communist military operation in south|vietnam this key control center have be occupy by and vietcong for five|years in blatant violation of cambodia 's neutrality this be not an invasion of cambodia the area in which these attack will be launch be completely occupy and control by north|vietnamese force purpose be not to occupy the area once enemy force be drive out of these sanctuary and once military supply be destroy will withdraw these action be in no way direct to the security interest of any nation any government that choose to use these action as a pretext for harm relation with the|united|state will be do so on own responsibility and on own initiative and will draw the appropriate conclusion now let give the reason for decision a majority of the american people a majority of listen to be for the withdrawal of force from vietnam the action have take tonight be indispensable for the continue success of that withdrawal program a majority of the american people want to end this war rather than to have drag on interminably the action have take tonight will serve that purpose a majority of the american people want to keep the casualty of brave man in vietnam at an absolute minimum the action take tonight be essential if be to accomplish that goal take this action not for the purpose of expand the war into cambodia but for the purpose of end the war in vietnam and win the just peace all desire have make â€” will continue to make every possible effort to end this war through negotiation at the conference table rather than through more fighting on the battlefield let look again at the record have stop the bombing of north|vietnam have cut air operation by have announce withdrawal of of man have offer to withdraw all of man if will withdraw have offer to negotiate all issue with only|one condition and that be that the future of south|vietnam be determine not by north|vietnam and not by the|united|state but by the people of south|vietnam the answer of the enemy have be intransigence at the conference table belligerence in hanoi massive military aggression in laos and cambodia and step up attack in south|vietnam design to increase american casualty this attitude have become intolerable will not react to this threat to american life merely by plaintive diplomatic protest if do the credibility of the|united|state would be destroy in every area of the world where only the power of deter aggression tonight again warn the north|vietnamese that if continue to escalate the fighting when the|united|state be withdraw force shall meet responsibility as commander in chief of armed|force to take the action consider necessary to defend the security of american man the action that have announce tonight put the leader of north|vietnam on notice that will be patient in work for peace will be conciliatory at the conference table but will not be humiliate will not be defeat will not allow american man by the thousand to be kill by an enemy from privileged sanctuary the time come long ago to end this war through peaceful negotiation stand ready for those negotiation have make major effort many of which must remain secret say tonight all the offer and approach make previously remain on the conference table whenever hanoi be ready to negotiate seriously but if the enemy response to most conciliatory offer for peaceful negotiation continue to be to increase attack and humiliate and defeat shall react accordingly fellow americans live in an age of anarchy both abroad and at home see mindless attack on all the great institution which have be create by free civilization in the|last|500|year even here in the|united|state great university be be systematically destroy small nation all over the world find under attack from within and from without if when the chip be down the world 's most powerful nation act like a pitiful helpless giant the force of totalitarianism and anarchy will threaten free nation and free institution throughout the world be not power but will and character that be be test tonight the question all americans must ask and answer tonight be this do the rich and strong nation in the history of the world have the character to meet a direct challenge by a group which reject every effort to win a just peace ignore warning trample on solemn agreement violate the neutrality of an unarmed people and use prisoner as hostage if fail to meet this challenge all other nation will be on notice that despite overwhelming power the|united|state when a real crisis come will be find want during campaign for the presidency pledge to bring americans home from vietnam be come home promise to end this war shall keep that promise promise to win a just peace shall keep that promise shall avoid a wide war but be also determined to put an end to this war in this room woodrow|wilson make the great decision which lead to victory in world|war|i.|franklin|roosevelt make the decision which lead to victory in world|war|ii dwight|d.|eisenhower make decision which end the war in korea and avoid war in the|middle|east john|f.|kennedy in his|finest|hour make the great decision which remove soviet nuclear missile from cuba and the|western|hemisphere have note that there have be a great deal of discussion with regard to this decision that have make and should point out that do not contend that be in the same magnitude as these decision that have just mention but between those decision and this decision there be a difference that be very fundamental in those decision the american people be not assail by counsel of doubt and defeat from some of the most widely know opinion leader of the nation have note for example that a republican senator have say that this action have take mean that party have lose all chance of win the november election and other be say today that this move against enemy sanctuary will make a term president no one be more aware than be of the political consequence of the action have take be tempting to take the easy political path to blame this war on previous administration and to bring all of man home immediately regardless of the consequence even though that would mean defeat for the|united|state to desert people who have put trust in and to expose to the same slaughter and savagery which the leader of north|vietnam inflict on hundreds|of|thousands of north|vietnamese who choose freedom when the communists take over north|vietnam in to get peace at any price now even though know that a peace of humiliation for the|united|state would lead to a big war or surrender later have reject all political consideration in make this decision whether party gain in november be nothing compare to the life of brave americans fight for country and for the cause of peace and freedom in vietnam whether may be a term president be insignificant compare to whether by failure to act in this crisis the|united|stat prove to be unworthy to lead the force of freedom in this critical period in world history would rather be a term president and do what believe be right than to be a term president at the cost of see america become a second rate power and to see this nation accept the first defeat in proud history realize that in this war there be honest and deep difference in this country about whether should have become involve that there be difference as to how the war should have be conduct but the decision announce tonight transcend those difference for the life of american man be involve the opportunity for americans to come home in the|next|12|month be involve the future of people in south|vietnam and people in cambodia be involve the possibility of win a just peace in vietnam and in the pacific be at stake be customary to conclude a speech from the|white|house by ask support for the president of the|united|state tonight depart from that precedent what ask be far more important ask for support for brave man fight tonight halfway around the world â€” not for territory not for glory but so that young brother and son and son can have a chance to grow up in a world of peace and freedom and justice thank and good night view transcript transcript mr. speaker mr. president colleague in the congress distinguished guest and fellow americans to address a joint session of the congress in this great chamber in which be once privileged to serve be an honor for which be deeply grateful the|state|of|the|union address be traditionally an occasion for a lengthy and detailed account by the president of what have accomplish in the past what want the congress to do in the future and in an|election|year to lay the basis for the political issue which may be decisive in the fall occasionally there come a time when profound and far reach event command a break with tradition this be such a time say this not only because mark the beginning of a|new|decade in which america will celebrate 200th birthday say because new knowledge and hard experience argue persuasively that both program and institution in america need to be reform the moment have arrive to harness the vast energy and abundance of this land to the creation of a new american experience an experience rich and deep and more truly a reflection of the goodness and grace of the human spirit the ' 70 will be a time of new beginning a time of explore both on the earth and in the heaven a time of discovery but the time have also come for emphasis on develop well way of manage what have and of complete what man 's genius have begin but leave unfinished land this land that be ours together be a great and a good land be also an unfinished land and the challenge of perfect be the summon of be in that spirit that address to those great issue face nation which be above partisanship when speak of america 's priority the first priority must always be peace for america and the world the major immediate goal of foreign policy be to bring an end to the war in vietnam in a way that generation will be remember not so much as the generation that suffer in war but more for the fact that have the courage and character to win the kind of a just peace that the next generation be able to keep be make progress toward that goal the prospect for peace be far great today than be a|year|ago a major part of the credit for this development go to the member of this congress who despite difference on the conduct of the war have overwhelmingly indicate support of a just peace by this action have completely demolish the enemy 's hope that can gain in washington the victory fighting man have deny in vietnam no goal could be great than to make the next generation the first in this|century in which america be at peace with every nation in the world shall discuss in detail the new concept and program design to achieve this goal in a separate report on foreign policy which shall submit to the congress at a later date today let describe the direction of new policy have base policy on an evaluation of the world as be not as be at the conclusion of world|war|ii many of the policy which be necessary and fight then be obsolete today then because of america 's overwhelming military and economic strength because of the weakness of other major free world power and the inability of score of newly independent nation to defend or even govern america have to assume the major burden for the defense of freedom in the world in war first in korea and now in vietnam furnish most of the money most of the arm most of the man to help other nation defend freedom today the great industrial nation of europe as well as japan have regain economic strength and the nation of latin|america â€” and many of the nation who acquire freedom from colonialism after world|war|ii in asia and africa â€” have a new sense of pride and dignity and a determination to assume the responsibility for own defense that be the basis of the doctrine announce at guam neither the defense nor the development of other nation can be exclusively or primarily an american undertaking the nation of each part of the world should assume the primary responsibility for own well being and should determine the term of that well being shall be faithful to treaty commitment but shall reduce involvement and presence in other nation ' affair to insist that other nation play a role be not a retreat from responsibility be a sharing of responsibility the result of this new policy have be not to weaken alliance but to give new life new strength a new sense of common purpose relation with european ally be once again strong and healthy base on mutual consultation and mutual responsibility have initiate a new approach to latin|america in which deal with those nation as partner rather than patron the new partnership concept have be welcome in asia have develop an historic new basis for japanese american friendship and cooperation which be the linchpin for peace in the pacific if be to have peace in a major factor will be the development of a new relationship between the|united|state and the|soviet|union would not underestimate difference but be move with precision and purpose from an era of confrontation to an era of negotiation negotiation on strategic arm limitation and in other area will have far great chance for success if both side enter motivate by mutual self interest rather than naive sentimentality be with this same spirit that have resume discussion with communist china in talk at warsaw concern in relation with both these nation be to avoid a catastrophic collision and to build a solid basis for peaceful settlement of difference would be the last to suggest that the road to peace be not difficult and dangerous but believe new policy have contribute to the prospect that america may have the good chance since world|war|ii to enjoy a generation of uninterrupted peace and that chance will be enormously increase if continue to have a relationship between congress and the executive in which despite difference in detail where the security of america and the peace of mankind be concern act not as republicans not as democrats but as americans as move into the|decade of have the great opportunity for progress at home of any people in world history gross national product will increase by in the|next|10|year this increase alone be great than the entire growth of the american economy from the critical question be not whether will grow but how will use that growth the|decade|of|the|'60s be also a period of great growth economically but in that same 10-year period witness the great growth of crime the great increase in inflation the great social unrest in america in never have a nation seem to have have more and enjoy less at heart the issue be the effectiveness of government have become â€” as continue to be and should remain â€” a society of large expectation government help to generate these expectation undertake to meet yet increasingly prove unable to do so as a people have too many vision and too little vision now as enter the ' 70 should enter also a great age of reform of the institution of american government purpose in this period should not be simply well management of the program of the past the time have come for a new quest a quest not for a great quantity of what have but for a new quality of life in america a major part of the substance for an unprecedented advance in this nation 's approach to problem and opportunity be contain in score legislative proposal which send to the congress last|year and which still await enactment will offer at|least|a|dozen more major program in the course of this session at this point do not intend to through a detailed listing of what have propose or will propose but would like to mention area in which urgent priority demand that move and move now first can not delay longer in accomplish a total reform of welfare system when a system penalize work break up home robs recipient of dignity there be no alternative to abolish that system and adopt in place the program of income support job training and work incentive which recommend to the congress last|year second the time have come to assess and reform all of institution of government at the federal state and local level be time for a new federalism in which after of power flow from the people and local and state government to washington d.c. will begin to flow from washington back to the state and to the people of the|united|state third must adopt reform which will expand the range of opportunity for all americans can fulfill the american dream only when each person have a fair chance to fulfill own dream this mean equal voting right equal employment opportunity and new opportunity for expand ownership because in order to be secure in human right people need access to property right could give similar example of the need for reform in program for health education housing transportation as well as other critical area which directly affect the well being of million of americans the people of the|united|state should wait no longer for these reform that would so deeply enhance the quality of life when speak of action which would be beneficial to the american people can think of none more important than for the congress to join this administration in the battle to stop the rise in the cost of living now realize be tempting to blame someone else for inflation some blame business for raise price some blame union for ask for more wage but a review of the stark fiscal fact of the|1960s clearly demonstrate where the primary blame for rise price must be place in the|decade|of|the|'60 the federal government spend more than take in in taxis in that|same|decade the american people pay the bill for that deficit in price increase which raise the cost of live for the average family of by per month in america now million of americans be force to go into debt today because the federal government decide to go into debt yesterday must balance federal budget so that american family will have a well chance to balance family budget only with the cooperation of the congress can meet this high priority objective of responsible government be on the right track have a balanced budget in this administration cut more|than|$7|billion out of spend plan in order to produce a surplus in and in spite of the fact that congress reduce revenue by shall recommend a balanced budget for but can assure that not only to present but to stay within a balanced budget require some very hard decision mean reject spending program which would benefit some of the people when net effect would result in price increase for all the people be time to quit put good money into bad program otherwise will end up with bad money and bad program recognize the political popularity of spending program and particularly in but unless stop the rise in price the cost of live for million of american family will become unbearable and government 's ability to plan program for progress for the future will become impossible in refer to budget cut there be area where have order an increase rather than a cut and that be the request of those agency with the responsibility for law enforcement have hear a great deal of overblown rhetoric during the ' 60 in which the word war have perhaps too often be use the war on poverty the war on misery the war on disease the war on hunger but if there be area where the word war be appropriate be in the fight against crime must declare and win the war against the criminal element which increasingly threaten city home and life have a tragic example of this problem in the nation 's capital for whose safety the congress and the executive have the primary responsibility doubt if many member of this congress who live more than a few block from here would dare leave car in the capitol garage and walk home alone tonight last|year this administration send to the congress separate piece of legislation deal with organized crime pornography street crime narcotic crime in none of these bill have reach desk for signature be confident that the congress will act now to adopt the legislation place before last|year in the executive have do everything can under exist law but new and strong weapon be need in that fight while be true that state and local law enforcement agency be the cut edge in the effort to eliminate street crime burglary murder proposal to have embody belief that the federal government should play a great role in work in partnership with these agency that be why federal spending for local law enforcement will double that budget for the primary responsibility for crime that affect individual be with local and state rather than with federal government but in the field of organize crime narcotic pornography the federal government have a special responsibility should fulfill and should make washington d.c. where have the primary responsibility an example to the nation and the world of respect for law rather than lawlessness now turn to a subject which next to desire for peace may well become the major concern of the american people in in the|next|10|year shall increase wealth by the profound question be do this mean will be rich in a real sense better off happy or do mean that in the|year|1980 the president stand in this place will look back on a|decade in which of people live in metropolitan area choke by traffic suffocate by smog poison by water deafen by noise and terrorize by crime these be not the great question that concern world leader at summit conference but people do not live at the summit live in the foothill of everyday experience and be time for all of to concern with the way real people live in real life the great question of the seventy be shall surrender to surrounding or shall make peace with nature and begin to make reparation for the damage have do to air to land and to water restore nature to natural state be a cause beyond party and beyond faction have become a common cause of all the people of this country be a cause of particular concern to young americans because more than will reap the grim consequence of failure to act on program which be need now if be to prevent disaster later clean air clean water open space these should once again be the birthright of every american if act now can be still think of air as free but clean air be not free and neither be clean water the price tag on pollution control be high through our|year of past carelessness incur a debt to nature and now that debt be be call the program shall propose to congress will be the most comprehensive and costly program in this field in america 's history be not a program for just|one|year a year 's plan in this field be no plan at all this be a time to look ahead not a|year but five|year or whatever time be require to do the job shall propose to this congress a nationwide clean water program to put modern municipal waste treatment plant in every place in america where be need to make water clean again and do now have the industrial capacity if begin now to build all within five|year this program will get build within five|year as city and suburb relentlessly expand those priceless open space need for recreation area accessible to people be swallow up â€” often forever unless preserve these space while be still available will have none to preserve therefore shall propose new financing method for purchase open space and parkland now before be lose to the automobile be bad polluter of the air adequate control require further advance in engine design and fuel composition shall intensify research set increasingly strict standard and strengthen enforcement procedure and shall do now can no longer afford to consider air and water common property free to be abuse by anyone without regard to the consequence instead should begin now to treat as scarce resource which be no more free to contaminate than be free to throw garbage into neighbor 's yard this require comprehensive new regulation also require that to the extent possible the price of good should be make to include the cost of produce and dispose of without damage to the environment now realize that the argument be often make that there be a fundamental contradiction between economic growth and the quality of life so that to have must forsake the other the answer be not to abandon growth but to redirect for example should turn toward end congestion and eliminate smog the same reservoir of inventive genius that create in the first place continued vigorous economic growth provide with the mean to enrich life and to enhance planet as a place hospitable to man each individual must enlist in this fight if be to be win have be say that no matter how many national park and historical monument buy and develop the truly significant environment for each of be that in which spend of time in home in place of work the street over which travel street litter rundown parking strip and yard dilapidated fence broken window smoking automobile dingy working place all should be the object of fresh view have be too tolerant of surrounding and too willing to leave to other to clean up environment be time for those who make massive demand on society to make some minimal demand on each of must resolve that each|day will leave home property the public place of the city or town a little clean a little well a little more pleasant for and those around with the help of people can do anything and without help can do nothing in this spirit together can reclaim land for our and generation to come between|now|and|the|year|5000 over|100|million child will be bear in the|united|state where grow up and how will more than any thing measure the quality of american life in this should be a warning to for the|past|30|year population have also be grow and shift the result be exemplify in the vast area of rural america empty out of people and of promise a third of county lose population in the|'60s the violent and decay central city of great metropolitan complex be the most conspicuous area of failure in american life today propose that before these problem become insoluble the nation develop a national growth policy in the future government decision as to where to build highway locate airport acquire land or sell land should be make with a clear objective of aid a balanced growth for america in particular the federal government must be in a position to assist in the building of new city and the rebuilding of old one at the same time will carry concern with the quality of life in america to the farm as well as the suburb to the village as well as to the city what rural america need most be a new kind of assistance need to be deal with not as a separate nation but as part of an overall growth policy for america

americans tonight want to talk to on a subject of deep concern to all americans and to many people in all part of the world the war in vietnam believe that of the reason for the deep division about vietnam be that many americans have lose confidence in what government have tell about policy the american people can not and should not be ask to support a policy which involve the overriding issue of war and peace unless know the truth about that policy tonight therefore would like to answer some of the question that know be on the mind of many of listen to how and why do america get involve in vietnam in the first place how have this administration change the policy of the previous administration what have really happen in the negotiation in paris and on the battlefront in vietnam what choice do have if be to end the war what be the prospect for peace now let begin by describe the situation find when be inaugurate on january|20 â€”the war have be go on for 4|year americans have be kill in action â€”the training program for the|south|vietnamese be behind schedule â€”540,000 americans be in vietnam with no plan to reduce the number â€”no progress have be make at the negotiation in paris and the|united|state have not put forth a comprehensive peace proposal â€”the war be cause deep division at home and criticism from many of friend as well as enemy abroad in view of these circumstance there be some who urge that end the war at once by order the immediate withdrawal of all american force from a political standpoint this would have be a popular and easy course to follow after all become involved in the war while predecessor be in office could blame the defeat which would be the result of action on and come out as the peacemaker some put to quite bluntly this be the only way to avoid allow johnson 's war to become nixon 's war but have a great obligation than to think only of the year of administration and of the next election have to think of the effect of decision on the next generation and on the future of peace and freedom in america and in the world let all understand that the question before be not whether some americans be for peace and some americans be against peace the question at issue be not whether johnson 's war become nixon 's war the great question be how can win america 's peace well let turn now to the fundamental issue why and how do the|united|state become involved in vietnam in the first place fifteen|years|ago north|vietnam with the logistical support of communist china and the|soviet|union launch a campaign to impose a communist government on south|vietnam by instigate and support a revolution in response to the request of the|government|of|south|vietnam president eisenhower send economic aid and military equipment to assist the people of south|vietnam in effort to prevent a communist takeover seven|years|ago president kennedy send military personnel to vietnam as combat adviser four|years|ago president johnson send american combat force to south|vietnam now many believe that president johnson 's decision to send american combat force to south|vietnam be wrong and many other among â€” have be strongly critical of the way the war have be conduct but the question face today be now that be in the war what be the good way to end in january could only conclude that the precipitate withdrawal of american force from vietnam would be a disaster not only for south|vietnam but for the|united|state and for the cause of peace for the south|vietnamese precipitate withdrawal would inevitably allow the communists to repeat the massacre which follow takeover in the|north|15|years|before â€”they then murder people and hundreds|of|thousands more die in slave labor camp â€”we see a prelude of what would happen in south|vietnam when the communists enter the city of hue last|year during brief rule there there be a bloody reign of terror in which civilian be club shoot to death and bury in mass grave â€”with the sudden collapse of support these atrocity of hue would become the nightmare of the entire nation and particularly for the|million|and|a|half catholic refugee who flee to south|vietnam when the communist take over in the north for the|united|state this first defeat in nation 's history would result in a collapse of confidence in american leadership not only in asia but throughout the world american president have recognize the great stake involve in vietnam and understand what have to be do in president kennedy with characteristic eloquence and clarity say want to see a stable government there carry on a struggle to maintain national independence believe strongly in that be not go to withdraw from that effort in opinion for to withdraw from that effort would mean a collapse not only of south|viet nam but southeast|asia so be go to stay there president eisenhower and president johnson express the same conclusion during term of office for the future of peace precipitate withdrawal would thus be a disaster of immense magnitude â€”a nation can not remain great if betray ally and let down friend defeat and humiliation in south|vietnam without question would promote recklessness in the council of those great power who have not yet abandon goal of world conquest would spark violence wherever commitment help maintain the peace in the|middle|east in berlin eventually even in the|western|hemisphere ultimately this would cost more life would not bring peace would bring more war for these reason reject the recommendation that should end the war by immediately withdraw all of force choose instead to change american policy on both the negotiating front and battlefront in order to end a war fight on many front initiate a pursuit for peace on many front in a television speech on in a speech before the|united|nation and on a number of other occasion set forth peace proposal in great detail â€”we have offer the complete withdrawal of all outside force within one|year â€”we have propose a cease fire under international supervision â€”we have offer free election under international supervision with the communists participate in the organization and conduct of the election as an organized political force and the|saigon|government have pledge to accept the result of the election have not put forth proposal on a take or leave basis have indicate that be willing to discuss the proposal that have be put forth by the other side have declare that anything be negotiable except the fight of the people of south|vietnam to determine own future at the paris peace conference ambassador lodge have demonstrate flexibility and good faith in public meeting hanoi have refuse even to discuss proposal demand unconditional acceptance of term which be that withdraw all american force immediately and unconditionally and that overthrow the|government|of|south|vietnam as leave have not limit peace initiative to public forum and public statement recognize in january that a long and bitter war like this usually can not be settle in a public forum that be why in addition to the public statement and negotiation have explore every possible private avenue that may lead to a settlement tonight be take the unprecedented step of disclose to some of other initiative for peace initiative undertake privately and secretly because think thereby may open a door which publicly would be close do not wait for inauguration to begin quest for peace â€”soon after election through an individual who be directly in contact on a personal basis with the leader of north|vietnam make private offer for a rapid comprehensive settlement hanoi 's reply call in effect for surrender before negotiation â€”since the soviet|union furnish most of the military equipment for north|vietnam secretary of state|rogers assistant for national|security|affairs dr. kissinger ambassador lodge and personally have meet on a number of occasion with representative of the|soviet|government to enlist assistance in get meaningful negotiation start in addition have have extend discussion direct toward that same end with representative of other government which have diplomatic relation with north|vietnam none of these initiative have to date produce result â€”in mid - july become convinced that be necessary to make a major move to break the deadlock in the paris talk speak directly in this office where be now sit with an individual who have know ho|chi|minh president democratic|republic|of|vietnam on a personal basis for through send a letter to ho|chi|minh do this outside of the usual diplomatic channel with the hope that with the necessity of make statement for propaganda remove there may be constructive progress toward bring the war to an end let read from that letter to now dear mr. president realize that be difficult to communicate meaningfully across the gulf of four|year of war but precisely because of this gulf want to take this opportunity to reaffirm in all solemnity desire to work for a just peace deeply believe that the war in vietnam have go on too long and delay in bring to an end can benefit no one least of all the people of vietnam the time have come to move forward at the conference table toward an early resolution of this tragic war will find forthcoming and open minded in a common effort to bring the blessing of peace to the brave people of vietnam let history record that at this critical juncture both side turn face toward peace rather than toward conflict and war receive ho|chi|minh 's reply on august|30,|3|days before death simply reiterate the public position north|vietnam have take at paris and flatly reject initiative the full text of both letter be be release to the press â€”in addition to the public meeting that have refer to ambassador lodge have meet with vietnam 's chief negotiator in paris in private session â€”we have take other significant initiative which must remain secret to keep open some channel of communication which may still prove to be productive but the effect of all the public private and secret negotiation which have be undertake since the bombing halt a|year|ago and since this administration come into office on january|20 can be sum up in sentence no progress whatever have be make except agreement on the shape of the bargaining table well now who be at fault have become clear that the obstacle in negotiate an end to the war be not the president of the|united|state be not the|south|vietnamese|government the obstacle be the other side 's absolute refusal to show the least willingness to join in seek a just peace and will not do so while be convince that all have to do be to wait for next concession and next concession after that one until get everything want there can now be no longer any question that progress in negotiation depend only on hanoi 's decide to negotiate to negotiate seriously realize that this report on effort on the diplomatic front be discourage to the american people but the american people be entitle to know the truth the bad news as well as the good news where the life of young man be involve now let turn however to a more encouraging report on another front at the time launch search for peace recognize may not succeed in bring an end to the war through negotiation therefore put into effect another plan to bring peace a plan which will bring the war to an end regardless of what happen on the negotiating front be in line with a major shift in u.s. foreign policy which describe in press conference at guam on july|25 let briefly explain what have be describe as the nixon doctrine a policy which not only will help end the war in vietnam but which be an essential element of program to prevent future vietnams americans be a do people be an impatient people instead of teach someone else to do a job like to do and this trait have be carry over into foreign policy in korea and again in vietnam the|united|state furnish most of the money most of the arm and most of the man to help the people of those country defend freedom against communist aggression before any american troop be commit to vietnam a leader of another asian country express this opinion to when be travel in asia as a private citizen say when be try to assist another nation defend freedom u.s. policy should be to help fight the war but not to fight the war for well in accordance with this wise counsel lay down in guam principle as guideline for future american policy toward asia â€”first the|united|state will keep all of treaty commitment shall provide a shield if a nuclear power threaten the freedom of a nation ally with or of a nation whose survival consider vital to security in case involve other type of aggression shall furnish military and economic assistance when request in accordance with treaty commitment but shall look to the nation directly threaten to assume the primary responsibility of provide the manpower for defense after announce this policy find that the leader of the philippines thailand vietnam south|korea and other nation which may be threaten by communist aggression welcome this new direction in american foreign policy the defense of freedom be everybody 's business â€” not just america 's business and be particularly the responsibility of the people whose freedom be threaten in the previous administration americanize the war in vietnam in this administration be vietnamize the search for peace the policy of the previous administration not only result in assume the primary responsibility for fight the war but even more significantly do not adequately stress the goal of strengthen so that could defend when leave the vietnamization plan be launch follow secretary laird 's visit to vietnam in march under the plan order first a substantial increase in the training and equipment of south|vietnamese force in july on visit to vietnam change general abrams ' order so that be consistent with the objective of new policy under the new order the primary mission of troop be to enable the south|vietnamese force to assume the full responsibility for the security of south|vietnam air operation have be reduce by and now have begin to see the result of this long overdue change in american policy in vietnam â€”afte of americans go into vietnam be finally bring american man home by december|15 man will have be withdraw from include of all of combat force â€”the south|vietnamese have continue to gain in strength as a result have be able to take over combat responsibility from american troop other significant development have occur since this administration take office infiltration infiltration which be essential if be to launch a major attack over the|last|3|months be less|than|20|percent of what be over the|same|period|last|year important united|stat casualty have decline during the|last|2|months to the low point in 3|year let now turn to program for the future have adopt a plan which have work out in cooperation with the|south|vietnamese for the complete withdrawal of all u.s. combat ground force and replacement by south|vietnamese force on an orderly schedule timetable this withdrawal will be make from strength and not from weakness as force become strong the rate of american withdrawal can become great have not and do not intend to announce the timetable for program and there be obvious reason for this decision which be sure will understand as have indicate on several occasion the rate of withdrawal will depend on development on front of these be the progress which can be or may be make in the paris talk an announcement of a fix timetable for withdrawal would completely remove any incentive for the enemy to negotiate an agreement would simply wait until force have withdraw and then move in the other factor on which will base withdrawal decision be the level of enemy activity and the progress of the training program of the south|vietnamese force and be glad to be able to report tonight progress on both of these front have be great than anticipate when start the program in june for withdrawal as a result timetable for withdrawal be more optimistic now than when make first estimate in june now this clearly demonstrate why be not wise to be freeze in on a fix timetable must retain the flexibility to base each withdrawal decision on the situation as be at that time rather than on estimate that be no longer valid along with this optimistic estimate must â€” in all candor â€” leave note of caution if the level of enemy activity significantly increase may have to adjust timetable accordingly however want the record to be completely clear on point at the time of the bombing halt just|a|year|ago there be some confusion as to whether there be an understanding on the part of the enemy that if stop the bombing of north|vietnam would stop the shelling of city in south|vietnam want to be sure that there be no misunderstanding on the part of the enemy with regard to withdrawal program have note the reduce level of infiltration the reduction of casualty and be base withdrawal decision partially on those factor if the level of infiltration or casualty increase while be try to scale down the fighting will be the result of a conscious decision by the enemy hanoi could make no great mistake than to assume that an increase in violence will be to advantage if conclude that increase enemy action jeopardize remain force in vietnam shall not hesitate to take strong and effective measure to deal with that situation this be not a threat this be a statement of policy which as commander in chief of armed|force be make in meet responsibility for the protection of american fighting man wherever may be fellow americans be sure can recognize from what have say that really only have choice open to if want to end this war â€”i can order an immediate precipitate withdrawal of all americans from vietnam without regard to the effect of that action â€”or can persist in search for a just peace through a negotiate settlement if possible or through continued implementation of plan for vietnamization if necessary a plan in which will withdraw all of force from vietnam on a schedule in accordance with program as the south|vietnamese become strong enough to defend own freedom have choose this second course be not the easy way be the right way be a plan which will end the war and serve the cause of peace â€” not just in vietnam but in the pacific and in the world in speaking of the consequence of a precipitate withdrawal mention that ally would lose confidence in america far more dangerous would lose confidence in oh the immediate reaction would be a sense of relief that man be come home but as see the consequence of what have do inevitable remorse and divisive recrimination would scar spirit as a people have face other crisis in history and have become strong by reject the easy way out and take the right way in meet challenge greatness as a nation have be capacity to do what have to be do when know course be right recognize that some of fellow citizen disagree with the plan for peace have choose honest and patriotic americans have reach different conclusion as to how peace should be achieve in san|francisco a|few|weeks|ago see demonstrator carry sign read lose in vietnam bring the boy home well of the strength of free society be that any american have a right to reach that conclusion and to advocate that point of view but as president of the|united|state would be untrue to oath of office if allow the policy of this nation to be dictate by the minority who hold that point of view and who try to impose on the nation by mount demonstration in the street for almost|200|year the policy of this nation have be make under constitution by those leader in the congress and the|white|house elect by all of the people if a vocal minority however fervent cause prevail over reason and the will of the majority this nation have no future as a free society and now would like to address a word if may to the young people of this nation who be particularly concerned and understand why be concern about this war respect idealism share concern for peace want peace as much as do there be powerful personal reason want to end this war this|week will have to sign letter to mother father wife and love one of man who have give life for america in vietnam be very little satisfaction to that this be only|one third as many letter as sign the|first|week in office there be nothing want more than to see the|day come when do not have to write any of those letter want to end the war to save the life of those brave young man in vietnam want to end in a way which will increase the chance that young brother and son will not have to fight in some future vietnam someplace in the world â€”and want to end the war for another reason want to end so that the energy and dedication of young people now too often direct into bitter hatred against those responsible for the war can be turn to the great challenge of peace a well life for all americans a well life for all people on this earth have choose a plan for peace believe will succeed if do succeed what the critic say now will not matter if do not succeed anything say then will not matter know may not be fashionable to speak of patriotism or national destiny these|days but feel be appropriate to do so on this occasion two|hundred|years|ago this nation be weak and poor but even then america be the hope of million in the world today have become the strong and rich nation in the world and the wheel of destiny have turn so that any hope the world have for the survival of peace and freedom will be determine by whether the american people have the moral stamina and the courage to meet the challenge of free world leadership let historian not record that when america be the most powerful nation in the world pass on the other side of the road and allow the last hope for peace and freedom of million of people to be suffocate by the force of totalitarianism and so tonight to the great silent majority of fellow americans ask for support pledge in campaign for the presidency to end the war in a way that could win the peace have initiate a plan of action which will enable to keep that pledge the more support can have from the american people the sooner that pledge can be redeem for the more divided be at home the less likely the enemy be to negotiate at paris let be unite for peace let also be unite against defeat because let understand north|vietnam can not defeat or humiliate the|united|state only americans can do that fifty|years|ago in this room and at this very desk president woodrow|wilson speak word which catch the imagination of a war weary world say this be the war to end war dream for peace after world|war|i be shatter on the hard reality of great power politic and

great goal to which woodrow|wilson and every american president in history have be dedicate the goal of a just and last peace as president hold the responsibility for choose the good path to that goal

talk mean by that talk in which the|government|of|vietnam be free to participate ambassador also stress that could not stop the bombing so long as by do so would endanger the life and the safety of

conform to the statement that have make in the past concern a bombing cessation be on august|19th that the president say this administration do not intend to move further until have good reason to

be conducive to progress have reach the stage where productive talk can begin have make clear to the other side that such talk can not continue if take military advantage of can not have productive talk in an atmosphere where the city be be shell and where the demilitarize zone be be abuse think should caution fellow americans that arrangement of this kind be never foolproof for that matter even formal treaty be never foolproof as have learn from experience but in the light of the progress that have be make in recent|weeks and after carefully consider and weigh the unanimous military and diplomatic advice and judgment render to the commander in chief have finally decide to take this step now and to really determine the good faith of those who have assure that progress will result when bombing cease and to try to ascertain if an early peace be possible the overriding consideration that govern at this|hour be the chance and the opportunity that may have to save human life save human life on both side of the conflict therefore have conclude that should see if be act in good faith could be mislead and be prepared for such a contingency pray god do not occur but should be clear to all of that the new phase of negotiation which open on november|6th do not repeat do not â€” mean that a stable peace have yet come to southeast|asia there may well be very hard fight ahead certainly there be go to be some very hard negotiating because many difficult and critically important issue be still face these negotiator but hope and believe that with good will can solve know that

effectiveness of these man have steadily improve â€”the superb performance of own man under the brilliant leadership of general|westmoreland and general abrams have produce truly remarkable result now perhaps some or all of these factor play a part in bring about progress in the talk and when at last progress do come believe that responsibility to the brave man man who bear the burden of battle in

view transcript transcript mayor daley mr. wasilewski lady and gentleman some of may have think from what say last|night that have be take elocution lesson from lowell|thomas of aide say this|morning thing be really get confused around washington mr. president say how be that say look to like be go to the wrong convention in chicago say well what overlook be that be april|fool once again be enter the period of national festivity which henry|adams call the dance of democracy at good that can be a time of debate and enlightenment at bad can be a period of frenzy but always be a time when emotion threaten to substitute for reason yet the basic hope of a democracy be that somehow amid all the frenzy and all the emotion in the end reason will prevail reason just must prevail if democracy be to survive as say last|evening there be very deep and very emotional division in this land that love today domestic division division over the war in vietnam with all of heart just wish this be not so entire career in public life some|37|year of have be devote to the art of find an area of agreement because generally speak have observe that there be so many more thing to unite americans than there be to divide but somehow or other have a facility sometimes of emphasize the division and the thing that divide instead of discuss the thing that unite sometimes have be call a seeker of consensus"--more often that have be criticism of action instead of praise of but have never deny because to heal and to build support to hold people together be something think be worthy and believe be a noble task be certainly a challenge for all of in this land and this world where there be restlessness and uncertainty and danger in region of the country where have spend life where brother be once divide against brother heritage have burn this lesson and have burn deep in memory yet along the way learn somewhere that no leader can pursue public tranquillity as first and only goal for a president to buy public popularity at the sacrifice of well judgment be too dear a price to pay this nation can not afford such a price and this nation can not long afford such a leader so the thing that divide country this|morning will be discuss throughout the land be certain that the very great majority of informed americans will act as have always act to do what be good for country and what serve the national interest but the real problem of inform the people be still with think can speak with some authority about the problem of communication understand far better than some of severe and perhaps intolerant critic would admit own shortcoming as a communicator how do a public leader find just the right word or the right way to say no more or no less than mean to say bear in mind that anything say may topple government and may involve the life of innocent man how do that leader speak the right phrase in the right way under the right condition to suit the accuracy and contingency of the moment when be discuss question of policy so that do not stir a misinterpretation and leave the wrong connotation or impression how do reach the immediate audience and how do communicate with the million of other who be out there listen from afar the president who must call people and summon to meet responsibility as citizen in a hard and an endure war often ponder these question and search for the right course man and woman who be master of the broadcast medium surely must know what be talk about be a long time ago when a president once say the printing press be the most powerful weapon with which man have ever arm in age the electronic medium have add immeasurably to man 's power have within hand the mean to make nation as intimate and as inform as a new|england town meeting yet the use of broadcasting have not clear away all of the problem that still have of communication in some way think sometimes have complicate because tend to put the leader in a time capsule require often to abbreviate what have to say too often may catch a random phrase from rather lengthy discourse and project as the whole story how many man wonder mayor daley in public life have watch on a tv newscast and then be tempt to exclaim can that really be well there be no deny of the broadcast industry have enormous power in hand have the power to clarify and have the power to confuse man in public life can not remotely rival opportunity clay after day night after night,|hour|after|hour|on|the|hour and the|half|hour sometimes shape the nation 's dialogue the word that choose hopefully always accurate and hopefully always just be the word that be carry out for all of the people to hear the commentary that provide can give the real meaning to the issue of the|day or can distort beyond all meaning by standard of what be news can cultivate wisdom or can nurture misguided passion commentary carry an add element of uncertainty unlike the print medium television write on the wind there be no accumulate record which the historian can examine later with a vision of hindsight ask these question how fair be tonight how impartial be today how honest be all along well hope the|national|association|of|broadcaster with whom have have a pleasant association for many|years will point the way to all of in develop this kind of a record because history be go to be ask very hard question about time and the period through which be pass think that all owe to history to complete the record but do not come here this|morn to sermonize in matter of fairness and judgment no law or no set of regulation and no word of can improve or dictate daily responsibility all mean to do and what be try to do be to remind where there be great power there must also be great responsibility this be true for broadcaster just as be true for president and seeker for the presidency what say and what do now will shape the kind of a world that pass along to child and grandchild keep this thought constantly in mind during and the somewhat long night when crisis come at home and abroad take a little of prime time last|night would not have do that except for a very prime purpose report on the prospect for peace in vietnam announce that the|united|states be take a very important unilateral act of de - escalation which could and fervently pray will lead to mutual move to reduce the level of violence and to deescalate the war as sit in office last|evening wait to speak think of the many time each|week when television bring the war into the american home no one can say exactly what effect those vivid scene have on american opinion historians must only guess at the effect that television would have have during early conflict on the future of this nation the korean war for example at that time when force be push back there to pusan world|war|ii or when man be slug out in europe or when most of air|force be shoot down that day in june|1942 off australia but last|night television be be use to carry a different message be a message of peace occur to that the medium may be somewhat better suited to convey the action of conflict than to dramatize the word that the leader use in try and hope to end the conflict certainly be more dramatic to show policeman and rioter lock in combat than to show man try to cooperate with another the face of hatred and of bigotry come through much more clearly no matter what color the face of tolerance seem to find be rarely newsworthy progress whether be a man be train for a job or million be train or whether be a child in head start learn to read or an old person of in adult education or be care for in medicare rarely make the news although more|than|20|million of be affect by perhaps this be because tolerance and progress be not dynamic event such as riot and conflict be event peace in the news sense be a condition war be an event part of responsibility be simply to understand the consequence of that fact the consequence of own act and part of that responsibility think be to try as very good all can to draw the attention of people to the real business of society in system find and secure peace in the world at home and abroad for all that have do and that be do and that will do to this end thank and commend pray that the message of peace that try so hard to convey last|night will be accept in good faith by the leader of north|vietnam pray that time soon the evening news show will have not another battle in the scarred hill of vietnam but will show man enter a room to talk about peace that be the event that think the american people be yearn and longing to see president thieu of vietnam and government be now engage in very urgent political and economic task which refer to last|night and which regard as very constructive and hopeful hope the government of south vietnam make great progress in the|days|ahead but some time in the|week ahead immediately hope president thieu will be in a position to accept invitation to visit the|united|state so can come here and see people too and together can strengthen and improve plan to advance the|day of peace pray that and that every american will take to heart plea that guard against divisiveness have win too much have come too far and have open too many door of opportunity for these thing now to be lose in a divided country where brother be separate from brother for the time that be allot shall do everything in man 's power to hasten the|day when the world be at peace and americans of all race and all creed of all conviction can live

peace talk since last|september have carry the offer that make public at that offer be this that the|united|states would stop bombardment of north|vietnam when that would lead promptly to productive discussion and that would assume that north|vietnam would not take military advantage of restraint hanoi denounce this offer both privately and publicly even while the search for peace be go on north|vietnam rush preparation for a savage assault on the people the government and the ally of south|vietnam attack during the tet holiday fail to achieve principal objective do not collapse the elect government of south|vietnam or shatter army as the communists have hope do not produce a general uprising among the people of the city as have predict the communists be unable to maintain control of any of the more|than|30 city that attack and take very heavy casualty but do compel the south|vietnamese and ally to move certain force from the countryside into the city cause widespread disruption and suffering attack and the battle that follow make refugee of human being the communists may renew attack any day be appear try to make the|year of decision in south|vietnam â€” the year that bring if not final victory or defeat at least a turning point in the struggle this much be clear if do mount another round of heavy attack will not succeed in destroy the fighting power of south|vietnam and ally but tragically this be also clear many man on both side of the struggle will be lose a nation that have already suffer of warfare will suffer once again army on both side will take new casualty and the war will go on there be no need for this to be so there be no need to delay the talk that could bring an end to this long and this bloody war tonight renew the offer make last|august to stop the bombardment of north|vietnam ask that talk begin promptly that be serious talk on the substance of peace assume that during those talk hanoi will not take advantage of

â€” substantially reduce â€” the present level of hostility and be do so unilaterally and at once tonight have order aircraft and naval vessel to make no attack on north|vietnam except in the area north of the demilitarize zone where the continue enemy buildup directly threaten ally forward position and where the movement of troop and supply be clearly related to that threat the area in which be stop attack include almost|90|percent of north|vietnam 's population and most of territory thus there will be no attack around the principal populate area or in the food produce area of north|vietnam even this very limited bombing of the north could come to an early end if restraint be match by restraint in hanoi but can not in good conscience stop all bombing so long as to do so would immediately and directly endanger the life of man and ally whether a complete bombing halt become possible in the future will be determine by event purpose in this action be to bring about a reduction in the level of violence that now exist be to save the life of brave man and to save the life of innocent woman and child be to permit the contend force to move closer to a political settlement and tonight call upon and call upon the|soviet|union as cochairman of the|geneva|conference and as permanent member of the|united|nations|security|council â€” to do all can to move from the unilateral act of deescalation that have just announce toward genuine peace in southeast|asia now as in the past the|united|states be ready to send representative to any forum at any time to discuss the mean of bring this ugly war to an end be designate of most distinguished americans ambassador averell|harriman as personal representative for such talk in addition have ask ambassador llewellyn|thompson who return from moscow for consultation to be available to join ambassador harriman at geneva or any other suitable place just as soon as hanoi agree to a conference call upon president ho|chi|minh to respond positively and favorably to this new step toward peace but if peace do not come now through negotiation will come when hanoi understand that common resolve be unshakable and common strength be invincible tonight and the other allied nation be contribute fight man to assist south|vietnamese troop in defend little country presence there have always rest on this basic belief the main burden of preserve freedom must be carry out by by the south|vietnamese and ally can only help to provide a shield behind which the people of south|vietnam can survive and can grow and develop on effort on determination and resourcefulness the outcome will ultimately depend that small beleaguered nation have suffer terrible punishment for more|than|20|year pay tribute once again tonight to the great courage and endurance of people south|vietnam support armed force tonight of almost|700,000 man and call attention to the fact that this be the equivalent of in own population people maintain firm determination to be free of domination by the north there have be substantial progress think in build a durable government during these|last|3|years the|south|vietnam of could not have survive the enemy 's tet offensive of the elect government of south|vietnam survive that attack and be rapidly repair the devastation that work the south|vietnamese know that further effort be go to be require â€”to expand own armed force â€”to move back into the countryside as quickly as possible â€”to increase taxis â€”to select the very good man that have for civil and military responsibility â€”to achieve a new unity within constitutional government and â€”to include in the national effort all those group who wish to preserve south vietnam 's control over own destiny last|week president thieu order the mobilization of additional south|vietnamese plan to reach â€” as soon as possible a total military strength of more|than|800,000 man to achieve this the|government|of|south|vietnam start the drafting of 19-year old on march|1st on may|1st the government will begin the drafting of 18-year old last|month man volunteer for military service that be two|and|a|half time the number of volunteer during the|same|month|last|year since the|middle|of|january more|than|48,000 south|vietnamese have join the armed force and nearly|half of volunteer to do so all man in the south|vietnamese armed force have have tour of duty extend for the duration of the war and reserve be now be call up for immediate active duty president thieu tell people last|week must make great effort and accept more sacrifice because as have say many time this be country the existence of nation be at stake and this be mainly a vietnamese responsibility warn people that a major national effort be require to root out corruption and incompetence at all level of government applaud this evidence of determination on the part of south|vietnam first priority will be to support effort shall accelerate the reequipment of south|vietnam 's armed force in order to meet the enemy 's increase firepower this will enable progressively to undertake a large share of combat operation against the communist invader on many occasion have tell the american people that would send to vietnam those force that be require to accomplish mission there so with that as guide have previously authorize a force level of approximately|525,000 some|weeks|ago â€” to help meet the enemy 's new offensive send to vietnam about|11,000 additional marine and airborne troop be deploy by air in on an emergency basis but the artillery tank aircraft medical and other unit that be need to work with and to support these infantry troop in combat could not then accompany by air on that short notice in order that these force may reach maximum combat effectiveness the|joint|chiefs|of|staff have recommend to that should prepare to send â€” during the|next|5|months support troop total approximately|13,500 man a portion of these man will be make available from active force the balance will come from reserve component unit which will be call up for service the action that have take since â€”to reequip the south|vietnamese force â€”to meet responsibility in korea as well as responsibility in vietnam â€”to meet price increase and the cost of activate and deploy reserve force â€”to replace helicopter and provide the other military supply need all of these action be go to require additional expenditure the tentative estimate of those additional expenditure be in this|fiscal|year and in the|next|fiscal|year these project increase in expenditure for national security will bring into sharp focus the nation 's need for immediate action action to protect the prosperity of the american people and to protect the strength and the stability of american dollar on many occasion have point out that without a tax bill or decrease expenditure next|year 's deficit would again be around|$20|billion have emphasize the need to set strict priority in spending have stress that failure to act and to act promptly and decisively would raise very strong doubt throughout the world about america 's willingness to keep financial house in order yet congress have not act and tonight face the sharp financial threat in the postwar era a threat to the dollar 's role as the keystone of international trade and finance in the world last|week at the monetary conference in stockholm the major industrial country decide to take a big step toward create a new international monetary asset that will strengthen the international monetary system be very proud of the very able work do by secretary fowler and chairman martin of the|federal|reserve|board but to make this system work the|united|state just must bring balance of payment to â€” or very close to â€” equilibrium must have a responsible fiscal policy in this country the passage of a tax bill now together with expenditure control that the congress may desire and dictate be absolutely necessary to protect this nation 's security to continue prosperity and to meet the need of people what be at stake be of unparalleled prosperity in those|7|year the real income of the average american after taxis rise by almost|30|percent a gain as large as that of the entire precede so the step that must take to convince the world be exactly the step must take to sustain own economic strength here at home in price and interest rate have rise because of inaction must therefore now do everything can to move from debate to action from talk to voting there be believe hope there be in both houses of the congress a grow sense of urgency that this situation just must be act upon and must be correct budget in january be think a tight fully reflect evaluation of most of the demand need of this nation but in these budgetary matter the president do not decide alone the congress have the power and the duty to determine appropriation and taxis the congress be now consider proposal and be consider reduction in the budget that submit as part of a program of fiscal restraint that include the tax surcharge shall approve appropriate reduction in the january budget when and if congress so decide that that should be do thing be unmistakably clear however deficit just must be reduce failure to act could bring on condition that would strike hardest at those people that all of be try so hard to help these time call for prudence in this land of plenty believe that have the character to provide and tonight plead with the congress and with the people to act promptly to serve the national interest and thereby serve all of people now let give estimate of the chance for peace â€”the peace that will day stop the bloodshed in south|vietnam â€”that will permit all the vietnamese people to rebuild and develop land â€”that will permit to turn more fully to own task here at home can not promise that the initiative that have announce tonight will be completely successful in achieve peace any more than the other that have undertake and agree to in recent|years but be fervent hope that north|vietnam after year of fighting that have leave the issue unresolved will now cease effort to achieve a military victory and will join with in move toward the peace table and there may come a time when south|vietnamese on both side â€” be able to work out a way to settle own difference by free political choice rather than by war as hanoi consider course should be in no doubt of intention must not miscalculate the pressure within democracy in this|election|year have no intention of widen this war but the|united|state will never accept a fake solution to this long and arduous struggle and call peace no one can foretell the precise term of an eventual settlement objective in south|vietnam have never be the annihilation of the enemy have be to bring about a recognition in hanoi that objective take over the south by force could not be achieve think that peace can be base on the|geneva|accord of political condition that permit all to chart course free of any outside domination or interference from or from anyone else so tonight reaffirm the pledge that make at manila â€” that be prepared to withdraw force from south|vietnam as the other side withdraw force to the north stop the infiltration and the level of violence thus subside goal of peace and self determination in vietnam be directly relate to the future of all of southeast|asia where much have happen to inspire confidence during the|past|10|years have do all that know how to do to contribute and to help build that confidence a number of nation have show what can be accomplish under condition of security since indonesia the fifth large nation in all the world with a population of people have have a government that be dedicate to peace with neighbor and improved condition for own people political and economic cooperation between nation have grow rapidly think every american can take a great deal of pride in the role that have play in bring this about in southeast|asia can rightly judge as responsible southeast|asian do that the progress of the|past|3|years would have be far less likely if not completely impossible if america 's son and other have not make stand in vietnam at johns|hopkins|university about|3|years|ago announce that the|united|states would take part in the great work of develop southeast|asia include the|mekong|valley for all the people of that region determination to help build a well land a well land for man on both side of the present conflict have not diminish in the least indeed the ravage of war think have make more urgent than ever so repeat on behalf of the|united|state again tonight what say at johns|hopkins that north|vietnam could take place in this common effort just as soon as peace come over time a wide framework of peace and security in southeast|asia may become possible the new cooperation of the nation of the area could be a foundation stone certainly friendship with the nation of such a southeast|asia be what the|united|states seek and that be all that the|united|states seek one|day fellow citizen there will be peace in southeast|asia will come because the people of southeast|asia want those whose army be at war tonight and those who though threaten have thus far be spare peace will come because asians be willing to work for and to sacrifice for and to die by the thousand for but let never be forget peace will come also because america send son to help secure have not be easy far from during the|past|4|years have be fate and responsibility to be commander in chief have live daily and nightly â€” with the cost of this war know the pain that have inflict know perhaps well than anyone the misgiving that have arouse throughout this entire long period have be sustain by a single principle that what be do now in vietnam be vital not only to the security of southeast|asia but be vital to the security of every american surely have treaty which must respect surely have commitment that be go to keep resolution of the congress testify to the need to resist aggression in the world and in southeast|asia but the heart of involvement in south|vietnam â€” under different president separate administration have always be america 's own security and the large purpose of involvement have always be to help the nation of southeast|asia become independent and stand alone self sustain as member of a great world community at peace with and at peace with all other with such an asia country and the world will be far more secure than be tonight believe that a peaceful asia be far near to reality because of what america have do in vietnam believe that the man who endure the danger of battle fight there for tonight be help the entire world avoid far great conflict far wide war far more destruction than this one the peace that will bring home someday will come tonight have offer the first in what hope will be a series of mutual move toward peace pray that will not be reject by the leader of north|vietnam pray that will accept as a means by which the sacrifice of own people may be end and ask help and support fellow citizen for this effort to reach across the battlefield toward an early peace finally fellow americans let say this of those to whom much be give much be ask can not say and no man could say that no more will be ask of yet believe that now no less than when the|decade begin this generation of americans be willing to pay any price bear any burden meet any hardship support any friend oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty since those word be speak by john|f.|kennedy the people of america have keep that compact with mankind 's noble cause and shall continue to keep yet believe that must always be mindful of this thing whatever the trial and the test ahead the ultimate strength of country and cause will lie not in powerful weapon or infinite resource or boundless wealth but will lie in the unity of people this believe very deeply throughout entire public career have follow the personal philosophy that be a free man an american a public servant and a member of party in that order always and only for in the service of nation first as a congressman as a senator and as vice president and now as president have put the unity of the people first have put ahead of any divisive partisanship and in these time as

ahead what win when all of people unite just must not now be lose in suspicion distrust selfishness and politic among any of people believe this as do have conclude that should not permit the presidency to become involved in the partisan division that be develop in this|political|year with america 's son in the field far away with america 's future under challenge right here at home with hope and the world 's hope for peace in the balance every day do not believe that should devote an|hour|or|a|day of time to any personal partisan cause or to any duty other than the awesome duty of

some sign from the other side the president peace be the number subject in the mind of every leader in the government be search for a part of every|day think that the people of south|vietnam have demonstrate that want to be govern on the basis of man vote and people who be prepared to live under that kind of an arrangement could live under that kind of arrangement the thing that must recognize about peace be that be much more than just wish for can not get just because want if that be true would have have a long time ago because there be no people in the world who want peace more than the president the cabinet and the people of the|united|state but if be to find the solution of unite the people of south|vietnam and solve the problem in south|vietnam must be do not by some senator or congressman ryan or senator hartke or senator fulbright or some of good intentioned people who want peace this peace be go to be find by the leadership of south|vietnam the people of south|vietnam in south|vietnam be encourage that be go to continue to do dead level best to see this constitutional government where of people register and of people vote develop some kind of a plan that think will ultimately unite south|vietnam and bring peace to that area this will take time this will take patience this will take understanding the great problem have be not mislead the enemy and let think because of some of the statement hear come from that the way be cheap or that be easy or that be go to falter mr scherer mr. president there seem to be a grow impression throughout the world that the|united|states will settle for nothing less than military victory in vietnam what be view on that the president have just explain what think would be a fair solution will repeat as briefly and as succinctly as can the demilitarized zone must be respect as the agreement require the unity of vietnam as a whole must be a matter for peaceful adjustment and negotiation the north|vietnamese force must get out of laos and stop infiltrate laos that be what the agreement require and must be respect the overwhelming majority of the people of south|vietnam want a man vote constitutional government about|70|percent of all the citizen who may have vote in south|vietnam register in the election and of vote the or so of the population now under vietcong control must live under a man vote constitutional system if there be to be peace president thieu have say that the|south|vietnamese|government be not prepared to recognize the nlf as a government and know well that nlf 's control be by hanoi and so do but also have say that be prepare for informal talk with member of the nlf and that these could bring good result think that be a statesmanlike position and hope the other side will respond that be why or statement in early|december say believe that the south|vietnamese must work out own future act through electoral process of the kind carry forward in the|last|2|years the political future of south|vietnam mr. scherer must be work out in south|vietnam by the people of south|vietnam be judgment that this war could be end in a matter of week if the other side would face these simple fact and if some of own people here in this country would encourage that that be do instead of broadcasting alarm that may give false signal both to hanoi and to the vietcong mr rather mr. president be willing to accept communists in a coalition government if the|south|vietnamese|government and the nlf get together to negotiate be willing to accept communists in a coalition government the president think that the thing must bear in mind that what happen in south|vietnam be up to the people of south|vietnam not to north|vietnam not to china the|soviet|union or the|united|state but the people of south|vietnam be prepared to have every man in south|vietnam under constitutional government man vote for those people to determine the kind of government want think know what that determination would be from who be register and the who have vote be a matter for to determine think that may add other thing here when mr. reynolds say what be the minimum condition for this or that do not want to get spar with each other but can say that so far as the|united|state be concern be ready to stop fight tonight if be ready to stop fight but be not ready to stop side of the war only to encourage to escalate side of the war will reciprocate and meet any move that make but be not go to be so softheade and pudde head as to say that will stop half of the war and hope and pray that stop now have try that in some instance have lean over backwards every time have have escalate effort and have kill soldier have get no result from a burn child dread the fire but if want to stop bombing have to ask to stop bombing stop hand grenade stop mortar at san|antonio lay out the formula and say will stop bomb immediately provide will have prompt and productive discussion now that be about as far as anyone can go that be as far as anyone should go that be as far as be go mr scherer mr. president be feeling that have now make proposition and the next move be up to the president well be feeling that position in the world be very clearly know if be not have try to repeat enough tonight that the people can understand mr reynolds mr. president what be assessment of hanoi 's attitude at this point in the war do believe be count sir on defeat next|november the president think that hanoi feel that if can hold out long enough that will not win a military victory against general|westmoreland have not do that can not point to single victory win from marines or from air or from navy or from army think though that can repeat what happen to with the french that if will be strong and continue to remain firm that will develop enough sympathy and understanding in this country and hatred for war in this country that will will outlast will do not think that be true think in due time if people will understand and recognize what be happen think will help prove be not true mr scherer mr. president just to make this abundantly clear what seem to be say here tonight be that peace in vietnam be principally up to the|saigon|government rather than the|united|state and that the|saigon|government can have useful talk with the vietcong without recognize the president yes have say that think the war could be stop in a matter of day if president thieu 's suggestion that informally talk with member of the nlf be carry out and if would agree to what have already agree to in the accord and the accord and the other point that mention this|morning like man vote under the present constitutional government think that would be a useful starting point and think the result could be that could find a way to stop the war mr rather mr. president think what bother some people though be that president thieu and the|south|vietnamese|government as be now constitute say that do not recognize the vietcong do not recognize the nlf how be go to have negotiation with if do not recognize the president could have informal talk with dan say that the president have make clear that would not recognize nlf but have make dear for many many month that view can be hear and can respond to recommendation can be receive and can react to president thieu in a very statesmanlike manner have say that would be agreeable to have informal talk with representative would hope that out of that some understanding could be reach believe if could be reach the war could be bring to a close mr scherer mr. president much have be make of campaign statement about not send american boy to fight in an asian war as look back on that now be that a pledge a hope or be simply a statement of principle in a large context the president well be of many statement if will look back upon as a part of a policy namely policy then and now be to keep hand out for negotiation and for discussion and for peace and guard up that would support the|south|vietnamese to keep from be envelop make clear all through that campaign and in this speech which have extract little single sentence out of that feel that the south|vietnamese ought to pledge every resource have man material all of resource to defend that would never supplant but would supplement to the extent that be necessary do not plan to go into asia and to fight an asian war that asians ought to be fight for but if asians be fight for and be use all the resource that have in south|vietnam there be no pledge no commitment or no implication that would not supplement and support as be do and as agree to do many year before in the|seato|treaty and as have agree to do in the|gulf|of|tonkin resolution before that statement mr rather mr. president if the south--- the president that have just be a part of the politician ' gambit of pick out sentence before get to the but in and say be not go to take over all the fighting and do be not go to do what asian boy in south|vietnam should do be do have over|700,000 man there out of population and be raise another compare to the additional that be send so do not plan to supplant at all but do plan to supplement to whatever be necessary to keep the communist conspiracy from gobble up that nation mr rather mr. president if the south|vietnamese be as dedicated to freedom as say and as many who have be there say why be that do not fight as well motivated or at least seemingly as the vietcong and the communist north|vietnamese to put more bluntly why do not south|vietnamese fight as well as the president do not think that all people do everything alike know some television broadcaster be well than other know some president that can perform in a conversation well than other general abrams who be give leadership to the south|vietnamese people think that army be develop very well now that be not to say that be equal to the good troop of every other nation but have make great improvement be work at job still have some problem to correct in leadership that be what really determine what kind of a fighting force have but be get at and be get result be mighty easy to blame someone else that be what do do not think get much out of blame ally or talk about how much well be than most of the people out there tell that believe that the|south|vietnamese|army at this time be equal to the korean troop in if be do not think will have to apologize too much for be take up position on the dmz now have be give very good result from action general abrams think be do all right would prefer judgment to anybody 's judgment and know mr reynolds mr. president have always credit the russians with a sincere desire for peace in vietnam do still hold to that view if really want peace why do not stop supply the north|vietnamese the president without go into statement as to view would say this be not sure just at this point of all that motivate the chinese or the russians or any of the other communists who be support the|north|vietnamese do not think could honestly tell just what motivation be have always hope that would like to see this war bring to an end that have be indication to whether that would work out in the long run do not know mr scherer mr. president that bring back to glassboro and conversation this|summer how much of factor in the restraint that and the russians seem to show in the middle|east crisis be a product of the dialogue that establish with mr. kosygin at glassboro the president think that the glassboro conference be a very useful conference be not sure that really solve any of the problem of the|middle|east think the situation in the|middle|east be a very dangerous one think have make clear viewpoint in statement of june|19th the condition that ought to enter into bring about peace in that area stress those to mr. kosygin at glassboro understand do not agree with but think that the|soviet|union understand that feel very strongly about this matter that do have definite view think ambassador goldberg at the|united|nation have make position very clear as a result of the action of the|united|nation in send ambassador jar there as a mediator be hopeful that the condition outline on june|19th can be work out and that a permanent solution can be find to that very difficult problem would say be of most dangerous situation and one that be go to require the good tact judgment patience and willingness on the part of all to find a solution mr rather mr. president do consider that this country have the same kind of unwavering commitment to defend israel against invasion as have in south|vietnam the president do not have a|seato|treaty if that be what be ask have make clear very definite interest in israel and desire to preserve peace in that area of the world by many mean but do not have a mutual security treaty with as do in southeast|asia mr reynolds mr. president if may come back for just a moment to the question of relation with the|soviet|union be often say that of the most tragic consequence of the war in south|vietnam be the setback in american soviet relation do agree with that do think be make progress in get along the president well there be a good many thing say mr. reynolds that people have to take with a grain of salt first ought to look at the source of these statement have try to analyze position in the world with other nation do regret that do not see everything alike with the|soviet|union or other nation hope that there would not be this tension and these strain that frequently be in evidence now do not say that everything be all right because have very definite and very strong difference of opinion and philosophy but if be ask if the tension exist today that exist when the|berlin|wall go up the answer be no now can understand the|soviet|union 's inhibition and the problem have as long as vietnam be take place be call upon to support communist brother and be support in a limited way with some equipment wish that be not so would hope that would exercise duty and responsibility as cochairman and take some leadership and try to bring this war to an end but do not think that thing be as tense or as serious or as dangerous as be when the|berlin|wall go up in the cuban missile crisis or follow mr. kennedy 's visit with mr. khrushchev at vienna mr scherer mr. president move now to europe what about the complaint of europe that preoccupation with vietnam have cause united|stat relation with europe to take a back seat the president do not find that complaint in europe find in georgetown among a few columnist generally the european leader be have very frequent exchange with generally prime minister wilson will be here early in february have be here several time have be to germany and mr. kiesinger and ahead of mr. erhard and ahead of mr. adenauer have be here many of the scandinavian leader have come here the dutch leader have come here this|year in europe have have a very long agenda that have produce what think be very excellent result have just conclude an agreement on which involve very far reach trade concession think will stand as a monument to the relationship of the people of europe and the people of the|united|state and very much to both of advantage have a challenge of nato and general de|gaulle ask to get out of france sit down with the other member of nato the other european nation and look at problem decide that would go to belgium of those nation join the|united|state and of go there nato be now intact as solid as can be unify secretary rusk have just return from very successful meeting with so the challenge to nato have be rebuff the difficulty of the kennedy round have be solve the frequent prediction that the germans would reduce troop strength and would bring division back from europe those matter have be work out be work feverishly every day try to bring about a nonproliferation agreement and be make headway so think if take the result of this year 's effort in europe that most european statesman who have be engage in those effort would think have be quite successful and probably more successful than any other period and do not see that have either ignore or neglect mr reynolds mr. president wonder if may turn to matter at home sir the civil right movement in this country be found and thrive on the principle of nonviolence now all that seem to be change there be people openly advocate violence have violence last|summer what be explanation for these riot sir what happen the president would say that not all of be change would say that all through history as these change occur there have be violence connect with find that true in world|war|i. find that true in world|war|ii have a riot in detroit during president roosevelt 's administration where have to send out troop that compare very much to the same one have there this|year have this unrest have this uncertainty have this desire of people who have be hold down all these|year to rise up and try to acquire quickly what have be deny so unjustly so long have more violence than want and more than should have more than be go to be able to tolerate but do not think that represent all the country at all think that represent a very small minority think big problem be to get at the cause of these riot think that some of the cause be the hope of the people do not have job want job so be go to have to provide job there be unemployed hard core unemployed in principal city just have to go and find job for be go to call in the businessman of america and say of thing have to happen have to help go out here and find job for these people or be go to have to find job in the government for and offer every of a job think that be thing that could be do think that will have to be do as expensive as be think will have to do something about the housing situation people live in filth in dilapidate house more new housing ought to be build and have to be build have to find place to build that housing have try to pass legislation that think would be helpful such as the open housing bill have try to encourage the congress to take action on model city and on rent supplement have make progress although not as much as would like so be go to have to accelerate and step up rebuild city so can have decent housing in the field of education education have be deny to the poor on an equal basis for many|years the poor child have not have the advantage because of lack of transportation because of the economic situation in family because of a lot of reason own health condition so have not have the education and because of discrimination have not have the educational opportunity that the other child have have so be fast correct those have triple education program in and the poor have be the primary beneficiary be spend time as much on health today as be and the poor be the primary beneficiary of medicare and medicaid can have hospital bill pay now can have doctor pay now as a result infant mortality rate be go down as a result death rate be go down have make great progress with health and education be important thing so would say job health education and housing be all contribute to this general dissatisfaction that result in violence on occasion and have to accelerate effort there have to appeal to these people to keep feeling within bound and keep lawful because every person in this country must obey the law of this country and there be no situation that justify violate the law mr rather mr. president for those americans especially negroes who live in crowded area live in poverty with no education no job and seemingly no help why not follow an extremist why not revolt the president tell the reason why because revolting and violence be unlawful be not go to be allow do not solve the problem be not the answer to the condition that exist the answer be job the answer be education the answer be health now if refuse to give those answer people be go to lose hope and when do be pretty difficult to get to be as reasonable as think should be but there be every reason why should not violence be not go to produce more job violence be not go to produce more education violate the law and take the law into own hand be not go to produce well health or well housing be go to produce anarchy and that can not be tolerate mr rather some of these extremist mr. president say though that anarchy be exactly what need that want to tear down the fabric of this society the president do not agree with the extremist and hope do not mr scherer mr. president what be administration do now to see that do not have another riot this|summer the president have outline that job housing education health all of these thing try to get at these problem think that if can have a program for the city like model city think if can have job like neighborhood youth training and the job program be work out if can find employment for all the hard core think that this will answer some of the cause of the riot mr reynolds mr. president in the ghetto think say that be just talk white man 's talk what be reaction to that the president know what reaction to be mr reynolds be not there this sense of despair this grow estrangement between white and nonwhite the president what be answer to frank mr reynolds well would hope that do not know that answer be necessarily the one sir that want the president what be answer though frank mr reynolds answer be that be not talk and that there will be an attempt make but can come in time be think of these young-- the president if not what what be solution what do recommend mr reynolds what do think should do sir the president be not go to answer now be not go to give recommendation or thought mr reynolds recommendation be to get go as fast as possibly can on all the program that have just mention the president that be what be do accept recommendation and will carry out mr reynolds thank sir mr scherer mr. president if this situation be as serious as all think be people say be spend a year in vietnam and why can not spend a year at home if can not get program such as be talk about through in this congress how will get through in the future how do get a sense of urgency about the president hope that the congress will as these thing develop see the need of think have make progress could not get the model city program authorize and fund but do this|year could not get rent supplement authorize and fund but have this|year could not get the housing program that have underway now authorize and fund but have this|year be make progress can not correct overnight can not take the error of and solve in would like to do as much as can be recommend a good deal more than the congress be willing to do in the poverty field recommend and urge and ask every cabinet member to join in do so urge the congress to provide in fund for poverty cut several|hundred|million|dollar have make recommendation for rent supplement unit cut to regret if could issue an executive order and vitiate and put nay own program into effect would do but be move in that direction and be go to do all can to accelerate and to escalate mr rather mr. president if may let turn to the subject of youth think everyone expect youth to rebel and to be restless but there seem to be an unusually large number of american youth at this particular point in history who feel alienated to the traditional american idea of god patriotism and family do sense this alienation what can be do about the president yes sense think have that condition and be try to meet as best know how have see several time in lifetime remember the day of the zoot suiter in world|war|ii remember the doubter who think all of youth be go to the dog because of the sit down movement in some of the plant in country at certain period of country remember the doubt express about ability in world|war|ii to take a bunch of beardless boy and resist hitler 's legion there have be some disappointment but have visit the campus of this country cabinet have go and meet with the young people of this country deal with young folk every day in the|peace|corp in the poverty program in the vista program and in the job camp and think be a very small percentage that have give up who have lose faith who have deep question about the future of the country and of have more|than|3|million young people serve in uniform hear from about|100 of every|day do not get the attention that television people give these exhibitionist do not have anyone to make sign for and parade get picture in the paper be just there from daylight to dark fight for freedom and liberty and willing to die for be a pretty large number comparatively speak doubt that there be anything like that many hippie or doubt that there be that many disillusioned people if add all up and put in unit think that would make a very small percentage and think anyone who think the youth of the country be go to the dog or imply better take another look at have just go through wedding this|year and have be associate with a lot of young people and the kind of young people see whom hear who write be not the little group that all can ferret out up here at some park or some place that have nothing to do but carry a sign around on shoulder and try to obstruct someone else from get to a place or try to howl down after get there think have young people who be terribly upset at what be go on know hate war all hate war but think there be a very small percent who be go to take these extreme mean and go to employ these extreme way to express this lack of confidence in future and in country mr scherer mr. president how much of an inhibition do give as go about the country to have to face these dissenter and demonstrator do feel can go where want to go the president yes and do mr scherer do think that will be true all through next|year the president yes think there have be a very subtle effort make by a few politician to suggest that would be difficult for the president to travel would be very dangerous probably the wish be father to the thought think there have be some indication that certain organized group would try to bring embarrassment to the secretary of state by not let talk or to the vice president by interrupt talk but every time that have happen and have be encourage some by some of the political group because have follow and have see that that have happen the people have be resound in disapproval while all recognize dissent and expect and treat respectfully listen to do not think that dissent should be turn into hooliganism and do not think because a person have a right to dissent that as a great justice time say have a right to holier fire in a crowded theater or that have the right to tear a speaker 's necktie off or to put hand over mouth and prevent from speak think the dissent should be within the law and within the constitution respect when be but if be go to use storm trooper tactic will be deal with and will be deal with properly if be go to encourage folk to bring bodily harm to a president or to any other official that be sink very low and do not think the people want to hear much like that either over the television in the form of suggestion or by some who be send to these campus to incite folk mr reynolds mr. president who be these people who be encourage this sort of thing do see an element of subversion in the president see on every campus on television every|night be representative of various group do not want to get personal and do not want to give advertisement but if be interested just turn on abc tonight and look at the newscast a good part of every newscast have will have some of these folk who be encourage the dissent appeal to will be parade will have sign will be charge with murder and this and that because be try to carry out obligation and treaty commitment and protect that flag mr reynolds feel sir apparently that the press the television radio the whole work give a disproportionate share of attention to this the president no do not say that say report and if want to see be there for to see do not say anything about disproportionate mr reynolds do think do sir the president well think that be a matter for judgment do not think be up to the president to be make up newscast mr rather mr. president have say think mr. president that welcome responsible dissent for those americans who do strongly dissent from war policy but who want to be responsible and yet want to be effective what can recommend what can do the president well in the first place be not in the business of recommend program for have enough problem with own program but do have a way of people in this country express viewpoint give out interview make speech have picketing would say generally speak mr. rather be lawful abide by the law of the land do whatever the law will permit to do do not think have to be a law violator in the name of the first amendment do not think be justified in be a law violator in order to have right of free speech think that the people who ought to want to follow the law and the constitution the most be the dissenter because be that law and that constitution which give right to dissent and protect that right be amazed that some of these so call liberal folk who reserve for the right to speak long loud and freely but when the opposition view be express try to drown out with catcall egg or tomato do not understand that kind of behavior mr rather some of these dissenter say that the only way can get attention be to do something unlawful the president be not familiar with that who say that mr rather there be mr. dellinger for who lead the march on the pentagon who say there be no way to get the attention of the establishment that is the government the president do not think that be correct at all read the paper see the television read correspondence spend a good deal more time on that than do out view what be say or do at the pentagon mr scherer mr. president will soon be upon be wonder as sit here in rock chair whether could tell when sit down to make decision about run again what be the factor be go to weigh the president have not do that ray think in due time will cross that bridge until then do not want to speculate about mr scherer not even the factor the president until do that be not go to speculate about mr reynolds mr. president often say that the president have plenty of advice regardless of when intend to leave this office and know be not go to tell that what advice would give to the man who do succeed the president well will do that when leave mr rather mr. president know that with the campaign come up do not want to get into politic too much but would be remiss in duty as a reporter if do not ask regardless of who the democratic candidate be in what effect do think the candidacy of senator mccarthy and the position of senator robert|kennedy will have on the president just do not know do not know what the effect of the kennedy mccarthy movement be have in the country be not a reporter have not follow be not privileged to all the conversation that may have take place just observe have have some meeting and some discussion do know of the interest of both of in the presidency and the ambition of both of see that reflect from time to time but just what be prepared to do how be go to do whether be go to do in concert or what will be the effect upon the american people of these maneuvering be not prepared to say mr rather mr. president french president de|gaulle in light of picking at nato attack on the dollar and now even training of russian troop do consider a friend or an enemy of this country the president believe that the french people have an understanding an interest and affection for the american people and think be greatly reciprocate be sorry that the relationship between the president and mr. de|gaulle be not a close one and that do not see matter alike any more often than do have try to do everything that know to do to minimize the difference that exist in the leadership of the government strongly feel that the people of the country have a long history of friendship and be determined to preserve that be also determined to minimize difference and from part to do nothing to unjustly or unduly provoke the|french|government mr rather to get precisely to the point about general de|gaulle as apart from the french people-- the president get precisely to the point do not want to do anything to accentuate aggravate or contribute to emphasize the difference that have and strain the relation think basically people be friendly and be go to do all can to keep friendly mr scherer mr. president the other day of the eld statesman in business give as view that unless regain the trust of the people think that be the way put could not effectively govern how do that proposition strike the president think must have the trust of the people feel do have the trust of the people do think have the support of the people the people in every election have have a chance to express in a national election and have give a majority vote in the last election get of the vote the high percentage any president ever obtain be not talk about some individual poll in the last congressional election have a majority in both house and senate now lose some of majority lose some of support do not think there be any question about that in will always do that look ahead of when be have the san|francisco convention think a great many people toy with the idea of join or voting in the opposition party until have the result of the convention until see what would happen if elect a republican and who would be bring into office the kind of government would have and the kind of policy would have think there be some uncertainty in the country think there be some division in the country do not think that the opposition be in the majority and do not think will be on election|day but do not discount and do not ignore mr scherer as look ahead to the world that grandson be go to grow up in what kind of a world would like that to be the president would hope that would be a more knowledgeable world and a better educated world there be people out of every today who can not read cat who can not spell dog who can not recognize the print word mother would like to see every boy and girl who be bear in the world have all the education that or can take be make great gain in that direction in this country would like to see other nation make great gain would like to see an enlightened program of family planning available to all the people of the world would like to see the problem of food production face up to and nation take the necessary step to try to provide the food that be go to need to support population would like to see the miracle of health extend to all the people of the world as be to the fellow who be operate on with the heart change the|other|day know that the infant mortality rate be go down should like to see reflect in all the nation in short believe that ancient enemy be ignorance and illiteracy be disease and bigotry would like to see descendant grow up in a world that be as educate as possible as healthy as science will permit as prepare to feed and which certainly have sufficient conservation force to permit enjoyable leisure for the people who work long and late and think be move to that end mr rather mr. president what do expert tell and what be good estimate on the performance of the economy over the|next|few|month consider that do not get the tax increase that once call absolutely essential to the health of the economy the president be very hard to predict what be ahead the secretary of the treasury and the|council|of|economic|adviser and the budget director have make the good statement that could to the|ways|and|means|committee think the business activity be go to pick up think there be go to be increase production think be very essential that have a tax bill look forward to continued prosperity have have of unparalleled prosperity in this country long than any other period uninterrupted and want to keep thing that way think the most important thing to from a domestic standpoint be to provide more job and have add six|million job in the|last|few|year think that those job ought to have good pay but that should not increase wage or profit or dividend beyond what the increase productivity justifie so that can maintain some restraint on price and while be not satisfied with the job have do have do a well job than any other country and be urge both business and labor to take that into consideration in negotiation with each other mr scherer mr. president what about china many people as peer off into the midst of the future see future problem with china if could sit down with the ruler of china what would tell about america 's intention toward the president have say to in several public statement that hope that can conduct in such a way as will permit to join the family of nation and that can learn to live in harmony with each other have no desire to be enemy of any nation in the world believe that be possible over the|year for to develop a well understanding of the world in which live think there be some very important thing take place right in china today that will contribute to hope a well understanding and a more moderate approach to neighbor in the world have observe failure in africa and in latin|america and in southeast|asia where have undertake aggressive step that have result in failure for and hope will profit by these experience believe will do not know all that would like to know about what be go on in china be a rather closed society and do not have all the information that would like to have but be hopeful and believe that over a period of time that the opportunity exist for to gain a well understanding of the other people of the world and thus be able to live more harmoniously with mr reynolds mr. president there be quite a dust up in this town recently perhaps more here than elsewhere about the resignation of secretary mcnamara be there anything more can tell about the president no can only repeat what secretary mcnamara say and what have say secretary mcnamara have be secretary of defense longer than any other man think have be the good secretary of defense that have ever have hate to see leave as secretary of defense take great satisfaction in the contribution that mr. mcnamara have make to the government be only on sabbatical leave be not go to be very far away from here and on anything that be remotely connected with the good interest of the world that the|world|bank be interested in will be work very close together do not consider that have lose service or the world have lose talent or that have lose a friend in any way think that instead of build a great machine at the pentagon for the purpose of defend liberty and freedom that will be busy at the|world|bank in the constructive purpose of build the economy and better humanity in these very nation that be try to defend and take forward with a great deal of pleasure to work very closely with mr rather mr. president look ahead to next|year this will be the|final|year of this term of presidency what be priority particularly in regard to congress can get through do feel any more of program any more welfare program the president will have detailed recommendation in state of the union in connection with the problem the nation face there be many unresolved problem there will be substantial recommendation to the next congress there have be substantial achievement in this one do not get everything want at all never have but have a good congress do not have as good a congress as have in the 89th congress do not pass as many substantive measure and do not reach as far as the other be curtail some because that be the mood of the congress and on a good many measure be able to reduce proposal do not destroy model city cripple cut by several|hundred|million do not destroy rent supplement but cut from do not destroy the rat bill knock out for a while and stagger but after the senate work on approve do not recommit a good many of the bill but reduce do not wipe out poverty but reduce from several|hundred|million to something so those be the thing that have to face up to be not say ugly thing about the individual those man think be right do not want to take some of these new program do not want to fund model city rent supplement or face up to the urban requirement and what think be requirement and understand philosophy have understand for frequently be the preserver of stagnation and want to keep thing as be do not want to move forward now come into the executive branch with a man who say let get the country move again now have the country move again and want to keep move be go to keep move if can get the congress support and while do not get to support every time want to do move forward and hope the next session will be a productive one too be go to appeal to every republican in to come in and do what be good for country and if do that without regard to how may cripple the president without regard to the politic of the|year then think will have a good congress be go to do what think be good for country at home and abroad without regard to what effect have on future and if will do the same thing will have a good government a good country and then can let the election take care of and think will have a good election thank mr. president & nbsp & nbsp view transcript transcript the president good|morning lady and gentleman will be glad to take question q. do think that at this point force level in vietnam will begin to level off in authorized strength or do think more troop may be need in the future the president have previously consider and approve the recommendation of the|joint|chiefs|of|staff for the force level general westmoreland discuss this at some length with last|night and this morning anticipate no increase in that level q. mr. president be get close to the end of 4th year in office have be subject to a great deal of personal criticism range from a senator in own party planning to run-- the president be generally familiar with that q. the preacher in williamsburg wonder how appraise this personally the president be not a surprise be aware that this have happen to the president who precede no public official certainly not who have be in public life 35|year as have be would fail to expect criticism there be a different type of criticism there be a difference between constructive dissent and storm trooper bullying howling and take the law into own hand think that the president must expect that those in the other party will frequently find necessary to find fault and to complain to attempt to picture to the people that the president should be replace be also true in all party that there be division do not all think alike if do man would be do all the thinking so have division in party have perhaps more than share sometimes but be sure the republicans think that too when get into a|political|year with the help and advice and the abetting that the press can do and the assistance that the oppose party can do because be to interest to try to destroy in order to have a place for and take the division in own party and concentrate then do seem to mount up and at time occupy a great deal of public attention but do not think be unusual for a president to be criticize that seem to be of the thing that go with the job not many of want to say fail or make a mistake or should not have do that or this should not have happen be always easy to say that someone over there be wrong the president be more or less a lightning rod at least have see that in this country remember to take or illustration when president truman very courageously and think very wisely go into korea of pollster dash out with a poll dr gallup and find that that position be approve by about|81|percent six|months|later when the sacrifice be evident and the problem begin to appear the same pollster talk to the same people find that this have drop from 81|to|26|percent now those thing have happen in all of crisis economic domestic and international a president learn to expect and learn to live with the important thing for every man who occupy this place be to search as best can to get the right answer to try to find out what be right and then do without regard to poll and without regard to criticism q. mr. president a good many americans have say that a stop to the bombing be worth try just to see if north|vietnam will respond what be view on this the president north|vietnam have respond statement this|week in the hanoi newspaper in response to statement from the enterprise be very clear and very compelling should answer any person in this country who have ever feel that stop the bombing alone would bring to the negotiating table hanoi make very clear in response to appeal from the enterprise that position in effect be the same as have always be be the same as enunciate in ho|chi|minh 's letter to which ho|chi|minh make public there be some hopeful people and there be some naive people in this country and there be some political people but anyone who really want to know what the position of north|vietnam be should read what the spokesman of north|vietnam say that be best summarize in mr. ho|chi|minh 's letter to the president that make public that be on the record that have never change so all of these hope dream and idealistic people go around be misleading and confusing and weaken position q. do have any evidence that the vietcong may be move toward the position of want to negotiate separate from hanoi and if so what would be attitude toward negotiate with the president would prefer to handle negotiation through diplomatic channel with whomsoever may negotiate do not think this be the place to do negotiating be very anxious to find a solution that will bring an end to the war as have state so many time be ready to meet and discuss that with the official of hanoi and the vietcong will have no problem in have voice fully hear and consider but think that would be well if would wait until opportunity develop along that line and then do through train diplomat q. mr. president a|minute ago talk about the job of be president this wednesday be go to complete 4|year in the|office|of|the|president wonder if could reflect for a moment on the presidency and what have be great satisfaction and what be great disappointment the president well think have well do that a little later can not tell all the good thing that have happen or the bad one either in these|4|year in a 30-minute press conference would be charge with filibustering but primarily want to think of the future and not the past have be almost century since revolution and since win freedom have come a long way during that period but have much farth to go as can see from education and health and city statistic and farm statistic as long as there be people out of every in the world who can not spell cat or can not write dog have much to do be particularly proud of what have do in education from head start to adult education where man and woman past be learn to read and write for the first time be very pleased for instance that have raise contribution from the|federal|government to high education from to in the|last|4|years while the states have remain practically static have make revolutionary stride in education in health in conservation where be probably take in as much land in the public domain for the first time in year as be let out feel that have bring a degree of stability into international relation to this hemisphere through the|alliance|for|progress and meeting at punta|del|este work with other nation have make material advance in help underdeveloped nation in africa be very pleased with what have come out of meeting with the germans and with the british in connection with trilateral talk what have come out of kennedy round meeting the several treaty that have negotiate with the|soviet|union and the one that be work on so hard now the nonproliferation treaty be happy that more people have good pay job today than have when come into this office but these be thing of the past and should accept be here want to preserve but the important problem be ahead what be the|next|century go to be like what be the|third|century go to be like as long as the ancient enemy be rampant in the world illiteracy ignorance disease poverty and war there be much for government to do be work on that now will be talk more to about that in the|months|ahead q. mr. president in view of talk this|week with general|westmoreland ambassador bunker and other what be present assessment of progress and prospect in vietnam the president well will repeat to assessment because be the one who be in the good position to judge thing locally will give evaluation of what have say first think every american 's heart should swell with pride at the competence and capacity of leadership in vietnam believe and allied people believe that have a superior leadership think be the good that the|united|states|of|america can produce in experience in judgment in training in general competence have have meeting with ambassador bunker and with general|westmoreland have coffee with at length this|morning just before come here american people when get in a contest of any kind whether be in a war an election a football game or whatever be want decide and decide quickly get in or get out like that curve to rise like this indicate a sharp rise and like the opposition to go down like this indicate a sharply decline line]. that be not the kind of war be fight in vietnam make statement to the world of what would do if have communist aggression in that part of the world in say would stand with those people in the face of common danger the time come when have to put up or shut up put up and be there do not march out and have a big battle each|day in a guerrilla war be a new kind of war for so do not move that fast summarize and try to be fully responsive to question in the time allot be move more like this indicate gradual be move more like this indicate decline instead of straight up and straight down be make progress be pleased with the result that be get be inflict great loss than be take amidst the horror of war and more people have be kill try to vote in south|vietnam than have be kill by bomb in north|vietnam accord to the north|vietnam figure in the midst of all the horror of war in guerrilla fight in south|vietnam have have election in a period of a|little|over|14|month there be great doubt whether could have any take from to but to get a constitution with anglo saxon background and all the training have to think that here in the midst of war when the grenade be pop like firecracker all around that third or fourth of the people would register and vote and have election in and through the democratic process select people at the local level a constituent assembly a house of representative a senate a president and a vice president that be encouraging the fact that the population under free control have constantly rise and that under communist control have constantly go down be a very encouraging sign the improvement that have be make by the south|vietnamese in put in reform in announce other program and in improve own army be a matter of great satisfaction to ambassador bunker and to general|westmoreland have a lot to do yet a great many mistake have be make take step forward and slip back be not all perfect by any mean there be a good many|day when get a c minus instead of an a plus but overall be make progress be satisfied with that progress ally be pleased with that progress every country that know in that area that be familiar with what be happen think be absolutely essential that uncle|sam keep word and stay there until can find an honorable peace if have any doubt about mr. ho|chi|minh who read paper and who listen to radio who look at television if have any doubt about want to disillusion this|morning keep commitment people be go to support the man who be there the man there be go to bring an honorable peace q. mr. president hanoi may be interpret current public opinion poll to indicate that will be replace next|year how should this affect the campaign in this country the president do not know how will affect the campaign in this country whatever interpretation hanoi may make that would lead to believe that uncle|sam whoever may be president be go to pull out and will be easy for to make an inside deal with another president then will make a serious misjudgment q. be go to run next|year the president will cross that bridge when get to as have tell so many time q. mr. president there be increase statement from capitol|hill that say tax bill be dead for this session of congress be there any plan on the part of administration to try and revive this before congress leave and secondly if not what plan may have next|year to avert this inflationary trend that be tell will be come the president want very much to have a tax bill just as quickly as can get think the sound prudent fiscal policy require be go to do everything that the president and the administration can do to get that tax bill would be less than frank if do not tell that have no indication whatever that mr. mills or mr. byrnes or the|ways|and|means|committee be likely to report a tax bill before adjourn feel that of failure in the administration have be inability to convince the congress of the wisdom of fiscal responsibility and the necessity of pass a tax bill not only for the effect will have on the inflationary development but the effect will have on the huge deficit that be run think of the great mistake that the congress will make be that mr. ford and mr. mills have take this position that can not have any tax bill now will live to rue the|day when make that decision because be a dangerous decision be an unwise decision think that the people of america none of whom want to pay taxis any pollster can walk out and say do want to pay more tax of course will say no do not want to pay tax but if ask do want inflation do want price to increase or do want a deficit of or do want to spend more than be take in think the average citizen would say no here at the height of prosperity when gross national product be go to run at when look at the precedent of what have do in past war in korea when president truman ask for a tax increase people support this request have be before the congress since last|january have finish most of the appropriation bill read the story this|morning look like out of will roughly cut a|billion|dollars in expenditure but will cut several|billion from revenue because of inaction because people do not like to stand up and do the unpopular thing of assume responsibility that man in public life be require to do sometime know do not add to poll and popularity to say have to have additional taxis to fight this war abroad and fight the problem in city at home but can do with the gross national product have should do and think when the american people and the congress get the full story will do have fail up to now to be able to convince but be go to continue to try in every way that be proper q. senator mccarthy have say be consider oppose in the presidential primary because believe would be a healthy thing to debate vietnam in the primary for the party and for the country too do agree with what effect do think this would have on own candidacy the president do not know how be go to be after all this opposition develop so far as state of health be concern but be very healthy today do not know whether this criticism have contribute to good health or not do not know what senator mccarthy be go to do be not sure that know what plan to do think have well just wait and see until there be something definite there and meet when be necessary q. why do think there be so much confusion frustration and difference of opinion in this country about the war in vietnam the president there have always be confusion frustration and difference of opinion when there be a war go on there be in the|revolutionary|war when only|about|a|third of the people think that be a wise move a|third of oppose and a third be on the sideline that be true when all of new|england come down to secede in madison 's administration in the|war|of|1812 and stop in baltimore do not quite make because andrew|jackson 's result in new|orleans come in be have a party there that night the|next|morn come and tell the president want to congratulate that have think be right all along although have come from boston to baltimore in a secessionist move that be true in the|mexican|war when the congress overwhelmingly vote to go in and later pass a resolution that have grave doubt about some of the most bitter speech be make be so bitter could not be publish have m hold up publication of for do not have to remind of what happen in the|civil|war people be here in the|white|house beg lincoln to concede and work out a deal with the confederacy when word come to of victory tell that pennsylvania be go that illinois have no chance those pressure come to a president know what president roosevelt go through and president wilson in world|war|i. have some senator from certain area then that give very serious problem until victory be assure now when look back upon there be very few people who would think that wilson roosevelt or truman be in error be go to have this criticism be go to have these difference no one like war all people love peace but can not have freedom without defend q. mr. president the foreign aid authorization have be cut back nearly|a|third from what request what be the impact of this economy the president at a time when the rich nation in the world be enjoy more prosperity than have ever have before when carefully tailor request to the very minimum that think be essential the low request that have have in year and then congress cut think be a mistake be a serious mistake when consider that that be attempt to save there out of the that will produce ought to reconsider that decision because what be do with that money not only can give great help to underdeveloped nation but that in can prevent the thing that cause war where be require to spend billion to win would rather have a little preventive medicine every dollar that spend in foreign assistance try to help poor people help be money well spend do not think overdo do not think go too far but think the congress have in the reduction have make again be popular to go back home and say look what do for cut out all these foreign expenditure but when the trouble develop the people who be starve the people who be ignorant illiterate and disease and war spring up and have to go in will spend much more than would if have take an ounce of prevention q. mr. president some people on the air and in print accuse of try to label all criticism of vietnam policy as unpatriotic could tell whether have guideline in which be enable to separate conscientious dissent from irresponsible dissension the president no have not call anyone unpatriotic have not say anything that would indicate that think the wicked fleeth when no one pursueth sometimes do think that some people be irresponsible make untrue statement and ought to be cautious and careful when be deal with the problem involve man at the front there be a great deal of difference as say a moment ago between criticism indifference and responsible dissent all of which insist on and all of which protect and storm trooper bullying throw down in the road smash window rowdyism and every time a person attempt to speak to try to drown out believe very strongly in preserve the right to differ in this country and the right to dissent if have do a good job of anything since have be president be to insure that there be plenty of dissenter there be not a person in this press corps that can not write what want to write most of do write what want to say want advisedly want to protect that congress want to protect but if by chance should say now be not sure that see all the cable on this and be exactly right let explain the other side of would hope that would not say be lambaste critic or that be assail someone what be try to do be to preserve right to give the other side do not think side ought to dominate the whole picture so what would say be let realize that be in the midst of a war let realize that there be of boy out there who be risk life to win that war let ask what be can do to help if think can make a contribution and help by express opinion and dissenting then do but then if the secretary of state start to explain viewpoint do not send out instruction all over the country and say when start to talk and say mr. chair man stamp foot when come to the end of a sentence all of do this and at the third sentence all of boo be amazed that the press in this country who insist on the right to live by the first amendment and to be protect by do not insist that these storm trooper tactic live by the first amendment too and that be wipe out think the time have come when would be good for all of to take a new fresh look at dissent welcome responsible dissent but there be a great deal of difference between responsible dissent and some of the thing that be take place in this country which consider to be extremely dangerous to national interest and consider not very helpful to the man who be fight the war for now everyone must make that judgment for have never say anyone be unpatriotic do not question these people 's motif do question judgment can not say that this dissent have contribute much to any victory have have can not say that these various proposal that range from a senator to a county commissioner to a mayor of a city have really change general|westmoreland 's plan much or ambassador bunker 's approach the paper be fill with every day so think have to consider for what think be worth and make own judgment that be the theory of the first amendment do not stop the publication of any paper do not fine anyone for something say just appeal to to remember that do not have the privilege at the moment of be out there fight please count to before say something that hurt instead of help know that most people 's intention be good do not question motif have never say be unpatriotic although say some pretty ugly thing about people who live in glass house should not be too anxious to throw stone q. mr. president be aim in vietnam to win the war or to seek a compromise negotiate solution the president think aim in vietnam have be very clear from the beginning be consistent with the|seato|treaty with the|atlantic|charter and with the many many statement that have make to the congress in connection with the|tonkin|gulf|resolution the secretary of state have make this clear dozens|and|dozen of time and make enough that think even all the preacher in the country have hear about that is namely to protect the security of the|united|state think the security of the|united|state be definitely tie in with the security of southeast|asia secondly to resist aggression when be a party to a treaty that say will do then carry out think if see a little child in this room who be try to waddle across the floor and some big bully come along and grab by the hair and start stomp think would do something about think that think make a mistake when see hitler move across the landscape of europe the concession that be make by the man carry umbrella at that time think in retrospect think that be a mistake so as a consequence in under the leadership of president eisenhower and secretary dulles have a|seato|treaty be debate be consider and be go into very thoroughly by the senate the man who present that treaty then say this be dangerous the time may come when may have to put up or shut up but ought to serve notice in asia now as refuse to serve notice in europe a|few|years|ago that will resist aggression that will stand against someone who seek to gobble up little country if those little country call upon for help so do that do not vote for that treaty be in the hospital senator kennedy do not vote for the late president be in the hospital senator dirksen do not vote for but senator do vote for know what be in that treaty the time come when have to decide whether mean what say when say security be tie in to security and that would stand in unison in the face of common danger now be do that be do against whoever combine out there to promote aggression be go to do whatever think be necessary to protect the security of south|vietnam and let those people determine for what kind of a government have think be move along very quickly in that direction to develop a democratic procedure third be go to do whatever be necessary to do to see that the aggressor do not succeed those be purpose those be goal be go to get a lot of advice to do this or to do that be go to consider all but for year west point have be turn out the good military man produce anywhere in the world for year have have in foreign|service train and specialized people have in capital today the good brain can select under constitutional arrangement the president must look to secretary of state to foreign policy to ambassadors to the cable and view that express to leader like the|joint|chiefs|of|staff and to general|westmoreland and other and carefully consider everything say and then do what think be right that be not always go to please a county commissioner or a mayor or a member of a legislature never have in any war have ever be in be a favorite of the senate the leader on the military committee and the leader in other post have frequently oppose champ clark the speaker of the house oppose the draft in woodrow|wilson 's administration the chairman of the|foreign|relations|committee with the exception of senator vandenberg almost invariably have find a great deal wrong with the executive in the field of foreign policy there be a division there and there be some frustration there those man express and have a right to have a duty to do but be also the president 's duty to look and see what substance have present how much think out what information have how much knowledge have receive from general|westmoreland or ambassador bunker whoever be how familiar be with what be go on and whether really think ought to follow judgment or follow the judgment of the other people do that every|day some|day have to say to people let try this plan that senator x have suggest and do be do that with the united|nation resolution have try several time to get the|united|nation to play a part in try to bring peace in vietnam the senate think that this be the way to do more|than|50 of have sign a resolution the|senate|foreign|relations|committee have a|big|day|yesterday report resolution in have view have view about really what those resolution will achieve but also have an obligation to seriously and carefully consider the judgment of the other branch of the government and be go to do even though may have some doubt about what will be accomplish that think may be accomplish if be a close question will bend to try to meet view because think that be important have already try the|united|nation before but may try again because have hope and believe that this be the answer will do everything that can to make the answer do not want to hurt chance by give any prediction at this moment will consider the view that everyone suggest thank mr. president & nbsp & nbsp view transcript transcript speaker barnes governor hughes governor smith congressman kazen representative graham most distinguished legislator lady and gentleman deeply appreciate this opportunity to appear before an organization whose member contribute every|day such important work to the public affair of state and of country this evening come here to speak to about vietnam do not have to tell that people be profoundly concerned about that struggle there be passionate conviction about the wise course for nation to follow there be many sincere and patriotic americans who harbor doubt about sustain the commitment that president and a|half|a|million of young man have make doubt and debate be enlarge because the problem of vietnam be quite complex be a mixture of political turmoil of poverty of religious and factional strife of ancient servitude and modern longing for freedom vietnam be all of these thing vietnam be also the scene of a powerful aggression that be spur by an appetite for conquest be the arena where communist expansionism be most aggressively at work in the world today where be cross international frontier in violation of international agreement where be kill and kidnaping where be ruthlessly attempt to bend free people to will into this mixture of subversion and war of terror and hope america have enter with material power and with moral commitment why why should president and the elect representative of people have choose to defend this asian nation more|than|10,000|mile from american shore cherish freedom yes cherish self determination for all people yes abhor the political murder of any state by another and the bodily murder of any people by gangster of whatever ideology and for since the|day of lend lease â€” have seek to strengthen free people against domination by aggressive foreign power but the key to all that have do be really own security at time of crisis before ask americans to fight and die to resist aggression in a foreign land every american president have finally have to answer this question be the aggression a threat â€” not only to the immediate victim but to the|united|states|of|america and to the peace and security of the entire world of which in america be a very vital part that be the question which dwight|eisenhower and john|kennedy and lyndon|johnson have to answer in face the issue in vietnam that be the question that the senate of the|united|state answer by a vote of when ratify and approve the seato treaty in and to which the member of the|united|states|congress respond in a resolution that pass in by a vote of to the|united|state be therefore prepare as the president determine to take all necessary step include the use of armed force to assist any member or protocol state of the|southeast|asia|collective|defense|treaty request assistance in defense of freedom those who tell now that should abandon commitment that secure south|vietnam from armed domination be not worth the price be pay â€” must also answer this question and the test must meet be this what would be the consequence of let armed aggression against south|vietnam succeed what would follow in the time ahead what kind of world be prepared to live in from tonight for those who have bear the responsibility for decision during these|past|m|years the stake to have seem clear and have seem high president dwight|eisenhower say in strategically south vietnam 's capture by the communists would bring power several|hundred|mil into a hitherto free region the remain country in southeast|asia would be menace by a great flanking movement the freedom of people would be lose immediately and that of in adjacent land would be seriously endanger the loss of south|vietnam would set in motion a crumble process that could as progress have grave consequence for and for freedom and president john|f.|kennedy say in withdrawal in the case of vietnam and the case of thailand may mean a cob lapse of the entire area a|year|later reaffirm that be not go to withdraw from that effort in opinion for to withdraw from that effort would mean a collapse not only of south|vietnam but southeast|asia so be go to stay there say president kennedy this be not simply an american viewpoint would have legislative leader know be go to call the roll now of those who live in that part of the world in the great arc of asian and pacific nation and who bear the responsibility for lead people and the responsibility for the fate of people the president of the philippines have this to say vietnam be the focus of attention now may happen to thailand or the philippines or anywhere wherever there be misery disease ignorance for to renounce position of leadership in asia be to allow the red chinese to gobble up all of asia the foreign minister of thailand say the american decision will go down in history as the move that prevent the world from have to face another major conflagration the prime minister of australia say be there because while communist aggression persist the whole of southeast|asia be threaten president park of korea say for the first time in history decide to dispatch combat troop overseas because in belief any aggression against the|republic|of|vietnam represent a direct and grave menace against the security and peace of free asia and therefore directly jeopardize the very security and freedom of own people the prime minister of malaysia warn people that if the|united|states pull out of south|vietnam would go to the communists and after that would be only a matter of time until move against neighboring state the prime minister of new|zealand say can thank god that america at least regard aggression in asia with the same concern as regard aggression in europe â€” and be prepared to back up concern with action the prime minister of singapore say feel the fate of asia â€” south and southeast|asia will be decide in the|next|few|year by what happen in vietnam can not tell tonight as president with certainty that a communist conquest of south|vietnam would be follow by a communist conquest of southeast|asia but do know there be north|vietnamese troop in laos do know that there be north|vietnamese train guerrilla tonight in northeast thailand do know that there be communist support guerrilla force operate in burma and a communist coup be barely avert in indonesia the fifth large nation in the world so american president can not tell with certainty that a southeast|asia dominate by communist would bring a third world war much closer to terrible reality one could hope that this would not be so but all that have learn in this|tragic|century strongly suggest to that would be so as president of the|united|state be not prepared to gamble on the chance that be not so be not prepared to risk the security â€” indeed the survival of this|american|nation on mere hope and wishful thinking be convince that by see this struggle through now be greatly reduce the chance of a much large war perhaps a nuclear war would rather stand in vietnam in time and by meet this danger now and face up to thereby reduce the danger for child and for grandchild want to turn now to the struggle in vietnam there be question about this difficult war that must trouble every really thoughtful person be go to put some of these question and be go to give the very good answer that can give first be the vietnamese with help and that of other ally really make any progress be there a forward movement the report see make clear that there be certainly there be a positive movement toward constitutional government thus far the vietnamese have meet the political schedule that lay down in january|1966 the people want an elect responsive government want strongly enough to brave a vicious campaign of communist terror and assassination to vote for have be say that kill more civilian in try to keep from vote before the election than american bomber have kill in the big city of north|vietnam in bomb military target on november|1 subject to the action of course of an elect government will be inaugurate and an elect senate and legislature will be instal responsibility be clear to answer the desire of the south|vietnamese people for self determination and for peace for an attack on corruption for economic development and for social justice there be progress in the war steady progress consider the war that be fight rather dramatic progress consider the situation that actually prevail when send troop there in when intervene to prevent the dismemberment of the country by the vietcong and the campaign of the|last|year drive the enemy from many of major interior basis the military victory almost within hanoi 's grasp in have now be deny the grip of the vietcong on the people be be break since commitment of major force in july|1965 the proportion of the population live under communist control have be reduce to well under tonight the secure proportion of the population have grow from about|45|percent|to|65|percent and in the contest area the tide continue to run with but the struggle remain hard the south|vietnamese have suffer severely as have particularly in the first|corps area in the north where the enemy have mount heavy attack and where line of communication to north|vietnam be short casualty in the war have reach about|13,500 kill in action and about|85,000 wound of those wound thank god that of the have be return or will return to duty shortly thank to great american medical science and the helicopter know there be other question on mind and on the mind of many sincere troubled americans why not negotiate now so many ask the answer be that and south|vietnamese ally be wholly prepared to negotiate tonight be ready to talk with ho|chi|minh and other chief of state concerned tomorrow be ready to have secretary rusk meet with foreign minister tomorrow be ready to send a trust representative of america to any spot on this earth to talk in public or private with a spokesman of hanoi have twice seek to have the issue of vietnam deal with by the|united|nation and twice hanoi have refuse desire to negotiate peace through the|united|nation or out have be make very very clear to hanoi directly and many time through third party as have tell hanoi time and time and time again the heart of the matter be really this the|united|states be willing to stop all aerial and naval bombardment of north|vietnam when this will lead promptly to productive discussion of course assume that while discussion proceed north|vietnam would not take advantage of the bombing cessation or limitation but hanoi have not accept any of these proposal so be by hanoi 's choice and not ours and not the rest of the world's that the war continue why in the face of military and political progress in the south and the burden of bombing in the north do insist and persist with the war from many source the answer be the same still hope that the people of the|united|state will not see this struggle through to the very end as western diplomat report to only this week have just be in hanoiâ€”"they believe stay power be great than and that can not lose a visitor from a communist capital have this to say expect the war to be long and that the americans in the end will be defeat by a breakdown in morale fatigue and psychological factor the premier of north|vietnam say as far back as americans do not like long inconclusive war thus be sure to win in the end be the north|vietnamese right about think not no think be wrong think be the common failing of totalitarian regime that can not really understand the nature of democracy mistake dissent for disloyalty mistake restlessness for a rejection of policy mistake a few committee for a country misjudge individual speech for public policy be no better suited to judge the strength and perseverance of america than the nazi and the stalinist propagandist be able to judge be a tragedy that must discover these quality in the american people and discover through a bloody war and soon or late will discover in the meantime shall be policy to continue to seek negotiation â€” confident that reason will some day prevail that hanoi will realize that just can never win that will turn away from fighting and start build for own people since world|war|ii this nation have meet and have master many challenge challenge in greece and turkey in berlin in korea in cuba meet because brave man be willing to risk life for nation 's security and braver man have never live than those who carry color in vietnam at this|very|hour the price of these effort of course have be heavy but the price of not have make at all not have see through in judgment would have be vastly great goal have be the same â€” in europe in asia in own hemisphere have be and be now peace and peace can not be secure by wish peace can not be preserve by noble word and pure intention endure peace franklin|d.|roosevelt say can not be buy at the cost of other people 's freedom the late president kennedy put precisely in november|1961 when say be neither warmonger nor appeaser neither hard nor soft be americans determined to defend the frontier of freedom by an honorable peace if peace be possible but by arm if arm be use against the true peace keeper in the world tonight be not those who urge to retire from the field in vietnam who tell to try to find the quick cheap exit from that torment land no matter what the consequence to may be the true peace keeper be those man who stand out there on the dmz at this|very|hour take the bad that the enemy can give the true peace keeper be the soldier who be break the terrorist 's grip around the village of vietnam the civilian who be bring medical care and food and education to people who have already suffer a generation of war and so report to that be go to continue to press forward thing must do thing shall do first must not mislead the enemy let not think that debate and dissent will produce wavering and withdrawal for can assure will not let not think that protest will produce surrender because will not let not think that will wait out for will not second will provide all that brave man require to do the job that must be do and that job be go to be do these gallant man have prayer have thank

transcript the president good afternoon lady and gentleman question q. mr. president would give please current assessment of the situation in vietnam and the meaning and significance of what seem to be a rather obvious lull in the ground war and an equally obvious stepping up of bombing more specifically do agree with army chief of staff general harold|k.|johnson that more troop may be enough to see through to a solution the president the people of vietnam be in the middle of an election campaign to select a president and a vice president and about|60 member of senate in october will elect from time to time there seem to be from news report and operation report acceleration escalation lull and other various type of description of activity out there policy in vietnam be the same be there to deter aggression be there to permit the people of south|vietnam to determine for who leader should be and what kind of government should have be remarkable that a young country fight a tough war on own soil have move so far so fast toward a representative government since first go to honolulu have urge that step be take in this direction first|the|constituent|assembly be elect next a constitution be write at guam that constitution be give to a pledge be make that would have free and fair election that the people would have a chance to select a president and a vice president and member of the senate in the|last|2|or|3|day there have be a lull in the air activity that be because of the weather and because those who direct operation there feel be necessary to restrain and not to carry out certain target that be available to activity in the south be determine a great deal by what the enemy there be willing to do more and more here of late think that because of the loss have suffer because of the position in which find be less anxious to engage troop in combat as a consequence last|week have of the low kill in action rate that have have in several|weeks that be not to indicate that will not have a|bad|week next|week but weather enemy operation local condition all of those determine in some respect what happen between a lull and step up activity so far as this government be concern policy have not change remain the same be steadfast in determination to make pledge good to keep commitment and to resist the attempt to take over this little country by brute force q. mr. president in this same context what do think account for fear be express on capitol|hill even to the point of a suggestion today that the election possibly be postpone what do think account for fear up there that maybe the election will not be on the up and up the president well think that that be to be expect in all election have participate in a good many have never know where there be not some who question the efficiency of the election the accuracy of the election or the wisdom of the voter ' expression the date for the election have be set the nearer get to that election date the more charge will hear concern the individual candidate concern the method use concern the type of candidate should select and concern anything can question or criticize do that in this country will expect more of in a young country that be really have first overall national election under wartime condition hope that whoever win civilian or military leader will work together and will cooperate in the essential work that be ahead of realize that of most difficult period be go to be between now and the early part of september have realize that all along have have to adjust a good many thing in this country as long as have have a constitution during the election period have to forgo a good many thing have to indulge the luxury of a great many rash statement and criticism can expect that to come from south|vietnam be go to do all can be not election be not government be not run thing seem to this be a matter for the vietnamese but to the extent that counsel be seek and advice be follow be go to do everything can to see that have an orderly free and fair election ambassador bunker who be of most experienced man tell that be hopeful that this will come about q. mr. president a number of people be ask more for the city in the way of social welfare but how about the thing that have already recommend for example sir yesterday the house pass a social security bill close to recommendation but the rest of domestic program seem to be founder up on the hill how do see this the president have almost|100 measure pende in the congress of have be pass at the end of the congress in the|last|few|month of any congress try to make a maximum effort to clean up all the bill that be leave be very happy at the action that the|ways|and|means|committee in the|house|of|representatives take on social security measure there be some matter that bring into that have hope would not there be some reduction make that do not favor but generally speak recommendation be carefully consider the house act in judgment and pass by that overwhelming vote yesterday a measure that think the senate can improve hope will be send to the president do have a crime control measure that have be act upon by the house have a civil right measure that have be act upon by the house have an|economic|opportunity|act be now pende in the house committee have a model city bill that have be greatly reduce in the house but expect the senate to act on this|week have a rent supplement that the house cut out entirely that should be restore in the senate hope that will have the urban renewal measure almost|a|billion|dollars some|$750|million have the urban mass transit the urban research have the rat extermination the education bill some|15|or|20 measure that be extremely important to the city have talk to all the leadership about have talk to a good many of the individual member about think there be a general belief that the congress will consider all of these measure and believe pass most of do not expect to get everything that have recommend but believe will get most of think be essential as say in letter to senator mansfield have housing legislation have rent supplement have model city and have a good poverty bill believe congress will in the|last|few|day of this session face up to all of these measure and pass q. mr. president this|week a family that lose a young son in vietnam send a letter reject note of sympathy call the war senseless would be interested to know how this affect do upset how do respond to that kind of mail the president hear that over the radio regret of course the feeling of the family but can understand the feeling of any parent who have lose a child when hear just wish that be possible for to have enough time to sit down and express the gratitude this nation feel for the service of the young man such as the one who belong to this home and perhaps give a little well explanation of what be do there and why q. mr. president the south|vietnamese chief of state general|thieu have say that if be elect president in the election next|month will ask for a bombing pause and another attempt to get peace talk start could tell how feel about a bombing pause after the election the president would be glad to consider and discuss any proposal that would indicate would lead to productive discussion that may bring about peace in that area of the world be very happy that chief of state thieu and prime minister ky indicate that after the election be hopeful condition would be such that productive discussion and negotiation could take place the|united|state be very anxious to meet with the representative of the|north|vietnamese|government at any time at a mutually agree place to try to agree on some plan that will resolve these difference have make a number of proposal as of this moment there have not be communicate to any change of position any different from that reflect in ho|chi|minh 's letter of would of course welcome any indication on the part of the north|vietnamese that would agree to a cease fire that would agree to negotiation that would agree that if have a bombing pause that would not take advantage of that pause to increase man kill in action q. mr. president on the basis of that lack of indication from hanoi in opinion base on information have reach a stalemate in the|vietnam|war the president no think there be those who be take a pretty tough drubbing out there who would like for folk to believe there be a stalemate but have not be there can not personally say that have observe all the action that have take place general westmoreland be there have send there within the|month general johnson the chief of staff of army have just return from there general larsen a very able general who have be in the|ii|corp now for have just return from there all of these man think that the stalemate charge be nothing more than propaganda q. will come as no surprise to sir that there be a number of critic of vietnam policy inside and outside the press but the|minneapolis|tribune for example have in the past rather consistently support objective and policy in vietnam but on tuesday|of|this|week lead editorial call permission to bomb within of china a dangerous escalation of the bombing which could lead to war with china what would counsel be to this imply anxiety the president first would like to make clear that these air strike be not intend as any threat to communist china do not in fact pose any threat to that country believe that peking know that the|united|states do not seek to widen the war in vietnam the evidence have be quite clear think that the strike be make against the major military staging area and line of communication where the enemy have be concentrate supply and troop the transportation route and bridge over which those troop have be move against man have be hit think that these target be directly relate to the enemy 's capacity to move material into south|vietnam to kill american boy the target to be clearly identifiable be carefully select be all within north|vietnam the strike be make by the most highly train pilot that have employ every human and every technical precaution to insure that the ordnance fall on target do while everyone be entitle to opinion a good many of express the tough the going get the more difficult will be for some to stay with and go all the way and last out nevertheless believe that if be go to be there be essential to do everything can to protect the man have there be go to try to provide the maximum deterrent at the minimum loss q. mr. president representative john|conyers say will introduce legislation to allocate to rebuild the nation 's ghetto would support such a project the president think that have pende before the congress some|15 or measure to try to bring about an improvement of live condition in city involve many hundreds|of|millions|of|dollar the congress up to now have not see fit to pass the one have request be go to urge upon the program that have recommend would be glad to consider any other recommendation that may come but think will be rather fortunate if can pass the measure that be now pende before the congress without material reduction in recommendation for instance the model city program be design to improve the ghetto in the city of the land ask the congress for reduce that to about|$1|billion almost|half then ask for the funding of of that for model city this|year have cut that over the long run many|year ahead-- be confident that will make substantial increase in expenditure in the dry if can get the modal city pass this|year if can get the kaiser commission 's recommendation on the pilot project for housing pass if can get good sound poverty measure if can get rent supplement the program that have already be think out and work out would be very pleased in the meantime have a group in the|housing|and|urban|development organization under secretary weaver and secretary wood as well as mr. kaiser 's committee that have take a look at every proposal that have be make with a view to determine what merit hold and how far can go in embrace q. out in des|moines this|week several|thousand farmer authorize the leader of organization to try to increase farm price by withhold product from the market could give view on the appropriateness and the efficacy of this kind of effort by farmer to increase price the president think that of the very serious problem have in this country all of the consumer be try to insure that the farmer who produce the food eat and the fiber wear get a fair price for product do not think have get a fair price over the|year in line with the earning of the worker in industry talk with some of the farm leader before the des|moine meeting the secretary of agriculture bring in some of those leader think that this government should give very serious consideration to evolve some kind of a program that will give the farmer an equity of fairness on the same basis for bargaining for the price of product as have for the worker bargain for the wage receive for labor now the particular of that have not be work out just do not know how can obtain but do think that the farmer be on the short end of the stick do think that people be leave the farm by the thousand and go into the dry do think that be create a very serious problem for today the farmer get a small percentage of the dollar for the food that produce for than in any other period would very much hope that the administration at some date in the reasonably near future could find some legislation that would give to the farmer a means of bargaining reasonably and collectively as permit worker to do q. mr. president the constitution do not give the right to carry on this war without permission from congress be sure that realize that more than anybody in view of this misunderstanding that have occur about the|gulf|of|tonkin resolution why do not dear up this matter with critic by call for a new vote in congress on this matter the president sarah do not always clear up critic that easily will be with before the vote and will be with after the vote that be the way be in a democratic society have give a lot of concern and attention to attempt to get the agreement of the congress on the course that the government follow in commitment abroad as a young senator recall very vividly hear senator taft speak on several occasion about president truman 's intervention in korea frequently say in substance that while think what the president do be right do the wrong way that should have consult the congress and should have ask for opinion now under the constitution the congress have the right to declare to declare war be never intend that the congress would fight the war direct the war take the bomber off the ground put back on or ground but have the responsibility to declare the war senator taft think that president truman before commit troop in korea should have ask the congress not necessarily for a declaration but for an opinion for a resolution president eisenhower follow that policy in several instance ask the congress for an opinion discuss with the leader before submit the resolution back in may|and|june|1964 before the|tonkin|gulf consider what should do in order to keep the congress inform to keep in place and to keep in agreement with what action should be there in case of contingency there be very active debate in the government as remember back as far as then have the|tonkin|gulf after the|tonkin|gulf respond to the action with appropriate measure in the|tonkin|gulf but after that feel that should point out that there be likelihood there would be other instance could see the problem develop in that area so ask the leadership of the congress to come to the|white|house review with senator taft 's statement about korea and the action that president eisenhower have take and ask judgment about the resolution that would give the opinion of the congress be inform that a resolution be think desirable so the member of the executive and legislative branch talk about the content of that resolution a resolution be draft that be review with the leader on believe august|4,|1964 send a message up to the congress shortly afterwards and ask for consideration of a resolution some of the member of the congress feel that should amend the resolution even after amendment have already be put into by member to provide that if at any time the congress feel that the authority delegate in the resolution should be withdraw the congress without wait for a recommendation from the president may differ with could withdraw that authority by just pass a resolution which do not require the president 's veto could do by that suggestion be make to by a prominent senator readily accept so the machinery be there any time the congress desire to withdraw view on the matter state then and repeat now do not think the resolution be necessary to do what do and what be do but think be desirable think if be go to ask to stay the whole route and if expect to be there on the landing ought to ask to be there on the takeoff so secretary rusk and secretary mcnamara go before the|house|foreign|affairs|committee and the|armed|services|committee then go before the|senate|foreign|relations|committee and the|senate|armed|services|committee testify before all of those committee as say accept some suggestion by the congressmen and senators and amend the resolution the committee report the resolution believe the|foreign|affairs|committee of the house report unanimously the|armed|services|committee go along with on the|foreign|relations|committee of the senate think there be only|one vote against senator morse then go out to both chamber for debate have state view in the message and in the measure the leadership too express view in some of statement on august|5th,|6th and 7th during that period there be debate in the senate believe on the 6th and 7th do not recall the date exactly in the house but that resolution be send to by a vote of believe that every congressman and most of the senators know what that resolution say that resolution authorize the president and express the congress willingness to go along with the president to do whatever be necessary to deter aggression now be as say try to provide a maximum deterrent with a minimum loss think be well within the ground of constitutional responsibility think be well within the right of what the congress say in resolution the remedy be there if have act unwisely or improperly be go to be tough as get along the longer the fighting last the more sacrifice be require in man and materiel the more dissent the more difficult be go to be but do not believe be act beyond constitutional responsibility q. mr. president what be idea on the need for early processing of the|billions|of|gallon of oil from oil shale in colorado in the|rocky|mountain in view of the middle|east stoppage of oil shipment the president the secretary of the interior since the middle|east crisis have have a very special group in department deal with import and production matter various advisory committee give counsel as to emergency measure that could be take and some that have be take to adequately protect petroleum requirement be reasonably well in hand think that there be a great future in the oil shale development would doubt that in this immediate crisis that could expect any great acceleration but if at any time petroleum supply should be threaten more than be now the need should become great in any event just as the process develop can expect further action in that field but do not think be imminent now q. sir earlier|this|week budget director schultze say the administration hope to squeeze out between|$1|1/2|billion|and|$2|billion from the administrative budget could share with thinking as to where some of these cut may come the president yes from the appropriation bill send to the congress of which have be pass be examine now there be little indication that much in the way of saving can come from have talk to the chairman of the|appropriations|committee|of|the|house where originate last|week mr. mahon be here earlier|in|the|morne have point out the problem have have urge the leadership to set a target date for get those appropriation bill to so can be examine there be about|$61|billion worth of nondefense expenditure in the budget would expect to have to get the congress to reduce many hundreds|of|million perhaps several|billion in those appropriation if the congress fail to do will have to see where fail what bill contain the money think can be reduce and that have the low priority and then act each department have be instruct to immediately contact the chairman of subcommittee and urge to take action on the bill when those reduction be make by the congress if be not sufficient then the executive be pledge to make further reduction believe should try to keep borrowing within of the anticipate deficit hope that can get a tax bill that will raise plus that will amount to about|25|percent of the anticipate deficit then believe by refuse to pass certain measure that have be propose and be pende by take action on other measure that the house have reduce by reduce several|billion the congress and the executive can reduce the anticipate deficit by some|20 or in withholding deferment impounding and actual cut thank mr. president & nbsp & nbsp view transcript transcript fellow americans have endure a|week such as no nation should live through a time of violence and tragedy for a|few|minutes|tonight want to talk about that tragedy and want to talk about the deep question raise for all be tonight appoint a special advisory|commission|on|civil|disorder governor otto|kerner of illinois have agree to serve as chairman mayor john|lindsay of new|york will serve as vice chairman other member will include fred|r.|harris senator from oklahoma edward|w.|brooke united|stat senator from massachusetts james|c.|corman u.s. representative from california william|m.|mcculloch the u.s. representative from

origin of the recent disorder in city will make recommendation to to the congress to the|state|governor and to the mayor for measure to prevent or contain such disaster in the future in work the commission member will have access to the fact that be gather by director edgar|hoover and the|federal|bureau|of|investigation the fbi will continue to exercise full authority to investigate these riot in accordance with standing instruction and continue to search for evidence of conspiracy but even before the commission begin work and even before all the evidence be in there be some thing that can tell about the outbreak of this|summer first â€” let there be no mistake about the looting arson plunder and pillage which have occur be not part of the civil right protest there be no american right to loot store or to burn building or to fire rifle from the rooftop that be crime and crime must be deal with forcefully and swiftly and certainly under law innocent people negro and white have be kill damage to property â€” own by negroes and white â€” be calamitous bad of all fear and bitterness which have be loose will take long|month to erase the criminal who commit these act of violence against the people deserve to be punish and must be punish explanation may be offer but nothing can excuse what have do there will be attempt to interpret the event of the|past|few|day but when violence strike then those in public responsibility have an immediate and a very different job not to analyze but to end disorder that must seek to do with every mean at command through local police state official and â€” in extraordinary circumstance where local authority have state that can not maintain order with own resource then through federal power that have limit authority to use have direct the secretary of defense to issue new training standard for riot control procedure immediately to national|guard unit across the country through the|continental|army|command this expand training will begin immediately the|national|guard must have the ability to respond effectively quickly and appropriately in condition of disorder and violence those charge with the responsibility of law enforcement should and must be respect by all of people the violence must be stop quickly finally and permanently would compound the tragedy however if should settle for order that be impose by the muzzle of a gun in america seek more than the uneasy calm of martial law seek peace that be base on man 's respect for another man and upon mutual respect for law seek a public order that be build on steady progress in meet the need of all of people not even the stern police action nor the most effective federal troop can ever create last peace in city the only genuine long range solution for what have happen lie in an attackâ€” mount at every level upon the condition that breed despair and violence all of know what those condition be ignorance discrimination slum poverty disease not

model city program reduce request for fund this|year by third there be some who feel that can not afford additional good teacher for the child of poverty in urban area or new effort to house those who be most in need of housing or to aid in education to those who need to read and write be a strange system of bookkeeping believe should be count the asset that these measure can bring to america city rich in opportunity city more full of promise city of order progress and happiness instead some be count the seed of bitterness this be not a time for angry reaction be a time for action start with legislative action to improve the life in city the strength and promise of the law be the sure remedy for tragedy in the street but law be only|one answer another answer lie in the way people will

special privilege and pleasure for to visit tennessee for a texan be like homecoming because much of the courage and the hard work that go into the building of the southwest come from the hill and the field of tennessee strengthen the sinew of thousand of man at the alamo at san|jacinto and at the home of pioneer people this|morn visit the hermitage the historic home of andrew|jackson two|centurie have pass since that most american of all americans be bear the world have change a great deal since but the quality which sustain man and nation in position of leadership have not change in time as in andrew|jackson 's freedom have price in time as in history conspire to test the american will in time as in jackson 's time courage and vision and the willingness to sacrifice will sustain the cause of freedom this generation of americans be make imprint on history be make in the fierce hill and the swelter jungle of vietnam think most of citizen have after a very penetrating debate which be democratic heritage reach a common understanding on the meaning and on the objective of that struggle before discuss the specific question that remain at issue should like to review the point of widespread agreement be that be force to choose force to make a decision between major commitment in defense of south|vietnam or retreat the evacuation of more|than|25,000 of troop the collapse of the|republic|of|vietnam in the face of subversion and external assault andrew|jackson would never have be surprised at the choice make choose a course in keep with american tradition in keep with the foreign policy of at|least|three administration with the express will of the|congress|of|the|united|state with solemn obligation under the|southeast|asian|treaty and with the interest of south|vietnamese who have no wish to live under communist domination as commitment in vietnam require more man and more equipment some voice be raise in opposition the administration be urge to disengage to find an excuse to abandon the effort these cry come despite grow evidence that the defense of vietnam hold the key to the political and economic future of free asia the stake of the struggle grow correspondingly become clear that if be prepared to stay the course in vietnam could help to lay the cornerstone for a diverse and independent asia full of promise and resolute in the cause of peaceful economic development for long suffer people but if falter the force of chaos would scent victory and decade of strife and aggression would stretch endlessly before the choice be clear would stay the course and shall stay the course think most americans support this fundamental decision most of remember the fearful cost of ignore aggression most of have cast aside the illusion that can live in an affluent fortress while the world slide into chaos think have all reach broad agreement on basic objective in vietnam first an honorable peace that will leave the people of south|vietnam free to fashion own political and economic institution without fear of terror or intimidation from the north second a southeast|asia in which all country include a peaceful north|vietnam apply scarce resource to the real problem of people combat hunger ignorance and disease have say many many time that nothing would give great pleasure than to invest own resource in the constructive work of peace rather than in the futile destruction of war third a concrete demonstration that aggression across international frontier or demarcation line be no longer an acceptable mean of political change there be also think a general agreement among americans on the thing that do not want in vietnam do not want permanent basis will begin with the withdrawal of troop on a reasonable schedule whenever reciprocal concession be forthcome from adversary do not seek to impose political belief upon south|vietnam republic rest upon a brisk commerce in idea will be happy to see free competition in the intellectual marketplace whenever north|vietnam be willing to shift the conflict from the battlefield to the ballot box so these be the broad principle on which most americans agree on a less general level however the event and frustration of these past few difficult week have inspire a number of question about vietnam policy in the mind and heart of a good many of citizen today here in this historic chamber want to deal with some of those question that figure most prominently in the press and in some of the letter which reach a president 's desk many americans be confuse by the barrage of information about military engagement long for the capsule summary which have keep tab on previous war a line on the map that divide friend from foe precisely what ask be military situation and what be the prospect of victory the first answer be that vietnam be aggression in a new guise as far remove from trench warfare as the rifle from the longbow this be a war of infiltration of subversion of ambush pitch battle be very rare and even more rarely be decisive today more|than|1|million man from the|republic|of|vietnam and ally be engage in the order of battle despite continue increase in north|vietnam infiltration this strengthening of allied force in under the brilliant leadership of general|westmoreland be instrumental in reverse the whole course of this war estimate that north|vietnamese and vietcong be kill in compare with the|previous|year many more be wound and more|than|20,000 defect contrast more|than|5,000 americans and from other allied force be kill in action vietnamese army achieve a average of weapon capture from the vietcong to every one lose a dramatic turn around from the|previous|2|years --allie force have make several successful sweep through territory that be formerly consider vietcong sanctuary only a short time ago these operation not only cost the enemy large number of man and weapon but be very damaging to morale well what do all of this mean will the north|vietnamese change tactic will there be less infiltration of main unit will there be more of guerrilla warfare the actual truth be just do not know what do know be that general|westmoreland 's strategy be produce result that military situation have substantially improve that military success have permit the groundwork to be lay for a pacification program which be the long run key to an independent south|vietnam since february|1965 military operation have include selective bombing of military target in north|vietnam purpose be back fight man by deny the enemy a sanctuary exact a penalty against north|vietnam for flagrant violation of the|geneva|accord of and limit the flow or to substantially increase the cost of infiltration of man and material from north|vietnam all of intelligence confirm that have be successful yet some of people object strongly to this aspect of policy must bomb many people ask do do any military good be consistent with america 's limited objective be an inhuman act that be aim at civilian on the question of military utility can only report the firm belief of the secretary of defense the|joint|chiefs|of|staff the|central|intelligence|agency general|westmoreland and commander in the field and all the course of information and advice available to the commander in chief and that be that the bombing be cause serious disruption and be bring about add burden to the north|vietnamese infiltration effort know for example that half|a|million people be keep busy just repair damage to bridge road railroad and other strategic facility and in air and coastal defense and repair of powerplant also want to say categorically that be not the position of the|american|government that the bombing will be decisive in get hanoi to abandon aggression have however create very serious problem for the good indication of how substantial be the fact that be work so hard every day with all friend throughout the world to try to get to stop the bombing be entirely consistent with america 's limited objective in south|vietnam the strength of communist main force unit in the south be clearly base on infiltration from the north so think be simply unfair to american soldier sailor and marine and vietnamese ally to ask to face increase enemy personnel and firepower without make an effort to try to reduce that infiltration now as to bombing civilian would simply say that be make an effort that be unprecedented in the history of warfare to be sure that do not be policy to bomb military target only have never deliberately bomb city nor attack any target with the purpose of inflict civilian casualty hasten to add however that recognize and regret that some people even after warning be live and work in the vicinity of military target and have suffer be also too aware that man and machine be not infallible and that some mistake do occur but record on this account be in opinion highly defensible look for a moment at the record of the other side any civilian casualty that result from operation be inadvertent in stark contrast to the calculate vietcong policy of systematic terror tens|of|thousand of innocent vietnamese civilian have be kill torture and kidnap by the vietcong there be no doubt about the deliberate nature of the vietcong program nee only note the frequency with which vietcong victim be village leader teacher health worker and other who be try to carry out constructive program for people yet the deed of the vietcong go largely unnoted in the public debate be this moral double bookkeeping which make get sometimes very weary of critic but there be another question that should answer why do not stop bombing to make easy to begin negotiation the answer be a simple stop for and in may|1965 representative of hanoi simply return message in a plain envelope stop bombing for and hot rs in december|1965 and january|1966 hanoi only reply a political settlement of the vietnam problem can be envisage only when the|united|states|government have accept the point stand of the government of the democratic republic of vietnam have prove this by actual deed have stop unconditionally and for good air raid and all other act of war against the|democratic|republic|of|vietnam only last|month stop bomb for and 18|hour after many|prior|weeks in which have communicate to several possible route to peace any of which america be prepared to take response as know deliver to holiness the pope be this the|united|state must put an end to aggression in vietnam end unconditionally and definitively the bombing and all other act of war against the|democratic|republic|of|vietnam withdraw from south|vietnam all american and satellite troop recognize the|south|vietnamese|national|front|for|liberation and let the vietnamese people settle own affair that be where stand today have time reject a bombing pause as a means to open the way to end the war and go to the negotiating table the tragedy of south|vietnam be not limit to casualty list there be much tragedy in the story of a nation at war for nearly a generation be the story of economic stagnation be the story of a generation of young man the flower of the labor force press into military service by side or the other no one deny that the survival of south|vietnam be heavily dependent upon early economic progress most recent and most hopeful report of progress in this area come from an old friend of tennessee of the|tennessee|valley|authority who recently go as representative to vietnam to begin to work with the vietnamese people on economic planning for that area report and with some surprise may add that discover an extraordinary air of confidence among the farmer and the village leader and the trade unionist and the industrialist conclude that economic behavior suggest and quote that think that know how this be all go to come out mr. lilienthal also say that the south|vietnamese be among the hardest work people that have see in develop country around the world that to have be through of war and still have this amount of zip almost ensure long term economic development mr. lilienthal will be go with to guam saturday night to talk with new leader about the plan that will try to institute there aid program be support the drive toward this sound economy but none of these economic accomplishment will be decisive by and no economic achievement can substitute for a strong and free political structure can not build such a structure because only the vietnamese can do that and think be build as be talk to here a freely elect constituent|assembly in saigon be now wrestle with the last detail of a new constitution which will bring the|republic|of|vietnam to full membership among the democratic nation of the world expect that constitution to be complete this|month in the midst of war have be build for peace and justice that be a remarkable accomplishment in the annal of mankind ambassador henry|cabot|lodge who have serve with such great distinction be come to the end of second distinguished tour of duty in saigon to replace be draft as ambassador to the|government|of|vietnam mr. ellsworth|bunker able and devoted full of wisdom and experience acquire on continent over many|years as deputy be nominate and recall from pakistan mr. eugene|locke young and very vigorous ambassador to pakistan to drive forward with a sense of urgency in work in pacification be send the president 's special assistant mr. robert|komer to strengthen general|westmoreland in the intense operation that will be conduct in the|months|ahead be assign to additional topflight military personnel the good that this country have be able to produce so can be confident that in the|months|ahead shall have at work in saigon the ablest the wise the most tenacious and the most experienced team that the|united|states|of|america can mount in view of these decision and in view of the meeting that will take place this|weekend think wise to invite the leader of south|vietnam to join in guam for a part of discussion if be convenient for be gratify to be inform that have accept invitation should also like for to know that the representative of all the country that be contribute troop in vietnam will be come to washington for april|20 and meeting for a general appraisal of the situation that exist now this bring to final point the peaceful and just world that all seek have just live through another flurry of rumor of peace feeler year of deal with this problem have teach that peace will not come easily the problem be a very simple take to negotiate at a peace table and hanoi have just simply refuse to consider come to a peace table do not believe that own position on peace negotiation can be state any more clearly than have state many time in the past or than the distinguished secretary of state mr. rusk or ambassador goldberg or any number of other official have state in every forum that could find do want to repeat to this|afternoon and through to the people of america the essential now lest there be any doubt states representative be ready at any time for discussion of the vietnam problem or any related matter with any government or government if there be any reason to believe that these discussion will in any way seriously advance the cause of peace be prepared to go more than halfway and to use any avenue possible to encourage such discussion and have do that at every opportunity believe that the|geneva|accords|of|1954|and|1962 could serve as the central element of a peaceful settlement these accord provide in essence that both south and north|vietnam should be free from external interference while at the same time would be free independently to determine position on the question of reunification also stand ready to advance toward a reduction of hostility without prior agreement the road to peace could go from deed to discussion or could start with discussion and go to deed be ready to take either route be ready to move on both of but reciprocity must be the fundamental principle of any reduction in hostility the|united|state can not and will not reduce activity unless and until there be some reduction on the other side to follow any other rule would be to violate the trust that undertake when ask a man to risk life for country will negotiate a reduction of the bombing whenever the government|of|north|vietnam be ready and there be almost innumerable avenue of communication by which the government|of|north|vietnam can make readiness know to this date and this|hour there have be no sign of that readiness yet must and will keep on try as speak to today secretary rusk and representative throughout the world be on a constant alert hundreds|and|hundred of quiet diplomatic conversation free from the glare of front page headline or of klieg light be be hold and will be hold on the possibility of bring peace to vietnam governor averell|harriman with of experience of troubleshoot on the most difficult international problem that america have ever have be carry out instruction that every possible lead however slight may first appear from any source public or private shall be follow up let conclude by say this so much wish that be within power to assure that all those in hanoi could hear simple message america be commit to the defense of south|vietnam until an honorable peace can be negotiate if this communication get through and rational implication be draw should be at the table tomorrow would be none too soon for then hundreds|of|thousands of americans as brave as any who ever take the field for country could come back home and the man who could lead back be the man that train and send from here own beloved brilliant general westy westmoreland as these hero come back to home million of vietnamese could begin to make a decent life for and family without fear of terrorism without fear of war or without fear of communist enslavement that be what be work and what be fight for must not shall not and will not fail thank view transcript transcript the president good afternoon lady and gentleman be send a message to the congress this afternoon ask to act speedily to restore the investment credit and the use of accelerate depreciation for building be ask that this be make effective as of today will recall that last|fall when sign the legislation temporarily suspend these investment incentive say then and should like to quote now the legislation which have sign provide for automatic restoration of these special tax provision in january|1968 if however any early reinstatement would be appropriate shall recommend prompt legislative action to accomplish that result that action be appropriate today and be so recommend action today both the house and senate committee which consider this legislation recognize the need to restore these incentive promptly once the suspension be no longer necessary be now clear that the temporary suspension of these investment incentive have do the job that hope and expect would do interest rate begin to decline last|september immediately after this proposal be first submit to the congress since then aid by action of the|federal|reserve|board interest rate have come down as|much|as|1|1/4|percentage|point from september peak treasury bill rate be down from in september to yesterday interest rate on new municipal bond be down from in september to now last|spring and summer saving and loan association have virtually no new money whatever to lend to home builder and home buyer in the|past|4|months have be take in deposit at a normal rate and again have money to lend so be begin to revive the homebuilding industry since the recommendation be make last|september the excessive pressure on machinery industry have think ease very dramatically rise from september|1965|to|september|1966 order backlog for capital good have now already level off and actually decline in january for the first time in more|than|3?|year september the machinery producer be operate close to of capacity now operation have move down to a much healthy and much more efficient rate acute shortage of skilled machinist have now greatly moderate --import of capital equipment which have previously be climb on an average of a quarter have already level off so this evidence of moderation in economy have now be confirm by the survey of investment plan for conduct by the|department|of|commerce and the|securities|and|exchange|commission which be release to yesterday and publish this|morning a moderate increase of in capital outlay be plan for accord to these estimate that be a very sharp contrast to the increase of and in the|past|2|years so the action that take last|fall with the cooperation of the congress have help to do what think very much need to be do the imbalance in economy that be aim at have now be right say that would restore the tax incentive when appropriate and when the suspension be no longer need the suspension be no longer need propose that restore the investment incentive effective today will be glad to take any question q. mr. president in view of the recent statement and speech which either differ with vietnam policy or suggest major change in be consider any effort to de - escalate these apparent difference with such people as the senators kennedy and people who believe as do the president mr. smith have help and suggestion from member of the senate and from leader in public life throughout the nation and throughout the world think all of be very anxious to seek a peaceful settlement in vietnam as far as be concern the sooner the well be ready to use any procedure that the other side be willing to engage in have state position a good many time the machinery of the|geneva|conference the|united|nation an all asian conference or any other appropriate forum individual have different approach to this matter have the benefit of a worldwide network of train diplomat have the experience of the|joint|chiefs|of|staff have the judgment and recommendation of the cabinet the secretary of state and secretary of defense have constant consultation with ally in the world in particular ally engage with in vietnam on the basis of that information must make judgment and do sometimes those judgment be different from what other people if be in this position would make have no particular fault to find or criticism to make of other just must act in the light of the information have exercise the good judgment can and do what think be good for this country that be what be do without regard to personality or politic q. mr. president do think still that an income tax increase on july will be necessary the president yes have recommend a surcharge see no reason to change that recommendation the ways and means committee be now busy consider legislation involve matter of deep concern to the administration such as the social security bill think by the time get to hearing on the tax bill the administration will be able to make a very good case base on the economy base on all the factor that that committee must consider there be some doubt in congress about the wisdom of will have to debate those out as of this time would see no reason why should change the recommendation make in state of the union message q. what be reaction sir to the statement by arthur|schlesinger jr. yesterday to the effect that administration do not really want negotiation concern vietnam at this time the president have try to make abundantly clear to all the people of this country and all of the people of the world that be prepared to talk without condition be prepared to talk about condition or will talk about a final settlement say to think the last time meet that this government be always willing anxious and eager to go more than halfway but must call to the attention of and the american people that do not think that can stop half the war while the other side continue to kill man to lob mortar into air basis to seize south|vietnam by force just must repeat each|day that be ready to speak unconditionally or conditionally the problem with all of those who love peace and think most of do be not with this government be willing to go to a conference room any day be ready to go without stop or after stop if be willing to do likewise or if be willing to make any concession but do not think be fair to ask an american commander in chief to say to man ground plane tie hand behind sit there and watch division after division come across the dmz and do not hit until get within a|mile or of do not think that be fair to american|marines or american soldier have talk before while act of war continue do that in korea have the blockade on in berlin while have conference so be willing to talk unconditionally or be willing to talk conditionally all ask be equity and fairness and that the other side do likewise do not think ought to ask the american boy to do thing while other folk do nothing q. mr. president have the vietnam situation reach a stage where and adviser feel that time be now increasingly on side the president think be very difficult to speculate and give a direct reply to that question think man have give a very wonderful account of no longer see any possibility of a military victory on the part of north|vietnam think realize think be struggle desperately today to try to get a propaganda victory and to try to bring world opinion and public opinion in this country to permit to win here what can not win from man out there q. mr. president there be report that ambassador lodge would like to be relieve of post and that be look for a successor be there any truth to these report the president no there be no truth that be look for

mr. president vice president humphrey have say that be not happy with what the cia have be do in relation to financing student and other group what say do that reflect view the president do not think any of be happy to see nation divide and see country upset about situation such as mr. katzenbach be now study think would be well for all of if be unite and if all of could agree upon a wise course of action and be free of any mistake any error regret very much some of the intemperate statement and some of the severe criticism that have be make about various government agency include the|central|intelligence|agency have ask the good people in the government to study everything have do and to make a report to expect to receive that report sometime perhaps by the middle or the 20th of the month then will review and make such decision as may be indicate q. mr. president sir point that some of critic on vietnam have discuss in the|past|week be the question of whether or not what would ask in return for stop the bombing have change in the|past|year say that a|year|ago apparently would have settle for simply get talk if stop whereas now be speak of the need for reciprocal military action could discuss this the president have talk about reciprocal military action in every pause have have mr. bailey have have pause now on the first pause of make very clear that be take this action and would keep ear to the receiver and listen intently for any indication from the enemy that would take reciprocal action turn letter back to on the|third|day of that pause later have a pause be tell before go into that pause by some of the same people who be recommend a pause now or urge a pause now that if would go into for or at the|most|20|day could get reciprocal action make very clear that would take the initiative and would try to see if be willing to pick up the telephone go give no indication that be willing to take any reciprocal action have just finish a pause of during the|tet|period at the beginning of each of these pause make clear that be go to pause ask man to withhold action and give an opportunity to agree to come to conditional discussion unconditional discussion any kind of discussion have just complete that pause so would respond to question by say at the beginning of each pause make clear that would take action would listen intently for action on part have have hear the same story every time see nothing in any evidence that have that would give any indication that have have a change of mind or that be willing to take any serious action to stop this war be search every day be follow every lead can hope that will find something at the beginning of every week but can not give any assurance now q. mr. president sir in view of what mr. kosygin say after the truce end and in view of what mr. podgorny have say as recently as today do still believe the russians genuinely want peace in vietnam the president yes believe that the russians genuinely want peace think that most people in the world want peace some want on different term be hope that the|day will come when can find some area of agreement but do not think that that|day be here yet will just continue to try q. mr. president mr. martin 's term as chairman of the|federal|reserve|board expire at can tell sir whether have be pleased with the recent policy of the|federal|reserve and whether intend to reappoint mr. martin the president think that be evident from statement that first think be generally know that be glad that interest rate have fall and have come down think be clear that have be reduce from half of a percent in some instance to in other say in statement today that that be in part due to the action of the|federal|reserve|board be pleased with the action the chairman and other member of the board take that contribute to that q. mr. president there have be a public quarrel over the word permanent insofar as the bombing be concern the russians be say not to be use that word and hanoi have be say to insist upon wonder if could straighten out as to whether hanoi be demand a permanent end or simply an unconditional halt in the bombing the president do not want to quarrel with anyone think be rather dear to that have lay down condition that to mean that insist that agree to permanent cessation of bombing before may talk q. mr. president and secretary rusk have both talk of a military quid quo and reciprocal action in exchange for a halt in the bombing wonder if could be specific and say what would require from the other side as part of this quid quo the president think a good general way to express be what say at last press conference just almost any reciprocal action on part have say that would be glad to stop invasion of north|vietnam if would stop invasion of south|vietnam would be glad to halt bombing if would halt aggression and infiltration be prepared to discuss anything that be willing to discuss but be not willing to discuss anything as of now q. mr. president know believe in reciprocity wonder if have be able to get the russians to give any promise be make so many promise and overture to with good will and desire for concession the president yes have reach an agreement that be satisfactory to and in national interest in a number of field do not think that should take time to enumerate but the consular agreement be that be now be debate cultural exchange be another the space agreement be another be work very diligently although do not know what result will be forthcoming in connection with the nonproliferation treaty discussion will soon begin in connection with offensive and defensive nuclear weapon ambassador thompson will participate in those discussion in moscow have exchange idea and view and reach agreement to the benefit of both country and both people q. wonder if could deal with point on the draft your|advisory|commission suggest that the negro and other minority group be get a poor shake in many area of this country in military policy also suggest that in addition to the random selection system that have now endorse that overhaul the whole selective|service procedure tell first whether think the overhaul be necessary to correct the situation for minority and secondly why the random system seem to be draw so much opposition the president well can not speak for the opposition can only speak for have be many|year since have a thorough study of the draft such as have have very recently by distinguished panel the|marshall|commission and the|general|clark commission think make many good recommendation think there will be more yet to come that will flow from the debate in the congress unquestionably in the field of the|selective|service board and the draft machinery as in the general machinery of government at all level there have be discrimination against minority group will do all can to see that that be correct do not believe people want to see that happen or want to see that continue expect that the system now be work on by general|hershey and secretary mcnamara when issue executive order will be a fair and impartial random selection realize that there be differ opinion will hear much of during the extensive debate but generally speak agree with the conclusion reach by mr. marshall and commission state this in message to the congress want to hear the debate on the student deferment matter from both side the commission be divide on that question and then will reach a decision when the congress have have a chance to act q. mr. president ted|sorenson contend that would be break historical precedent for as a president who succeed to office to seek a second full term would end all this speculation for and tell if intend to run in and if hubert|humphrey will be running mate the president do not know miss|mean there have be that much speculation about be not ready to make a decision about future after january|of|1969 at this time think that down the road several|months|from|now would be the appropriate time for an announcement of future plan have never know a public servant that work better with or for whom have more admiration or who think be more entitled to the public trust than the vice president feel that way when ask the convention in atlantic|city to select feel even strong about today q. mr. president david|lilienthal and robert|komer recently report to on the other war in vietnam as understand say that there be substantial progress in establish a constitutional democracy report economic progress in fact gather the only place be not make any progress be in the propaganda war but report seem to be so different from what be hear on radio and television do not know if be at variance or just exactly how to describe can tell how appraise the other war and why so little be know about the president well be not sure that president be objective viewer or listener recall some very distinguished president not say be read more and more and like less and less guess all president feel that way the longer be in office do think that mr. komer bring back an optimistic appraisal of the situation in vietnam think that have make great progress there have be only|18|month since send troop there do not think can expect any quick overnight success story will be receive a report sometime later|this|month from both general|westmoreland in person and from ambassador lodge and from mr. porter and all of those engage in vietnam meet about|every|6|month will review in some detail weakness out there and be legion as well as strength be very proud of what the|united|states|government have be able to do in the|last|18|months in that area be very sure of victory be very grateful to the man who be make sacrifice to bring about q. mr. president have make any decision on the|west|coast strike against shipyard the president yes have order a directive prepare the lawyer be work on now perhaps the secretary be type will send later|today a directive to the attorney general to proceed on a taft hartley injunction think as know the|federal|mediation|and|conciliation|service over the|past|4|months have work rather intensively but have be unable to resolve this very difficult labor dispute the secretaries of defense and labor and the attorney general have recommend that establish an emergency board understand the attorney general will very likely go to court in san|francisco perhaps tomorrow morning on the matter q. mr. president point on vietnam do think the critic of policy particularly those critic within own party be base criticism on misinformation and second at what point would activate the pledge that just reiterate a moment ago of go more than halfway for peace or do feel have already go more than halfway the president just at any point that have an opportunity that have a signal from the other side of what intention be what be willing to do have take a rather steadfast position there have be little flexibility in if could get any sign from or any indication from that be anxious to stop the war that be serious about that be willing to talk unconditionally or conditionally would act very promptly so far as the critic of the vietnam situation be concern must grant to the same sincerity that reserve for now as to the extent of information think that vary think some man have more than other some man have more opportunity to have than other be just not in a position to know how much information each critic of policy in vietnam happen to have at the time make criticism may say that seem obvious to that some of do need more information sometimes because when make suggestion follow a course of action that have just complete make wish that all this information be available to everybody who be assume responsibility in the matter q. mr. president be ambassador lodge and general|westmoreland come here for a conference the president no expect will meet in the pacific area somewhere would expect would be perhaps sometime this|month q. mr. president be there any information have from the|space|agency sir on whether goal of land man on the moon in will be alter because of the apollo tragedy the president have have report from think have a very difficult undertaking think have be a very close question since the original target date be set be very hopeful will be able to keep do not think there be any guarantee that will at all q. mr. president some question have arise about lightweight rifle that have be send to neutral singapore on a straight sale basis while korean ally in vietnam have be urge the|united|state to provide some can tell if this have come to attention the president yes people be always very anxious that every of man have the good and most modern equipment available at all time have scrupulously inquire of general|westmoreland if man be short of any supply or any equipment at any time have assure that have be amply equip and amply take care of have from time to time help other nation some of the equipment have have have go to whether or not any equipment that have go to be desperately need in any other theater would doubt think that can rely on commander of the stature of general|westmoreland think be close to the scene think know more about think be a well authority while do not question either the purpose or the sincerity of the individual who assume to make suggestion in this area and will carefully consider at the present time be go to rely on general|westmoreland 's judgment unless somebody give something well thank mr. president & nbsp & nbsp view transcript transcript the president good afternoon lady and gentleman have be ask to give a statement about the consular convention that be pende before the|united|states|senate should like to say very briefly that hope the senate will give advice and consent to the propose convention with the u.s.s.r. feel very strongly that the ratification of this treaty be very much in national interest feel this way for principal reason first need this treaty to protect american citizen who each|year travel from this country to the soviet the convention require immediate notification to whenever an american be arrest in the|soviet|union insure right to visit that citizen within and as often thereafter as be desirable think that need these right help to protect american citizen these be right which the soviet citizen already have who travel in this country because guarantee by constitution the convention do not require the opening of consulate in this country or in the|soviet|union do provide that should any such consulate be open the official would have diplomatic immunity the secretary of state inform that no negotiation for consulate be underway and that the most that can envision in the foreseeable future be the opening of consulate in each country to be man by from 10|to|15 people there be presently soviet official in the|united|state who have diplomatic immunity if an additional consulate be open and if another be add to the mr. hoover have assure that this small increment would raise no problem which the fbi can not effectively and efficiently deal with in short think very much need this convention to protect american interest and to protect american citizen abroad in judgment raise no problem with respect to national security therefore hope very much that the senate in wisdom after full debate will see fit to ratify will be glad to have any question q. be hear and read and write a good deal lately about diplomacy aim at a vietnam settlement wonder if could give assessment of the peace front at this time the president mr. cormier state a question that know be on the mind of all the people here today and all the people in this country as know have underline over and over again the very deep interest of the|united|state in a prompt and peaceful settlement of all the problem in southeast|asia have say many time that be ready to go more than halfway in achieve this result would remind all of that would welcome a conference in southeast|asia this may be a geneva conference could be an all asian conference or any other generally acceptable forum would be glad to see the unconditional discussion to which refer in statement of april|1965 at johns|hopkins would participate in preliminary discussion which may open the way for formal negotiation be prepared today to talk about mutual step of deescalation would be prepared to talk about such subject as the exchange of prisoner the demilitarization or the demilitarized zone or any other aspect which may take even a small step in the direction of peace would be prepared to discuss any point which the other side wish to bring up along with point which and ally very much want to raise or there could be preliminary discussion to see whether there could be an agree set of point which could be the basis for negotiation so be against this background that study very carefully all of the public statement make which appear from time to time and which bear upon southeast|asia and all the view which receive from or through other government would not be helpful to and do not intend to do so to comment on any particular channel or communication at this point but may be sure that be diligent in search for the possibility of peaceful settlement in all candor must say that be not aware of any serious effort that the other side have make in judgment to bring the fighting to a stop and to stop the war q. mr. president have be so eloquent in the past about express desire for peaceful negotiation would like to ask whether or not if think would speed this war down the road to peace would be willing personally to participate in negotiation with some of opposite number such as the leadership in hanoi the president have make clear that if the other side desire to discuss peace at any time will be very happy to have appropriate arrangement make to see that that be carry out where would talk who would talk what would talk about be all matter that could be work out between the government involve have make clear to and to the world the principle that believe must govern a peace meeting of this kind and a settlement that would hope would come out of the honoring of the|geneva|accords|of|1954|and|1962 the right of self determination for the people of south|vietnam to insure that be free from the threat or use of force but have must say as of today no indication that the other side be prepare in any way to settle on these limited and decent term hope very much that can have some signal in that direction but in candor must say that as of now do not have q. mr. president do express willingness to negotiate a peaceful settlement imply any willingness to compromise on any of state objective in that part of the world the president think that any peace agreement will involve understanding on both part and certain concession on both part and certain understanding do not think that can determine those before come together or through any press conference technique can only repeat what say in the|state|of|the|union that wish that the conflict in vietnam be over and can only repeat what have say so many time will do anything can the part of this government to go more than halfway to bring to an end must say that face great cost face agony do plan to carry out effort out there be go to support troop in the field be go to work with vietnamese ally toward pacification and constitutional government while be do that every|hour of every day the spokesman for this government be under instruction to explore every possibility for peace but do not want to disillusion any of and do not want any of to be catch by speculation as of this moment can not report that there be any serious indication that the other side be ready to stop the war q. have time now use phrase no serious effort by the other to bring the war to a close how would characterize what have be go on in do recognize any sign of maneuverability or fluidity in position the president see almost every day some speculation by some individual or some hope or desire express by some government and assume that different individual get different impression certainly have different hope can only speak for john and with the information that have with the knowledge that be bring to must say that do not interpret any action that have observe as be a serious effort to either go to a conference table or to bring the war to an end q. mr. president could give assessment of how recent event in china may be affect the chance for peace in vietnam first of all assessment of what be happen in china and then how think that may affect the chance of a peace the president think that there be little can add to what the general public know about the event in china think that all know that be have very serious problem and would not think that would add anything to the strength of adversary in that area think that can see from some of the problem that have from time to time that unity be very important in connection with operation and do not see that the difference in china be go to contribute anything to the strength of on the other hand do not want to hold out any hope to that do not have and can not say at this moment that the event in china be go to contribute immediately to the end of the war in vietnam q. mr. president would discuss the report that there have be a decline in the infiltration rate to the south to say whether think the bombing have have any effect on this the president state in baltimore speech in early|1965 what expect to come from the bombing feel that would improve the morale of the people in south|vietnam who feel that have almost lose the war feel that would make the north|vietnamese pay a much heavy price for what be do and feel that would make the infiltration more difficult think have achieve all of those express purpose can not speak with cold assurance on the infiltration and the number each|day or each|week or each|month in some|quarters|of|the|year indication be that increase in other period of the|year the|next|quarter may go down some know of nothing that can conclude as highly significant from the guess and the estimate that have make q. mr. president have say in the past that would be willing to suspend the bombing of north|vietnam in exchange for some suitable step by the other side be prepare at all to tell what kind of other step the other side should take for this suspension of bombing the president just almost any step as far as can see have not take any yet and would be glad to explore any reciprocal action that or any of spokesman would care to suggest have make proposal after the other would like to have a cease fire would be very glad to stop bombing as have on previous occasion if could have any indication of reciprocal action but as of now have give none and assume be willing to give none until hear further q. mr. president last fall image be describe in some very harsh term some see as arrogant and not to be believe but lately these term have switch to something much more sympathetic and have be see lately by many as an underdog have be president for more|than|3|years how do feel about the job and if can bear to tell how do feel about in the press the president well have not give a lot of thought to in the press have problem with the press twice a day at regular briefing try to meet with at least twice a|month in some manner and almost every day see a collection of on subject or the other about something that interest think system require that and always try to reciprocate understanding now as for be president can only add to what say the first day be in this office be go to do the very good can need all the help that can get think the country and the congress and the other nation of the world have be very willing to be reasonable in relation with think all in all have succeed in obtain some of objective go to bed every|night feeling that have fail that day because could not end the conflict in vietnam do have disappointment and moment of distress as think every president have have but be not complain and if can endure in the press will try to endure in the presidency q. have be able to take a reading of the new congress be perceptively more conservative than the last one the president yes think be quite a different congress think be go to be a more partisan congress and think that be go to be more difficult to obtain favorable action on administration measure say after the first congress after the election in that the president 's mandate rarely last longer|than|6|months and hope that could get most of the pledge make in platform enact as soon as possible have never tabulate but believe senator mansfield make the statement that the congress have enact about|85|percent of platform still have some other thing to pass will win some and will lose some will try to work out an area of agreement where can take some modify language in certain legislation have to pass do not want to anticipate more difficulty than need to be go to do with the congress like be try to do with adversary in other place in the world be go to say to the minority party which do think appear to be able to find fault with almost every act that want to meet halfway and want cooperation want help because do not believe be good for the country to have partisan political in fight all the time ought to reserve a|few|week before the election for that and then all of work for america the rest of the time hope and believe that most member of the congress will feel that way q. mr. president for some time have be talk about build bridge to the country of despite the appeal of this government the|czechoslovakian|government have sentence an american citizen to what believe to be a rather harsh punishment how do this affect thinking on build these bridge to the communist eastern|european country the president there be many obstacle that come in the way in attempt to reach all of objective regret very much the incident to which refer be very hopeful that the government concern will take appropriate just and fair action be still determined that notwithstanding some difficulty that may arise from time to time that this be in the overall good interest of this country and be go to continue to try to work toward that goal q. mr. president the foreign minister in north|vietnam have say that if the|united|state stop bomb the north would consider a mere willingness to talk peace to be enough of a step on part to halt bombing or would some military move be necessary the president have see nothing that any of have say that indicate any seriousness on part be await any offer may care to make know that be in contact with can not speak for but be very anxious for to make any proposal and will give very prompt and serious consideration q. recently expert have testify at the|senate|foreign|relations|committee that the whole threat of communism have change a great deal since world|war|i and that be quite a different picture now do agree that the communist threat be sufficiently different the president yes still have problem but think change from time to time and think there have be material change in the thinking of various country and approach to relation to other nation since world|war|ii be very hopeful that can continue to try to evolve a satisfactory formula for get along in this world and be encourage in that hope every day see more encouraging sign than do discourage one along that line q. since the election of last|november a number of governors and other people have criticize the effort or lack of effort of and the national committee when mr. staebler leave the|white|house the|other|day say important thing be happen within the national committee can tell what be happen within the president do not see mr. staebler do not know what refer to think would be a well person to make that reply than be the|democratic|national|committee have a very competent chairman vice chairman chairman of the finance committee and the deputy chairman all of those people be in the committee when come into the presidency while have only have national campaign since that time be very satisfactory so far as be concern and think some people have use the committee as a kind of whip boy some of that really do not understand the function of the committee have work on both the national committee as an officer and the congressional committee as an officer for many|years have never be the function of the national committee to take over the congressional election support work with aid every way can in the national committee but there be not many congressmen that want the democratic national chairman to manage campaign in local district and for that reason have a congressional committee and have a senatorial committee be judgment that those committee be well run well operate do a good job this|year and know the|democratic|national|committee give more support and more assistance and more effort than have give in any period in history so do not know exactly what be refer to think if have a knowledge of the situation would not feel as badly as do about the present membership thank mr. president & nbsp & nbsp view transcript transcript mr. speaker mr. vice president distinguish member of

even decade have come here tonight to discuss with way of carry forward the progress of these|last|3|years these way concern program partnership priority prosperity and peace first program must see to think that these new program that have pass work effectively and be administer in the good possible way three|years|ago set out to create these new instrument of social progress this require trial and error and have produce both but as learn through success and failure be change strategy and be try to improve tactic in the long run these start some rewarding other inadequate and disappointing be crucial to success example be the struggle to make life well for the less fortunate among on a similar occasion at this rostrum in hear a great american president harry|s.|truman declare this the american people have decide that poverty be just as wasteful and just as unnecessary as preventable disease many listen to president truman that|day here in this chamber but few understand what be require and do anything about the executive branch and the congress wait before ever take any action on that challenge as do on many other challenge that great president present and when here in the congress join with in a declaration of war on poverty then warn will not be a short or easy struggle no single weapon will suffice but shall not rest until that war be win and have come here to renew that pledge tonight recommend that intensify effort to give the poor a chance to enjoy and to join in this nation 's progress shall propose certain administrative change suggest by the congress as well as some that have learn from own trial and error shall urge special method and special fund to reach the|hundreds|of|thousand of americans that be now trap in the ghetto of big city and through

and dignity as well as taxis this war like the war in vietnam be not a simple there be no single battleline which can plot each day on a chart the enemy be not easy to perceive or to isolate or to destroy there be mistake and there be setback but be move and direction be forward this be true with other program that be make and break new ground some do not yet have the capacity to absorb well or wisely all the money that could be put into administrative skill and train manpower be just as vital to success as dollar and believe those skill will come but will take time and patience and hard work success can not be force at a single stroke so must continue to strengthen the administration of every program if that success be to come as know must have do much in the space of two|short|years work together have recommend and the congress have approve different reorganization plan combine and consolidate many bureaus of this government and create entirely new cabinet department have come tonight to propose that establish a new department by combine the|department|of|commerce with the|department|of|labor and other related agency think can create a more economical efficient and streamline instrument that will better serve a grow nation this be goal throughout the entire federal|government every program will be thoroughly evaluate grant in aid program will be improve and simplify as desire by many of local administrator and governors where there have be mistake will try very hard to correct where there have be progress will try to build upon second objective be partnership to create an effective partnership at all level of government and should treasure nothing more than to have that partnership begin between the executive and the congress the|88th and the|89th|congress pass more social and economic legislation than any single congresses in american history most of who be member of those congresses vote to pass most of those measure but effort will come to nothing unless reach the people federal energy be essential but be not enough only a total work partnership among and local government can succeed the test of that partnership will be the concern of each public organization each private institution and each responsible citizen each state county and city need to examine capacity for government in today 's world as be examine in the executive department and as see be examine some will need to reorganize and reshape method of administration as be do other will need to revise constitution and law to bring up to date as be do above all think must work together and find way in which the multitude of small jurisdiction can be bring together more efficiently during the|past|3|years have return to state and local government about|$40|billion in grant in aid this|year alone of federal expenditure for domestic program will be distribute through the state and local government with federal assistance state and local government by will be spend close|to|$110|billion annually these enormous sum must be use wisely honestly and effectively intend to work closely with the states and the locality to do exactly that third objective be priority to move ahead on the priority that have establish within the resource that be available wish of course that could do all that should be do and that could do now but the nation have many commitment and responsibility which make heavy demand upon total resource no administration would more eagerly utilize for these program all the resource require than the administration that start so let resolve now to do all that can with what have know that be far far more than have ever do before and far far less than problem will ultimately require let create new opportunity for child and young americans who need special help should strengthen the head start program begin for child and maintain educational momentum by follow through in the|early|years should try new method of child development and care from the|earliest|years before be too late to correct and will propose these measure to the 90th congress let insure that old americans and neglect

place of decency through the landmark model|cities program intend to seek for this effort this|year the full amount that in congress authorize last|year should call upon the genius of private industry and the most advanced technology to help rebuild great city should vastly expand the fight for dean air with a total attack on pollution at source and because air like water do not respect manmade

draft law as fair and as effective as possible should protect what justice brandeis call the right most value by civilized men"--the right to privacy should outlaw all wiretappe public and private wherever and whenever occur except when the security of this nation be at stake and only then with the strict governmental safeguard and should exercise the full reach of constitutional power to

and serve by the best equipped police to be find anywhere will also recommend new method to prevent juvenile delinquent from become adult delinquent will seek new partnership with states and city in order to deal with this hideous narcotic problem and will recommend strict control on the sale of firearm at the heart of this attack on crime must be the conviction that a free america as once say

government try to do everything that know how to do to hold down yet be not as successful as wish to be in the|18|month after enter world|war|ii price rise not but in the|first|18|month after korea after the conflict break out there price rise not but during those period have opa price control that the congress give and war|labor|board wage control since vietnam have not ask for those control and have try to avoid impose believe that have do better but make no pretense of have be successful or do as well as wish great disappointment in the economy during be the excessive rise in interest rate and the tightening of credit impose very severe and very unfair burden on home buyer and on home builder and all those associate with the home industry last|january and again last|september recommend fiscal and moderate tax measure to try to restrain the unbalanced pace of economic expansion legislatively and administratively take several|billion out of the economy with these measure in both instance the congress approve most of the recommendation rather promptly as end price stability be seemingly be restore wholesale price be low tonight than be in august so be retail food price monetary condition be also ease most interest rate have retreat from early peak more money now seem to be available give the cooperation of the|federal|reserve|system which so earnestly seek be confident that this movement can continue pledge the american people that will do everything in a president 's power to lower interest rate and to ease money in this country tomorrow morning will

of fiscal and budgetary policy that believe will keep economy grow without new inflationary spiral that will finance responsibly the need of man in vietnam and the progress of people at home that will support a significant improvement in export surplus and will press forward toward easy credit and toward low interest rate recommend to the congress a surcharge of on both corporate and individual income taxis to last for or for so long as the unusual expenditure associate with effort in vietnam continue will promptly recommend an early termination date if a reduction in these expenditure permit this surcharge will raise revenue by some|$4.5|billion in the|first|year for example a person whose tax payment the tax owe be will pay under this proposal an extra over the 12-month period or

the|soviet|union the emerge spirit of confidence be precisely what hope to achieve when go to work a generation ago to put shoulder to the wheel and try to help rebuild europe face new challenge and opportunity then and there and face also some danger but believe that the people on both side of the atlantic as well as both side of this chamber want to face together relation with the|soviet|union and be also in transition have avoid both the act and the rhetoric of the cold war when have differ with the|soviet|union or other nation for that matter have try to differ quietly and with courtesy and without venom objective be not to continue the cold war but to end have reach an agreement at the|united|nation on the peaceful us of outer space have agree to open direct air flight with

responsibility to people be to assure that no nation can ever find rational to launch a nuclear attack or to use nuclear power as a credible threat against or against ally would emphasize that that be why an important link between russia and the|united|state be in common interest in arm control and in disarmament have the solemn duty to slow down the arm race between if that be at all possible in both conventional and nuclear weapon and defense think be make some progress in that direction the|first|few|month be in office realize that any additional race would impose on people and on all

that situation tonight want to just review the essential point as briefly as can be in vietnam because and ally be commit by the|seato|treaty to act to meet the common danger of aggression in southeast|asia be in vietnam because an international agreement sign by the|united|state north|vietnam and other in be be systematically violate by the communists that violation threaten the independence of all the small nation in southeast|asia and threaten the peace of the entire region and perhaps the world be there because the people of south|vietnam have as much right to remain non -

word could describe present course than those once speak by the great thomas|jefferson be the melancholy law of human society to be compel sometimes to choose a great evil in order to ward off a great have choose to fight a limited war in vietnam in an attempt to prevent a large war a war almost certain to follow believe if the communists succeed in overrunning and take over south|vietnam by

the|neighborhood|youth|corps or through head start a chance to learn so together have try to meet the need of people and have succeed in create a well life for the many as well as the few now must answer whether gain shall be the foundation of further progress or whether shall be only monument to what may have be abandon now by a people who lack the will to see great work through believe that people do not want to quit though the task be great the work hard often frustrating and success be a matter not of day or month but of year and sometimes may be even decade have come here tonight to discuss with way of carry forward the progress of these|last|3|years these way concern program partnership priority prosperity and peace first program must see to think that these new program that have pass work effectively and be administer in the good possible way three|years|ago set out to create these new instrument of social progress this require trial and error and have produce both but as learn through success and failure be change strategy and be try to improve tactic in the long run these start some rewarding other inadequate and disappointing be crucial to success example be the struggle to make life well for the less fortunate among on a similar occasion at this rostrum in hear a great american president harry|s.|truman declare this the american people have decide that poverty be just as wasteful and just as unnecessary as preventable disease many listen to president truman that|day here in this chamber but few understand what be require and do anything about the executive branch and the congress wait before ever take any action on that challenge as do on many other challenge that great president present and when here in the congress join with in a declaration of war on poverty then warn will not be a short or easy struggle no single weapon will suffice but shall not rest until that war be win and have come here to renew that pledge tonight recommend that intensify effort to give the poor a chance to enjoy and to join in this nation 's progress shall propose certain administrative change suggest by the congress as well as some that have learn from own trial and error shall urge special method and special fund to reach the|hundreds|of|thousand of americans that be now trap in the ghetto of big city and through head start to try to reach out to very young little child the chance to learn be bright hope and must command full determination for learn bring skill and skill bring job and job bring responsibility and dignity as well as taxis this war like the war in vietnam be not a simple there be no single battleline which can plot each day on a chart the enemy be not easy to perceive or to isolate or to destroy there be mistake and there be setback but be move and direction be forward this be true with other program that be make and break new ground some do not yet have the capacity to absorb well or wisely all the money that could be put into administrative skill and train manpower be just as vital to success as dollar and believe those skill will come but will take time and patience and hard work success can not be force at a single stroke so must continue to strengthen the administration of every program if that success be to come as know must have do much in the space of two|short|years work together have recommend and the congress have approve different reorganization plan combine and consolidate many bureaus of this government and create entirely new cabinet department have come tonight to propose that establish a new department by combine the|department|of|commerce with the|department|of|labor and other related agency think can create a more economical efficient and streamline instrument that will better serve a grow nation this be goal throughout the entire federal|government every program will be thoroughly evaluate grant in aid program will be improve and simplify as desire by many of local administrator and governors where there have be mistake will try very hard to correct where there have be progress will try to build upon second objective be partnership to create an effective partnership at all level of government and should treasure nothing more than to have that partnership begin between the executive and the congress the|88th and the|89th|congress pass more social and economic legislation than any single congresses in american history most of who be member of those congresses vote to pass most of those measure but effort will come to nothing unless reach the people federal energy be essential but be not enough only a total work partnership among and local government can succeed the test of that partnership will be the concern of each public organization each private institution and each responsible citizen each state county and city need to examine capacity for government in today 's world as be examine in the executive department and as see be examine some will need to reorganize and reshape method of administration as be do other will need to revise constitution and law to bring up to date as be do above all think must work together and find way in which the multitude of small jurisdiction can be bring together more efficiently during the|past|3|years have return to state and local government about|$40|billion in grant in aid this|year alone of federal expenditure for domestic program will be distribute through the state and local government with federal assistance state and local government by will be spend close|to|$110|billion annually these enormous sum must be use wisely honestly and effectively intend to work closely with the states and the locality to do exactly that third objective be priority to move ahead on the priority that have establish within the resource that be available wish of course that could do all that should be do and that could do now but the nation have many commitment and responsibility which make heavy demand upon total resource no administration would more eagerly utilize for these program all the resource require than the administration that start so let resolve now to do all that can with what have know that be far far more than have ever do before and far far less than problem will ultimately require let create new opportunity for child and young americans who need special help should strengthen the head start program begin for child and maintain educational momentum by follow through in the|early|years should try new method of child development and care from the|earliest|years before be too late to correct and will propose these measure to the 90th congress let insure that old americans and neglect americans share in nation 's progress should raise social security payment by an overall average of that will add to social security payment in the|first|year will recommend that each of the 23|million americans now receive payment get an increase of at|least|15|percent will ask that

security income must eliminate by law unjust discrimination in employment because of age should embark upon a major effort to provide self help assistance to the forget in midst the|american|indian and the migratory farm worker and should reach with the hand of understanding to help those who live in rural poverty and will propose these measure to the 90th congress so let keep on improve the quality of life and enlarge the meaning of justice for all of fellow americans should transform decay slum into place of decency through the landmark model|cities program intend to seek for this effort this|year the full amount that in congress authorize last|year should call upon the genius of private industry and the most advanced technology to help rebuild great city should vastly expand the fight for dean air with a total attack on pollution at source and because air like water do not respect manmade boundary should set up regional airshed throughout this great land should continue to carry to every corner of the nation campaign for a beautiful america to dean up town to make more beautiful city countryside by create more park and more seashore and more open space for child to

call the right most value by civilized men"--the right to privacy should outlaw all wiretappe public and private wherever and whenever occur except when the security of this nation be at stake and only then with the strict governmental safeguard and should exercise the full reach of constitutional power to outlaw electronic bugging and snooping hope this congress will try to help do more for the consumer should demand that the cost of credit be clearly and honestly express where average citizen can understand should immediately take step to prevent massive power failure to safeguard the home against hazardous household product and to assure safety in the pipeline that carry natural gas across nation should extend medicare benefit that be now deny to permanently and totally disabled

who move residence should develop educational television into a vital public resource to enrich home educate family and to provide assistance in classroom should insist that the public interest be fully serve through the public 's airwave and will propose these measure to the 90th congress now come to a question that weigh very heavily on all mind on and this nation must make an all out effort to combat crime the 89th congress give a new start in the attack on crime by pass the|law|enforcement|assistance|act that recommend appoint the|national|crime|commission to study crime in america and

juvenile delinquent from become adult delinquent will seek new partnership with states and city in order to deal with this hideous narcotic problem and will recommend strict control on the sale of firearm at the heart of this attack on crime must be the conviction that a free america as once say must let reverence for the law become the political religion of the nation country 's law must be respect order must be maintain and will support with all the constitutional power the president possess nation 's law enforcement official in attempt to control the crime and the violence that tear the fabric of community many of these priority proposal will be build on foundation that have already be lay some will necessarily be small at first but every beginning be a consequence if postpone

well as wish great disappointment in the economy during be the excessive rise in interest rate and the tightening of credit impose very severe and very unfair burden on home buyer and on home builder and all those associate with the home industry last|january and again last|september recommend fiscal and moderate tax measure to try to restrain the unbalanced pace of economic expansion

finance responsibly the need of man in vietnam and the progress of people at home that will support a significant improvement in export surplus and will press forward toward easy credit and toward low interest rate recommend to the congress a surcharge of on both corporate and individual income taxis to last for or for so long as the unusual expenditure associate with effort in vietnam continue

arm control and disarmament and through other form of practical agreement be shape a new future of enlarged partnership in nuclear affair in economic and technical cooperation in trade negotiation in political consultation and in work together with the government and people of and the|soviet|union the emerge spirit of confidence be precisely what hope to achieve when go to work a generation ago to put shoulder to the wheel and try to help rebuild europe face new challenge and opportunity then and there and face also some danger but believe that the people on both side of the atlantic as well as both side of this chamber want to face together relation with the|soviet|union and be also in transition have avoid both the act and the rhetoric of the cold war when have differ with the|soviet|union or other nation for that matter have try to differ quietly and with courtesy and without venom objective be not to continue the cold war but to end have reach an agreement at the|united|nation on the peaceful us of outer space have agree to open direct air flight with the|soviet|union have remove more|than|400 nonstrategic item from export control be determined that the|export import|bank can

begin to place near moscow a limited antimissile defense first responsibility to people be to assure that no nation can ever find rational to launch a nuclear attack or to use nuclear power as a credible threat against or against ally would emphasize that that be why an important link between russia and the|united|state be in common interest in arm control and in disarmament have the solemn duty to slow down the arm race between if that be at all possible in both conventional and nuclear weapon and defense think be make some progress in that direction the|first|few|month be in office realize that any additional race would impose on people and on all mankind for that matter an additional waste of resource with no gain in security to either side expect in the|days|ahead to closely consult and seek the advice of the congress about the possibility of international agreement bear directly upon this problem next to the pursuit of peace the really great challenge to the human family be the race between food supply and population increase that race tonight be be lose the time for rhetoric have clearly pass the time for concert action be here and must get on with the job believe that principle must prevail if policy be to succeed first the develop nation must give high priority to food production include the use of technology and the capital of private enterprise nation with food deficit must put more of resource into voluntary family planning program and third the develop nation must all assist other nation to avoid starvation in the short run and to move rapidly towards the ability to feed every member of the world community now bear a direct responsibility to help bring most basic human account into balance come now finally to southeast|asia and to vietnam in particular soon will submit to the congress a detailed report on that situation tonight want to just review the essential point as briefly as can be in vietnam because and ally be commit by the|seato|treaty to act to meet the common danger of aggression in southeast|asia be in vietnam because an international agreement sign by the|united|state north|vietnam and other in be be systematically violate by the communists that violation threaten the independence of all the small nation in southeast|asia and threaten the peace of the entire region and perhaps the world be there because the people of south|vietnam have as much right to remain non - communist if that be what choose as north|vietnam have to remain communist be there because the congress have pledge by solemn vote to take all necessary measure to prevent further aggression no well word could describe present course than those once speak by the great thomas|jefferson be the melancholy law of human society to be compel sometimes to choose a great evil in order to ward off a great have choose to fight a limited war in vietnam in an attempt to prevent a large war a war almost certain to follow believe if the communists succeed in overrunning and take over south|vietnam by aggression and by force believe and be support by some authority that if be not check now the world can expect to pay a great price to check later that be what statesman say when debate this treaty and that be why be ratify to by the senate will remember that stand in western|europe be there anyone in this chamber tonight who doubt that the course of freedom be not change for the well because of the courage of that stand sixteen|years|ago and other stop another kind of aggression this time be in korea imagine how different asia may be today if have fail to act when the communist army of north|korea march south the asia of tomorrow will be far different because have say in vietnam as say in korea this far and no further think reveal no secret when tell that be deal with a stubborn adversary who be commit to the use of force and terror to settle political question wish could report to that the conflict be almost over this can not do face more cost more loss and more agony for the end be not yet can not promise that will come this|year or come next|year adversary still believe think tonight that can go on fighting longer than can and longer than and ally will be prepared to stand up and resist man in that area there be nearly|500,000 now have bear well the burden and the heat of the|day effort have deprive the communist enemy of the victory that seek and that expect a|year|ago have steadily frustrate main force general|westmoreland report that the enemy can no longer succeed on the battlefield so must say to that pressure must be sustain and will be sustain until realize that the war start be cost more than can ever gain know of no strategy more likely to attain that end than the strategy of accumulate slowly but inexorably every kind of material resource"--of laboriously teach troop the very element of trade that and patience and mean a great deal of patience south|vietnamese ally be also be test tonight because must provide real security to the people live in the countryside and this mean reduce the terrorism and the armed attack which kidnap and kill civilian in the|last|32|months to level where can be successfully control by the regular south|vietnamese security force mean bring to the villager an effective civilian government that can respect and that can rely upon and that can participate in and that can have a personal stake in hope that government be now begin to emerge while can not report the desire progress in the pacification effort the very distinguished and able ambassador henry|cabot|lodge report that south|vietnam be turn to this task with a new sense of urgency can help but only can win this part of the war task be to build and protect a new life in each

destiny without coercion the performance of man in vietnam back by the american people have create a feeling of confidence and unity among the independent nation of asia and the pacific see in face in the|19|day that spend in home and in country fear of external communist conquest in many asian nation be already subside and with this the spirit of hope be rise for the first time in history a common outlook and common institution be already emerge this forward movement be root in the ambition and the interest of asian nation be precisely this movement that hope to accelerate when speak at johns|hopkins in baltimore in april|1965 and pledge a much more massive effort to improve the life of man in that part of the world in the hope that could take some of the fund that be spend on bullet and bomb and spend on school and production effort have produce a new reality the door of the|billion|dollar asian|development|bank that recommend to the congress and endorse almost unanimously be

economy estimate deficit for this|year at at and turn out to be pass and sign on march|15 the first tax measure which reinstitute some excise taxis accelerate the payment of other increase the withholding both by administrative and legislative action in september submit another program that involve the investment credit provision and by suspend that increase tax revenue a very minimal amount primarily that measure be pass in order to cool the economy most of the economist feel that be desirable and the congress agree do not believe that could have pass any more tax measure than

tax increase and there be not a single hand that go up read in the paper in retrospect some people feel very strongly there should have be another tax increase but in the light of the development of the economy at this moment do not think so q. mr. president in report from north|vietnam mr. salisbury of the times speak of heavy destruction in residential area around light industry there a rice mill and a textile plant sir do not believe that these industry fall within the category of target objective previously announce by have there be a change in tactic to include such target or have there be some sort of mistake the president none whatever there have be no change so far as the evidence that have at this time there have be no mistake can only repeat to what have say before and what have be say by other department of the government order be to bomb only military target those be the only order have issue believe that man have carry out those order to the very good of ability there will be civilian casualty in connection with the bombing of military target there be civilian casualty take place every|day some|this|morning in south|vietnam be concern with casualty in both south|vietnam and north|vietnam and wish that all of people would be equally as concerned think that the quicker can have a peace conference the quicker can arrange a true cease fire the quicker can stop this total war on both side the well off all of people will be but as long as go on civilian be go to be kill casualty will occur and regret every single casualty in both area q. mr. president general|westmoreland say this|week that estimate the war would last several|year do this change strategy or administration planning on the war the president think that be make the plan that believe be in the good interest of this country do not think anyone can say with any precision when the peace conference will come when a truce can be arrange when a cease fire can be agree upon when agreement can be reach between nation be prepare people to protect national interest and agreement and commitment lust how long will be require to do so be not able to predict if do predict would have no doubt but what would live to regret q. mr. president begin this|year tell the country that should be able to afford both the military effort in vietnam and the necessary welfare reform measure at home some people insist that the war take too much of budget even more people be suggest that the war will definitely interfere with the thing that need to be do in the|coming|year although be still weigh some of those decision what be the general outlook be the nation go to be able to afford what think ought to be do at home the president yes think the nation can afford to continue as have to fight war on both front do not think there be anyone who feel that should not supply man with what need would differ with in that respect think there be those who feel that as long as be in vietnam that should reduce expenditure every possible way here at home feel that ought to take all the water that can out of the budget and have spend several|week try to do that but be not who feel as say last|january and as will say again next|january that must neglect the health and the education of child that can overlook the need of city that must bring progress to a stop think that must strengthen people must continue effort to reduce poverty must continue the war against ancient enemy just as be continue in south|vietnam until aggression cease and until can provide each child with all the education that can take until can see that family have a decent income until can secure the measure that be necessary to improve city to curb pollution to reduce poverty think this nation with a gross national product of some|$700|to|$800|billion can afford what need to spend and shall so recommend the exact amount do not know this year 's budget be increase some because of increase need in vietnam in have send several|hundred|thousand man there budget this|year will be somewhere between|$125|and|$130|billion can not predict what budget will be next|year but as have be state by reliable authority and as have be write on good authority the general figure have be some say between|$137|and|$140|billion be highly speculative allow some|$2|or|$3|billion way or the other a great many of those decision have not yet be make there be several appeal pende from the military there be several important decision that have not yet be make in the field of health education and poverty expect to return to washington early|next|week to conclude the meeting in that regard and to have recommendation ready for the congress at as early a date as possible in short think can think must think will continue to do what be necessary at home and send man abroad what need to do job q. mr. president there have be a great deal of talk lately about image some writer discuss what call a credibility gap the harris and gallup poll have indicate performance rating at the low point since become president and there have be some unrest in among the governors do feel have be do thing wrong what do attribute all of this to the president well would not want to make an indictment or review all of contribution to this matter or all the reason and motivation of the various people who feel that mistake have be make in own judgment have do the good could have work at job have make the decision that think ought to be make realize that have make some mistake although know of no major decision that have make that would strike from the statute book tomorrow or would rewrite think that some of the decision have not be popular think that there have be criticism of the administration and regret all of that would hope that the nation would see thing pretty much alike in the|days to come all can say be be go to do the good can to make the proper decision those that be in the good interest of the country and then think if do what be good for the country the country will do what be good for q. mr. president can tell what the chief factor be that be now weigh in make tax decision and when such a decision may come the president be try to decide how much money will spend next|year in the military and civilian field be try to study development in the economy be try to determine the extent of deficit be try to anticipate as far ahead as can economic indicator will bring all of these people together the treasury the economic adviser the secretary of labor the secretary of commerce the congressional leadership and then attempt to make the recommendation that think be justified be work very hard on but have not make a decision be not ready to announce or make a recommendation today q. mr. president when do expect to announce a decision on the supersonic transport the president do not have any definite date the advisory committee that have appoint have give great consideration to this general mckee will have an announcement in connection with shortly just when the decision to move ahead will come on the part of the executive and the legislative be unable to predict at this moment be still a matter that be receive top consideration in the administration and of course after make study and recommendation be sure the congress will give very prompt consideration and high level consideration but until make and conclude will not know definitely what will happen q. mr. president would consider deal directly with the vietcong in negotiate an end of the war which u|thant seem to think be very necessary and also stop the bombing in the north sort of as a forerunner to peace negotiation the president will be very glad to do more than part in meet hanoi halfway in any possible cease fire or truce or peace conference negotiation would be very interested in what response be and what would be agreeable to before irrevocably commit this country if can look at all the decision make and reaction think would better be able to determine own have say on a number of occasion that be ready to talk any time and anywhere that the vietcong will have no difficulty in make view know to but all the question turn on when be willing to do and be willing to do the answer to those question be a strong yes but up to this moment have hear nothing from the other side just can not have a sided peace conference or a sided cessation of hostility or ask own boy not to defend or to tie hand behind unless the other side be willing to reciprocate now assure that be willing to meet more than

to any such program or any such visit q. mr. president can tell if event of the|past|few|day include order to stop bomb part of the dmz have move any closer to peace the president no think mr. moyers cover that in press conference yesterday be of course hopeful that any action could take would be reciprocate and would lead in that direction but there be nothing that could say that would be encouraging to along that line as a result of that action q. mr. president a lot of observer be observe that apprehension over the economy and the so call race question be far outdistance vietnam as issue in this political campaign what be assessment of these and other issue and would assess for not administration 's but the republican opposition 's handling of these issue the president think that every person will draw own conclusion about the section of the country be in and the local issue that may exist have no doubt but what full employment program vietnam engagement domestic problem include civil right problem will all play a part in some of the campaign think will differ from place to place and candidate to candidate think the 89th congress which be make up of both democrats and republicans but predominantly democrats have be a very effective and productive congress in the field of education have pass far reach educational measure health measure have pass more educational measure this congress than all the other congresses combine believe that most of the members of that congress will return home with a very fine record to support and think that most of will be reelect q. mr. president the stock market today reach low for the|year wonder if could give reaction to the rather steady decline of the market in recent|months the president think a good many thing have a bearing on market fluctuation think the high interest rate think the attractiveness of other security think some of the uncertainty that exist concern how much money the government will be spend next|year think the question of doubt about tax policy all of those be give weight too but think most of the people in this country feel like have be a|very|good|year there have never be a well one and believe that will be equally as good q. mr. president the|united|state have recently resume assistance to indonesia would tell what consideration be in take this action the president yes think the leader of that country be do good to build a stable government think that be very important to the people of this world feel in a position to be helpful the need be great carefully evaluate the request and decide would be in the good interest of own people as well as the people of indonesia to extend the assistance do be glad that have take that action q. mr. president sir monday the house be schedule to vote on the demonstration city bill title ii of that bill which be urge members understand to vote for provide incentive or rather bribe to local community to do away with own school system to have open housing and to create educational park where there would be or child go to school this would require busing of child long distance and would also bring about a system to correct racial imbalance now be a former schoolteacher wonder if would tell why think do away with the local school system as have be admit by educator in administration would happen wonder why think this would be well the president first would not concur with legal analysis of the bill second be glad of the opportunity that have give to state that believe there be no domestic problem that be more critical than the problem of rebuild city and give people who live in the city opportunity to develop as healthy educate productive citizen of society citizen who have the ability to get and to hold job and to take pride in the place in which live in order to try to get at the root cause of the problem of the city ask a task force of bipartisan leader of this nation to make a careful study of this measure recommendation be contain in the demonstration city bill hearing have already be hold the senate carefully and thoroughly debate the measure and pass by an overwhelming majority do not think give to either the interpretation that place upon or the fear that express do hope that the house will take prompt and favorable action early|next|week as say in the beginning and as would repeat again think be of the most important piece of legislation for the good of all american mankind that can act upon this session q. mr. president some of political opposition be say that the|great|society be suffer badly because of preoccupation with and spend for vietnam what be reaction to that the president well think the record speak for have recommend approximately|90 bill to this session of congress after have the most productive session the last session in history have pass through both houses about|75 of those bill would suspect in the|next|10|day can pass another when pass bill out of recommend think that be a pretty good box score pass measure through the house that have a majority for in the senate but could not get vote on-14(b and the civil right bill regret that but there will be other day and be sure that in due time a majority will prevail think all in all have a very outstanding record this|year be very proud of think every member of congress of both party can take pride in q. mr. president some of critic also be say that trip be motivate largely by political consideration would comment on that the president no do not think so just think would have to evaluate the critic and judge the circumstance and draw own conclusion and would not want anyway to spend all|afternoon talk about critic q. mr. president the|republican|coordinating|committee include president eisenhower recently say that public order that is both crime in the street and riot be a problem of great concern to the people of this country also charge that the johnson humphrey administration have do nothing of substance to date to deal with this problem think that be the way say wonder if could answer this charge and if could assess what think condition be in this country concern public order the president as have say in rhode|island indianapolis and before the methodist bishop in the|white|house last|week every citizen in this land must be concern with law and order the voice of reason must drown out the voice of violence have have very serious problem because of the condition in city the problem that exist there and the protest make by citizen hope that can keep violence out of the picture have do everything that know how in cooperation with the mayor the chief executive of the city and the chief executive of the states concern be very conscious of the problem be very concerned about be very determined to do everything within prerogative to see that reason prevail over violence and that law and order always prevail think that the protester have the most to lose by disapproval of some of the action that have take place and while be not oblivious to the problem that bring forth the protest be concerned that be protest without violence and within law and within order q. mr. president sir in a broad context on civil right there seem to be a dispute develop between those who feel that the|federal|government should merely strike down legal barrier to equality and those who feel that the government should play a more positive role in encourage integration in various facet of life wonder if could get thinking on these and where stand on that argument the president yes think the|federal|government must be a leader in this field and have have be president try by word and action to do everything could to bring about equality among the race in this country and to see that the brown decision affect the integration of school be carry forward expeditiously and in accordance with the law to see that the civil right act pass in the late fifty and sixty and more recently in administration be carry out in accordance with the intent of congress that the law be fully adhere to and fully enforce at all time realize that in some instance there have be some harassment some mistake perhaps have be make some people have be enthusiastic and difference have develop but where those mistake have be make think mr. gardner and the commissioner of education have be willing to always listen to any protest that may come and to carry out the law as congress intend should be that will be the policy of administration to continue to promote and to expedite the observance of the law of the land and to see that all citizen of this country be treat equally without discrimination q. former president eisenhower have say that should use whatever be necessary not exclude nuclear weapon to end the fighting in vietnam what do think of such a proposal the president without pass on the accuracy of quotation of president eisenhower would say be the policy of this government to exercise the good judgment of which be capable in an attempt to provide the maximum deterrence with a minimum involvement the easy thing could do be get in a large war with other nation be constantly concerned with the danger of that at the same time have no desire to capitulate or to retreat so have be the policy of present administration to provide the strength that general|westmoreland feel be necessary to prevent the aggressor from succeed without attempt to either conquer or to invade or to destroy north|vietnam purpose be a limited one and that be to permit self determination for the people of south|vietnam be go to be concern with any effort that may take on more far reach objective or implication q. mr. president do have any plan to take along a bipartisan congressional delegation to manila the president have not go into that in any detail at this time if any plan develop along that line will announce and give information on have nothing on now q. mr. president the vietcong have recently modify of precondition for peace namely no longer seem to be demand that withdraw before negotiation and no longer seem to be ask that be the sole representative of the south|vietnamese people do feel these change have bring any significant contribution toward peace the president no have not see any development in the|recent|weeks that would cause to hold out hope or to give any real justification for encouragement pursue every indication that have that may offer any possibility always have an open mind and be very anxious to find any basis for negotiation that would lead to an honorable peace but can not in frankness be encouraging to as a result of any specific action of recent|weeks q. mr. president could tell hope of what the result will be of this extensive tour of the pacific and asia that be go to undertake later|this|month the president would not want to get hope up and have disappoint because do not achieve everything that would like to see achieve have a great many objective and hope for the people of that area of the world third of humankind life in asia and all know think that problem be very serious life expectancy be very short comparatively speak per capita income be very low in vietnam now have the march of the aggressor 's heel stomp on the boundary of freedom love people have the problem of man be kill there every|day in an attempt to establish right to self determination so would hope that those nation who be commit against aggression in south|vietnam could have a complete review of the military effort be make and the result of that effort together with any analysis that leader may care to make would think the political and the economic problem of that area of the world would also be a very important subject for discussion think that should thoroughly explore each leader 's idea about how an honorable peace can be reach and what course reconstruction effort follow the peace could very properly take and how could participate in those effort would expect if afford the opportunity to be call upon to review some of thought about reconstruction about the development result from the election in south|vietnam and the political development to be expect there think generally speak will give an opportunity for the leader of the man who be commit to battle in vietnam to meet and explore way of find peace for bring an end to the conflict for make that area of the world prosperous and peaceful in the|year to come the invitation as know be extend by other country be sure that

for a tax increase next|year could give assessment of that situation now the president can not add anything to the statement that make in message to congress have succinctly summarize the situation today be the same as then be wait to know how much the congress will let spend this|coming|fiscal|year there be of the appropriation bill that have not yet pass until pass do not know what the bill will be can not reduce a bill that have not receive as soon as be pass will immediately review those bill determine how much can be reduce and then make a calculation of revenue in the meantime be ask secretary mcnamara to make a careful review of propose expenditure first the expenditure that have already take place for the|first|quarter from june through september will be visit with admiral sharp in honolulu will leave saturday night for a visit with general|westmoreland hope by the time that get back the congress will have send some of these measure so can determine how much can spend what revenue will be what the vietnam supplemental will be then will try to make recommendation that will see that provision be make for revenue to meet whatever deficit have if that be possible think that can not do this until receive these bill and these estimate all should bear in mind however when the congress vote add on to the remain bill must be bear in mind that each vote to increase be likely to be a vote to increase the revenue later will be specific with just as soon as those bill get here and analyze hope would be able to analyze so that by the time would have to act on could get some rough estimate be go to take whatever action be necessary to see that have a sound fiscal policy but can not take that action until the appropriation bill be vote upon and be determine for instance yesterday in the senate the committee report a bill that provide fourth of a|billion|dollar more than the senate ultimately vote so if have calculate before the vote be take would have be off will take prompt action as soon as the congress make recommendation and as soon as can ascertain from the military what good guess be as to the expenditure for the immediate future thank mr. president & nbsp & nbsp view transcript transcript frank|cormie associated|press mr. president what be reaction to the talk from hanoi about possible war crime trial for american prisoner and what may be the consequence of such an action the president feel very strongly frank that these man who be military man who be carry out military assignment in line of duty against military target be not war criminal and should not be treat as such be ready whenever the hanoi government be ready to sit down at a conference table under the sponsorship of the|international|committee|of|the|red|cross to discuss way in which the|geneva|convention of can be give full and more complete application in vietnam think that the thought that these american boy have commit war crime be deplorable and repulsive government have take every step that consider appropriate to see that proper representation on this subject have be make merriman|smith united|press|international mr. president again in connection with the war in vietnam there be a recurrence of request or recommendation that the|united|stat again halt the bombing of north|vietnam these request have come from everybody from the indian prime minister to faction in this country what be reaction to this sort of urging the president the|united|state have make clear to the|government|of|india and to all other government that at any time the government|of|north|vietnam be willing to sit down at the conference table and discuss way and mean of obtain peace in the world that on a|few|hours ' notice the|united|state will be there close representative be ready and willing and anxious at any time to enter into those discussion do not think that should spend all of time though examine what the|government|of|the|united|state may be willing to do without any regard to what the enemy may be willing to do have state again and again desire to engage in unconditional discussion and repeat again today but can not talk about just half the war should talk about all the war and have not the slight indication that the other side be willing to make any concession to take any action that would lead to the peace table and until there be some indication on part of course would not expect to tie the hand of man in vietnam garnett|homer washington|evening|star mr. president do contemplate any further action in the airline strike the president yes secretary wirtz have make a statement a rather strong statement within the|hour in connection with that controversy the president have follow the law have take every legal step that could appoint and convene a very fair and judicious board of distinguished americans who hear testimony that run into the hundred of page make proper recommendation and draw appropriate conclusion and submit to the president adviser examine those recommendation and as president of this country urge both labor and management to follow the board 's recommendation the board recommend that the airline pay approximately|an|additional|$76|million in increase wage and benefit after some consideration the management agree to the board 's recommendation but the union representative refuse have no legal remedy leave to in the government have do all can do under the law be continue to persuade the management and labor people to continue discussion be hopeful that will continue those discussion and work around the clock because the people of this country deserve to be serve while have no law that can force the man to go back to work think the patience of the american people be be try and although the government have do everything can do to keep the mail move to serve the need of defense the time have come when a settlement be indicate would hope that the party would continue to bargain until a decision be reach j. f. ter horst detroit|new mr. president would be possible or have any thought be give to the idea of a prisoner exchange with hanoi the president have have no indication that the government of hanoi be open to any of the appeal or any of the suggestion that have make from time to time think that have make very clear through emissary and through government who be talk to both party desire to sit at the table and discuss any subject that the other side desire to discuss but have receive no response whatever that would indicate the willingness on the part of the other side to do this john|steele time|magazine mr. president ambassador to the|united|nation and several other administration spokesman have issue rather somber warning about the course of the war in the event the prisoner be bring to trial wonder if would care to inform now what action may desire to take in the event that the trial do take place the president would not want to go further on that john than have go think the people of this country and the peaceful people of the world would find this action very revolting and repulsive and would react accordingly edward|p.|morgan mr. president related question on vietnam sir member of administration in the past have say in effect that be not seek a military solution to the problem of vietnam but have be widely interpret that omaha and des|moin speech change that be that true secondly what do feel about the theory that every major military conflict have a point of no return and when that be reach be difficult if not impossible to control the president well the answer to first question be no the omaha and des|moin speech do not change the consistent policy of this country that have follow ever since become president think that the important thing for all of to remember be that be ready and willing now and have be without any limitation whatever to discuss any subject with the enemy at any time that be willing to discuss but ed until give some indication that will sit down and talk see nothing to be gain from these exploratory excursion marianne means king features syndicate mr. president do believe that such development as the black power slogan and the disturbance in chicago and cleveland have create a new antagonism among white that may hurt the civil right movement the president be very concerned about the condition that exist in many of the large city of this country during this|summer have talk to the governors on that subject this|morning and have be in touch with a number of the mayor in most|recent|days as say in the previous press conference be not interested in black power or white power what be concern with be democratic power with a small d. believe that if be not to lose a great many of the gain that have make in recent|years in treat people equally in this country give equality in opportunity equality in education and equality in employment then must recognize that while there be a negro minority of in this country there be a majority of who be not negroes but believe most of those have come around to the viewpoint of want to see equality and justice give fellow citizen now want to see do under the law and want to see do orderly want to see do without violence hope that the lawfully constitute authority of this country as well as every citizen of this country will obey the law will not resort to violence will do everything can to cooperate with constitute authority to see that the evil condition be remedie that equality be give and that progress be make and shah do everything within power to see that that be do westinghouse|broadcasting mr. president do the administration have any information that the current wave of riot be the work of professional agitator who want to foment trouble in major city the president wherever there be trouble there be always individual to whom suspicion be attach but would not want to say that the protest and the demonstration be inspire by foreign foe do say that on occasion where find this trouble also find people who do not approve of system and who in some instance contribute to the violence that occur peter|lisagor in speech last|week suggest a conciliatory attitude toward mainland china under certain condition do have in mind an administration initiative that would lead toward a china policy in the|united|nation or be the administration attitude toward communist chinese admission to the|united|nation the same as have be the president be the same as be in speech spell out in somewhat substantial detail in that speech feel that should do everything can to increase exchange to understand other people better to have scientist and businessman author and newspaper people exchange visit and exchange viewpoint would hope that as a result of tear down these harrier that some|day all people in this world would be willing to be guide by the principle of the charter of the|united|nation that all people would want to cease aggression and would try to live in peace and understanding with neighbor so far as be concern every day be look for new way to understand the viewpoint of other and hope that at a not too distant date mainland china will be willing to open some of the barrier to these exchange and be willing to perhaps come nearer to abide by the principle lay down in the|united|nations|charter forrest|boyd mutual|broadcasting|system mr. president to carry the discussion of vietnam step further the saigon government have say believe last|night that the bombing of north|vietnam would stop immediately and ally force would be ask to withdraw from south|vietnam if hanoi would meet certain condition include stop fighting and withdraw force do agree with this be this in line with policy the president have not examine that statement carefully hear report and read a tick item on look with favor upon the general suggestion make there be nothing that would welcome more than for hanoi to be willing to stop infiltration and stop try to gobble up neighbor to permit those people to engage in self determination and select own government generally approve of the sentiment express in the saigon statement as interpret raymond|l.|scherer nbc|news old timer in congress go down in the virginia primary what do see as the political significance of this the president do not attach any particular significance to the defeat of a member of the house or the senate in this instance think be a question of the people of the state be rather evenly divide in connection with the senate race and that frequently happen under democratic system know of no unusual significance that would attach to think each year will see some of the candidate win and some lose robert|pierpoint under what condition mr. president would the administration consider reduce trade barrier against communist china the president think until can have more understanding of what china 's plan be and china 's hope be and what china expect to do in own way in the future would not want to determine complete course of conduct think have try to lead the way by ask to accept as visitor some of people some of businessman and to discuss these problem with fervently hope as have say again and again and again that all nation in the world will give up thought of aggression and force and will be willing to abide by the principle of the|united|nations|charter now until see some evidence of the willingness of the various country that may be involve to do that would not want to pass judgment on what action may be be hope be work to the end that all nation embrace those principle ted|knap scripps howard mr. president recall state of the union promise to seek legislation to deal with strike that threaten irreparable damage to the national interest do still plan to ask for such legislation and may this include compulsory arbitration in something like the airline strike the

to this point have be unsuccessful in get legislation that the secretary of labor and the other member of cabinet feel acceptable and that feel would have any chance of passage in the congress be

last|december when the increase be make by the|federal|reserve before the budget be submit and without coordinate with the other fiscal agency of the government but in the light of the situation as

that be not a very good politician some of the time be go to try to do job as best can do recognize this be election|year will be call upon to visit various part of the country expect to do so do not think that the people of california need any advice from to know that governor brown have be a great governor expect to repeat that statement if give the opportunity between|now|and|november not only

of bolivia today this conference and look forward with a great deal of interest other country be willing to carry out the suggestion originally make by a latin|american leader but the time have not be set think would be very fruitful and would be glad to attend and will assume time be give for proper preparation by the staff people john|scull mr. president there have be an assortment of rumor from communist source during the|past|week which indicate that the north|vietnamese leader may be plan to place american prisoner in factory or indeed even in oil installation in an effort to force to call off the attack what would reaction be to any such move the president john have try to give viewpoint and the viewpoint of this government on the man who have be capture would hope that would receive humane treatment in accordance with the principle of the|geneva|convention of believe that any other treatment accord would not be accept by the civilized world and do not want to make any prediction or speculation about what will happen have express viewpoint on what should happen richard|wightman mr. president recently say that freedom of information should never be restrict unless affect national security of paper women's|wear|daily obtain from of own source a news story about daughter 's wedding and print because of this the|white|house have withdraw press credential to cover the wedding do not think in light of this that rather go against own philosophy of press freedom the president guess would need a little more information before get into a complete answer to question the information have indicate that in order to serve all the press certain rule be lay down and that the press for convenience be ask to follow those rule so no one would have an advantage because either some do not accept the rule or some do not follow some difference emerge but if could have permission to just step aside on any of the detailed wedding arrangement would like very much to do so thank very much mr. president would give appraisal of how the|vietnam|war be go sir particularly whether or not more manpower may be require there the president yes more manpower will be require be work day

be an orderly democratic election where the majority of the people can freely express and select the leader of choice on the military front troop under general westmoreland|14 be give an excellent account of be attempt to anticipate the enemy and do everything can to deter from further aggression from additional infiltration and from the terror that practice the result have be that the enemy have lose about|10 man for every loss the americans have suffer believe the record for the|last|10|week show that the enemy have lose in excess of man each|week average have be something like this|week believe be less|than|100 and believe be more|than|1,200 the mail that get some|50 or letter from the battlefront each|week show the morale be high that the man be well train that be well and adequately supply and properly lead cease speculate a long time ago on how long this situation would endure but have say to and to the american people time and again and repeat today that shall persist shall send general|westmoreland such man as may require and request and will be amply supply have no doubt but what will give a good account of overall would say that the report from the capture prisoner and there have be about twice as many defector so far this|year as there be the|same|period|last|year some|10,000 compare to the interview from a sample of this|week indicate that about|15 to percent of the man that have be capture show that be boy from show that a good many of people take in the infiltration walk down from north|vietnam that a good many of be suffer from malaria and beriberi and other disease the man who conduct the bombing on the military target the oil supply of hanoi and haiphong do a very careful but very perfect job hit about|90|percent of the total capacity of that storage and almost|70|percent of be destroy report indicate that there be few civilian life lose if any estimate be that civilian be kill and be the one that be at the alarm

engage in a race between education and chaos for the|last|2|1/2|year have live here with the daily awareness that the fate of mankind really depend on the outcome of that race so come here tonight because be commit in the name of education to help decide that contest and that be the most important victory can ever win have set out in this country to improve the quality of all american life be concerned with each man 's opportunity to develop talent be concerned with environment the city and the farm where live the air breathe the water drink seek to enrich the school that educate and of course to improve the government that serve be at war against the poverty that deprive the unemployment that degrade and the prejudice that defy as look at other part of the world see similar battle be fight in asia in africa and in on every hand see the thirst for independence the struggle for progress the almost frantic race that be take place between education on the hand and disaster on the other in all these region too have a very big stake and nowhere be the stake high than asia so want to talk to tonight about asia and about peace in asia asia be now the crucial arena of man 's strive for independence and order and for life this be true because out of every people in all this world live in asia tonight this be true because hundreds|of|million of exist on less|than|25|cent a day and this be true because communists in tonight still believe in force in order achieve communist goal so if endure peace can ever come to asia all mankind will benefit but if peace fail there nowhere else will achievement really be secure by peace in asia do not mean simply the absence of armed hostility for wherever man hunger and hate there can really be no peace do not mean the peace of conquest for humiliation can be the seedbed of war do not mean simply the peace of the conference table for peace be not really write merely in the word of treaty but peace be the day by day work of builder so the peace seek in asia be a peace of conciliation between communist state and non - communist neighbor between rich nation and poor between small nation and large between man whose skin be brown and black and yellow and white between hindus and moslems and buddhists and christians be a peace that can only be sustain through the durable bond of peace and through international trade and through the free flow of people and idea and through full participation by all nation in an international community under law and through a common dedication to the great task of human progress and economic development be such a peace possible with all heart believe that be be not there yet have a long way to journey but the foundation for such a peace in asia be be lay tonight as never before must be build on these essential first be the determination of the|united|state to meet obligation in asia as a pacific power have hear argument the other way be build on the old belief that east be east and west be west and never the twain shall meet -that have no business but business interest in asia europe not the|far|east be really proper sphere of interest -that commitment in asia be not worth the resource that require the ocean be vast the culture alien the language strange and the race different these really be not kind of people but all of these argument have be thoroughly test and all of think have really be find want do not stand the test of geography because be bound not by but by ocean and whether by aircraft or ship by satellite or missile the pacific be as crossable as the atlantic do not stand the test of common sense the economic network of this shrink globe be too intertwine the basic hope of man be too interrelated the possibility of common disaster be too real for to ever ignore threat to peace in asia do not stand the test of human concern either the people of asia do matter share with many thing in common be all person be all human being and do not stand the test of reality either asia be no longer sit outside the door of the|20th|century be here in the same world with all of to be either partner or problem americans enter this|century believe that own security have no foundation outside own continent twice mistake shelter position for safety twice be dead wrong and if be wise now will not repeat mistake of the past will not retreat from the obligation of freedom and security in asia the second essential for peace in asia be this to prove to aggressive nation that the use of force to conquer other be really a lose game there be no more difficult task really in a world of revolutionary change where the reward of conquest tempt ambitious appetite as long as the leader of north|vietnam really believe that can take over the people of south|vietnam by force just must not let succeed must stand across path and say will not prevail but turn from the use of force and peace will follow every american must know exactly what be that be try to do in vietnam great resource really in this conflict great support for the man who be fight out there be understanding be willingness to carry perhaps for a long time the heavy burden of a confusing and costly war be not try to wipe out north|vietnam be not try to change government be not try to establish permanent basis in south|vietnam and be not try to gain one|inch of new territory for america then say why be there why well be there because be try to make the communists of north|vietnam stop shoot at neighbor be try to make this communist aggression unprofitable be try to demonstrate that guerrilla warfare inspire by nation against another nation just can never succeed once that lesson be learn a shadow that hang over all of asia tonight will think begin to recede well say when will that day come be sorry can not tell only the man in hanoi can give that answer be fight a war of determination may last a long time but must keep on until the communists in north|vietnam realize the price of aggression be too high and either agree to a peaceful settlement or to stop fighting however long take want the communists in hanoi to know where stand first victory for army be impossible can not drive from south|vietnam by force do not mistake firm stand for false optimism as long as persist in aggression be go to resist second the minute realize that a military victory be out of the question and turn from the use of force will find ready and willing to reciprocate want to end the fighting want to bring man back home want an honorable peace in vietnam in hand be the key to that peace have only to turn the third essential be the building of political and economic strength among the nation of free asia for year have be work at that task and the untold story of be the story of what free asians have do for and with the help of other while south|vietnam and ally have be busy hold aggression at bay many of can recall faith in the future of europe at the end of world|war|ii when begin the marshall plan back that faith with all the aid and compassion could muster well faith in asia tonight be just as great and that faith be back by judgment and by reason for

country have take new heart and want to assure tonight that never intend to let down america 's word will always be good there be a fourth essential for peace in asia which may seem the most difficult of all reconciliation between nation that now call enemy a peaceful mainland china be central to a peaceful asia a hostile china must be discourage from aggression a misguided china must be encourage toward understanding of the outside world and toward policy of peaceful cooperation for last peace can never come to asia as long as the people of mainland china be isolate by ruler from the outside

report to the president by secretary mcnamara say approximately|1|year|ago the buildup of force in vietnam be initiate at direction believe be timely say to report to the result of that action first would point out that never before in history have be possible to accomplish such a rapid and such an effective expansion of armed|force without the need to mobilize the reserve force and to call up the reserves to impose stringent economic control and emergency control on economy or to require involuntary extension of active duty throughout the service as commander in chief have reason to be proud of the magnificent professional leadership which man in vietnam be receive from general william|c.|westmoreland officer and noncommissioned officer and man this matchless leadership be parallel by the fact that no military force have be so well supply despite the fact that deploy a military force of more|than|100,000 man within and send halfway around the world have be able to keep that force constantly supply and equip so that at all time have be capable of bring to bear full power against the aggressor as general earle|g.|wheeler chairman of the|joint|chiefs|of|staff have report there have be no shortage in supply for the troop in vietnam which have adversely affect combat operation or the health or welfare of troop no required air sortie have be cancel as a matter of fact the air support give force be without parallel in history with ample inventory stock still on hand production of ammunition and air ordnance this|month will exceed consumption this|month indeed say secretary mcnamara believe may very well prove desirable to reduce plan rate of production substantially such action would be in keep with insistence that the|department|of|defense make certain that all military requirement be fulfil while achieve this objective with maximum economy for taxpayer by continue to carefully adjust expenditure and production and by resist the temptation to ask for more money and to spend more money than need believe say the secretary can avoid the carryover that be represent by of surplus and worthless materiel with which conclude the korean war buildup have be responsive have be forceful and have be effective just brief note in conclusion while final figure on the receipt and expenditure for fiscal|1966 which end june|30th be not yet available be very clear to this|morning after a conference with the chairman of the president 's economic advisers and the director of the|bureau|of|the|budget that the administrative budget deficit for this|year will be very substantially below the originally estimate in january|1965 and far below the forecast this|past|january this mark the|third|straight|year in which the actual deficit have be low than what the president predict in fiscal|1964 the actual deficit be below what the president promise the congress in estimate in be below what the president have recommend in estimate will not know the final figure for several|weeks but be already clear that the reduction in the deficit below original estimate of 18|months|ago will be great than achieve in in the|10|years|prior|to|fiscal|1964 the actual budget outcome average bad than the original predict figure believe the fiscal outcome for the|past|year and for the|previous|years for which be responsible demonstrate thing first have try to make a realistic estimate of both revenue and expenditure and to be conservative and careful in those estimate have make an unremitting effort to hold expenditure wherever possible at or below initial estimate be proud to tell that believe that will be do so far as domestic expenditure be concern this|year by several|hundred|millions|of|dollar third have maintain the strength and health of economy so that revenue each|year have exceed estimate for that|year which the budget director tell be somewhat unusual be determined to maintain a sound and a healthy economy which will provide the revenue that will need to meet responsibility in the|years|ahead now will be glad to take question if have any q. mr. president go back to the subject of vietnam what have be the effect of intensify airstrike on military target in north|vietnam what have be the effect on rate of infiltration in other word what have be the noticeable result since start hit the oil tank the president the evaluation that have and be still come in have new picture that be be analyze at this moment the evaluation that have indicate that about|86|percent of the know petroleum storage capacity in north|vietnam be hit the other evening in a very accurate target operation over the pol target in the vicinity of hanoi and haiphong the late estimate of the storage capacity actually destroy that have come in from the field be in other word of the storage be hit estimate be destroy can not embrace those figure because the picture be not complete but the general officer who have review this tell this|morn that think both estimate be within reason and think be a very successful operation think that every general officer carry responsibility either in vietnam or in the pentagon as well as most of career experienced diplomatic observer think that this action at this time be require by the event of the time q. mr. president last|saturday order an exhaustive review of the|selective|service.3 on the basis of conversation with adviser congressmen and what have hear from the general public what be appraisal of the defect and shortcoming of the military draft as be now administer the president have develop the good system that have know how to in the light of experience have ask the pentagon to review from standpoint and have do so be now present view to the appropriate committee in the congress have ask some of most distinguished citizen mr burke|marshall former assistant attorney general mr. thomas|gates former secretary of defense under general eisenhower mrs. oveta|culp|hobby former director of the wacs and a cabinet officer under general eisenhower and some of the good talent in this nation to review all the alternative available to a country which find necessary to draft young man do not want to prejudge that study that study be in the process of be make will have a very competent staff expect to have some conclusion and some recommendation to present to the next session of congress in ample time for to carefully consider before the present draft law expire q. mr. president in view of statement at the beginning of the news conference in which talk about the successful military buildup and also about the fact that may be able to cut back some of military production would be accurate for mr. president to analyze this as indicate that the major part of the buildup have now be accomplish in vietnam the president no would not make such an evaluation would say so far as ammunition be concern the secretary hope that within can make some recommendation think be feeling that those recommendation that will make which will have the support of the|joint|chiefs|of|staff will result in the saving of several|hundreds|of|millions|of|dollar over what the cost would be at the present rate that be not to indicate though that will not call up additional man that will not train additional man that will not procure additional plane that will not procure additional helicopter that will not send additional people overseas because will do all of those thing but be watch very carefully so will not have a holdover at the end of the difficulty in vietnam q. mr. president could assess the prospect now for democracy and for continue economic and social growth in latin|america in view of the military takeover in argentina and prior to that in brazil the president yes regret the action that take place in argentina recently have have similar action of that type in the|last|year or instance be less in the|last|few|month than have be heretofore be very encouraged by what have happen generally in be very proud of record of growth there be spend about|a|billion|dollars or a little in excess of a|billion|dollar in alliance for progress program in find the per growth rate have jump from to in excess of that already equal and exceed the goal that have set for the|alliance|for|progress notwithstanding the grave prediction make and the discouragement that the dominican people receive from many|quarter have have a peaceful election a majority of the people have exercise democratic right to select a government of own choosing have select that government have just finish a similar exercise in guatemala and some|four|or|five additional latin|american nation would say as look around the world at this hemisphere latin|america the prosperity the democratic evolution that be take place when look over africa look over southeast|asia generally with the exception of problem in vietnam when take a look at the|middle|east and western|europe have much to be thankful for generally speak much to be encourage about now find that true and that to be the judgment of most of experienced career diplomat think that on practically every continent when look back at africa just|a|few|months|ago at the serious problem have in the congo and so forth look at the|dominican|republic the panama situation the difficulty have in brazil the problem in chile have make great progress and generally speak be optimistic about most of the continent if could only solve the problem in vietnam and think be on the way to do that could have a world that be rather peaceful and generally prosperous q. mr. president survey of every kind be be conduct about some of recently show a drop in performance rating today the harris poll give high point for vietnam action last|week a newspaper poll in california say that the california democrats prefer senator robert|kennedy over to how much be influence by these poll the president well think all read and be affect by of course would like for every poll to be of liking like to feel that all of be accurate have have a dozen poll guess in the|last|week do not read about the favorable one though have observe mr. gallup report last|week that have gain mr. harris report today that have about|55|percent of the total in the country mr. quayle have make a nationwide survey and show about|55|percent now that be what report as a landslide during general|eisenhower 's period poll in california show a very healthy majority for approval of record believe that will show the same thing in iowa those be the only|two poll that have cite have a number of that come to each|day if be interested in will see that mr. moyers make available to maine show that be unusual for a democratic administration new|hampshire new|jersey michigan although governor romney have a substantial majority of the democrats favor record as governor lead governor romney in own state in tennessee be that be considerably well than be in virginia be texas have a good many poll from all over the country be not disturbing to think that a rating in the country that be the landslide that general|eisenhower defeat mr. adlai|stevenson by so be not upset would all like to have as much approval as can get but have to make judgment and do what think be right then trust the judgment of the people at election time have not the slight doubt but what will exercise good judgment q. mr. president there have be many favorable comment lately in the press by military leader on vietnam could give assessment of the situation as be today the president think boy under general|westmoreland staff officer and the man be lead be do an exceptionally fine job want to encourage in every way can want to support in every way can be fearful that sometimes do not give enough thought to those man as sit here in the luxury of front porch and lawn that do not recognize the man that be die for out in the rice paddy do not think can speak too well of record have be outstanding result be very good diplomatic report indicate that the oppose force no longer really expect a military victory in south|vietnam be aware of the danger of speculation do not pay anything extra for so be not go to guess for suffice to say be proud of what the man be do if everyone in this country be work as hard to support the principle of democracy as the man in vietnam be think would have little to worry about q. mr. president can tell anything about the public reaction as reflect in the telegram and letter to on decision to bomb the haiphong and hanoi oil field the president yes first of all all the communist country generally speak oppose rather vehemently some of be rather vicious in statement and think inaccurate that be bomb civilian target and kill civilian be very careful to select military target that be not in the center of the area and to spare all civilian take every precaution available to can not understand the thinking of any country or any people or any person that say should sit by with hand tie behind while these man bring mortar hand grenade and bomb into barrack and kill marines attack camp murder the village chief and that should not do anything about now have try to make this difficult for to continue at present rate do not say will stop the infiltration do not say that will even reduce but do think will make more difficult for and do think will require to assign additional people do think will give problem have have a policy of measure response and gradually increase strength from time to time plan to continue that most of the communist country express disapproval most of the country in the area involve and all of the country who have body there who have man in uniform there approve action be difficult for to understand the response of some nation that be not involve when a|few|years|ago when own security be at stake need american man and want to furnish american troop not to be understanding of what be try to do to help other maintain independence now would say that have very encouraging report from a good many of ally be disappoint in a few expect the regular communist response namely that this would harden the opposition and that would not lead to negotiation that be kill civilian and that be not bomb military target but all those thing consider in advance and think pursue the right course since be talk about poll be inform today that the national poll show that of the people of this country approve this position think do the right thing at the right time hope that can continue to be as successful in the|days|ahead in connection with general|westmoreland 's operation as be in this particular exercise q. mr. president regard racial incident sir in various city what be estimate of the immediate hazard in the situation and do have any advice for americans in this connection the president yes be try in every way can to find employment for the unemployed in city be try in every way can to get people to quit practice discrimination in city be try to meet the poverty situation as find with the limited resource at command be not interested in black power and be not interested in white power but be interested in american democratic power with a small d. believe that the citizen ought to be arm with the power to vote believe the citizen regardless of race or religion or color ought to be arm with the right to have a job at decent wage believe that every citizen ought to have the right to have a decent home be do everything can as quickly as can under voter right bill under civil right bill under housing bill under proposal have make in cooperation with the mayor under the able leadership of the vice president to improve these terrible condition that exist in the ghetto of this country now can not do all overnight be much too late but have do more in the|last|24|months than have be do in any similar 24-year period to face up to these condition of health education poverty and discrimination be go to continue as long as be president to do everything can to see that all citizen be treat equally and have equal opportunity when achieve that think will find a good deal of the solution to the problem which mention q. mr. president a paris magazine a french magazine report that ho|chi|minh tell red|china and the|soviet|union if do not give more help would have to come to term with next|year have anything on that the president have not read the paris magazine q. mr. president how do assess the chance now for a treaty ban the spread of nuclear weapon do decision to bomb closer to hanoi and halphong in any way jeopardize that the president no do not think so be do everything can to reach an agreement on such a treaty be very anxious to do hope the|soviet|union will meet and find an acceptable compromise in language which can both live with have some problem at the moment but be go to live up to the test ban treaty religiously and scrupulously follow be go to do everything within the power of most imaginative people to find language which will bring the nuclear power together in a treaty which will provide nonproliferation think be of the most important decision of time and be go to do everything to bring people together on q. sir in light of these recently publish poll can give thinking now about run again in the president no think will see a good deal of this|year have be in about states in the|last|several|weeks expect to get around the country and talk to the people about problem and program but have no announcement to make about own future except to say be go to do dead level best to serve all the people of this country q. mr. president in light of the upcoming election do plan to do much travel between|now|and|november the president have a legislative program yet to be act on have more|than|half of already enact have about|85|percent of enact last|year hope to get a

all in the|last|3|or|4|week at that rate could cover all of between now and say late|october thank mr. president & nbsp & nbsp view transcript transcript governor and mrs. morrison mayor governor phil|sorensen dear and good friend congressman callan lady and gentleman of the great state|of|nebraska want to know governor morrison that have not be able to hear much about anything since and mayor sorensen and governor sorensen and mrs. morrison keep lady|bird out here beautify for an|entire|day except about the glory of nebraska be delighted to come back to omaha and to this great state to confirm all the good thing that have say to about have come to omaha today because want to speak to about the most important business in time the business of peace in the world two|years|ago|this|week when be also speak out here in the midwest say that the peace seek be a world where no nation fear another or no nation can force another to follow command be a world where difference be solve without destruction and common effort be direct at common problem this be still true as meet here this|afternoon be convinced that after decade of war and threat of war peace be more within reach than at any time in this|century believe this because have make up mind to deal with the most common threat to peace in the world be determined to match resolution with action but what be these threat first be the desire of most people to win a well way of life that be true of here in omaha and that be true of most people who want to win a well way of life everywhere in the world second be the design of a few people the design of some people to force particular way of life on other people now if ignore these threat or if attempt to meet only by the rhetoric of visionary intention instead of good work of determination be certain that tyranny and not peace will be ultimate fate if the strong and the wealthy turn from the need of the weak and the poor frustration be sure to be follow by force no peace and no power be strong enough to stand for long against the restless discontent of million of human being who be without any hope that be why stand here this|afternoon in omaha at the end of a very important lifeline at the other end of that lifeline out yond be india india a nation of human being the wheat here this|afternoon be part of shield against the catastrophe of drought and famine this single load of grain will provide the margin of life for more|than|2,500 family throughout the entire balance of this|year but be only a very tiny fraction of what america 's response to india 's need have be would remind that since january|1 5|million|ton of american wheat have already be ship to india that is more|than|2|1/2 time the annual wheat production of the state of nebraska and this be only|about|half the grain that and other nation be provide india this|year in order to help overcome the bad drought that people have ever suffer in the history of nation and america 's job be not yet over here today in the center of the great food produce area anywhere on this globe americans must face a sobering fact most of the world 's population be lose the battle to feed if present trend continue can now see the point at which even own vast productive resource include the|millions|of|acre of farmland that now hold in reserve will not be sufficient to meet the requirement of human being for food in food|for|freedom message that the president send to the congress request the authority and the fund to provide food on very special term to those country that be willing to increase own production will lend america 's technical knowledge will lend america 's practical experience to those people who need most and who be willing to prove to that be willing to try to help in addition to that will support program of capital investment water development farm machinery pesticide seed research and fertilizer will introduce all the american know how in country to try to help learn to produce the food that be necessary to satisfy the human body that live in land now these be only beginning must work for a global effort hunger know no ideology hunger know no single race or no single nationality no party democratic or republican recognize the contribution of the|soviet|union recognize the contribution of yugoslavia in contribute food to india be glad that see fit to try to do part welcome the support of every nation in the world when that support be give to feed hungry human being in this kind of cooperation find the seed of unity against the common enemy of all mankind long for the|day when and other whatever political creed will turn joint resource to the battle against poverty ignorance and disease because honestly believe that these enemy poverty and ignorance and disease be the enemy of peace in the world but that day be not here because some man in some place still insist on try to force way of life on other people that be the second threat that want to talk about out here in omaha today that be the second threat to peace try to force way of life on other people that be the threat that be stand up to with proud sailor soldier airman and marines in south|vietnam at this|hour now want to point out to that the conflict there be important for many reason but have time to mention only a few be go to mention specifically the first reason believe that the right of other people be just as important as own believe that be obligate to help those whose right be be threaten by brute force individual can never escape a sense of decency and respect for other neither can democratic nation if man here in omaha unlawfully force another to do what command then rebel against the injustice because know be wrong for man here in omaha to force another one to do what want to do unless human concern have disappear from all of value also know that be necessary emphasize necessary"--to help that man that be be force to defend this same principle be true for nations-- nation which live by respect of the right of other if government use force to violate another people 's right can not ignore the injustice the threat to own right the danger to peace in the entire world that be what be happen at this|hour in south|vietnam the north|vietnamese be try to deny the people of south|vietnam the right to build own nation the right to choose own system of government the right to live and to work in peace to those people in america who say have never have this thing explain to want to repeat that again the|north|vietnamese at this|hour be try to deny the people of south|vietnam the right to build own nation the right to choose own system of government the right to go and vote in a free election and select own people the right to live and work in peace south|vietnam have ask for help only if abandon respect for the right of other people could turn down plea second south vietnam be important to the security of the rest of all of asia a|few|years|ago the nation of free asia lie under the shadow of communist china face a common threat but not in unity be still catch up in old dispute and dangerous confrontation be ripe for aggression now that picture be change shield by the courage of the|south|vietnamese the people of free asia today be drive toward economic and social development in a new spirit of regional cooperation all have to do be look at that map and will see independence grow thrive blossom and blooming be convinced that the vietnamese people and ally be go to stand firm against the conqueror or against aggression fighting in vietnam therefore be buy time not only for south|vietnam but be buy time for a new and a vital grow asia to emerge and develop additional strength if be to collapse under communist pressure from the north the progress in the rest of asia would be greatly endanger and do not forget that the third reason be what happen in south|vietnam will determine yes will determine whether ambitious and aggressive nation can use guerrilla warfare to conquer weak neighbor will determine whether may make right now do not know of a single more important reason for presence than this be fight in south|vietnam a different kind of war than have ever know in the past sixteen|years|ago|this|month north|korea attack south|korea by armed invasion across a national border a communist country attempt to conquer and overrun neighbor the|united|states|of|america recognize this kind of aggression immediately and act north|korean aggression fail why because president harry|s.|truman and the american people work with the force of the|united|nation support that great leader have the courage to help the people of south|korea protect home and protect country those people be help in vietnam now today south|korea be still free and thousand of young man be again fight side by side with the americans to defend another small country from be swallow up by a more powerful communist neighbor today in south|vietnam be witness to another kind of armed aggression be a war that be wag by man who believe that subversion and guerrilla warfare transport across international boundary can achieve what conventional army could not believe that in the long run a modern scientific and industrial nation such as be helpless to defend a small and weak country against the import terror of guerrilla warfare that be what be go on there the communist guerrilla the vietcong choose target carefully aim at the heart of a struggle nation by murder the schoolteacher by murder the agricultural extension worker by kill the health worker by assassinate the mayor and family in alone the communists kill or kidnap south|vietnamese civilian that be equivalent to wipe out the entire population of columbus nebraska or or out of every citizen that live in this great city of omaha if by such method the agent of nation can go out and hold and seize power where turbulent change be occur in another nation hope for peace and order will suffer a crush blow all over the world will be an invitation to the would be conqueror to keep on march that be why the problem of guerrilla warfare the problem of vietnam be a very critical threat to peace not just in south|vietnam but in all of this world in which live let there be no doubt about those who say this be merely a south|vietnamese civil war could not be more wrong the warfare in south|vietnam be start by the government|of|north|vietnam in be finance be support by an increase flow of man and arm from the north into the south be direct and be lead by a skilled professional staff of north|vietnamese and be support by a very small minority of the population of south|vietnam the military tactic be different the nature of the fighting be different but the objective be the same as find in korea the objective be what the objective be to conquer an independent nation by the force and power of arm may make right so think these communist invader well the war take a new turn in the|north|vietnamese decide to step up the conflict in the hope of an early victory recruit and draft more young man from the communist area in the south slip across the border of south|vietnam more|than|three division of today there be more|than|three north|vietnamese division fight in south|vietnam build all weather road the trail turn into boulevard to replace the jungle trail that have once use begin send troop in by truck rather than on foot shift over to heavy weapon use import ammunition most of come from communist china by any definition want to use any definition any lawyer can tell this this be armed aggression the philosophy that may make right well america 's purpose be to convince north|vietnam that this kind of aggression be too costly that this kind of power can not succeed have learn from prisoner defector and capture document that the hanoi government really think a|few|months|ago that conquest be in grasp but the free man have rally to prevent this conquest from succeed in the|past|15|month action and those of fight ally of korea australia new|zealand and the philippines and the courage of the people of south|vietnam have already begin to turn the tide the casualty of the vietcong and the north|vietnamese force be time large than those of the south|vietnamese and ally battle after battle be be win by the|south|vietnamese and by the troop under that gallant leader from the|united|states|of|america general westy westmoreland be get some military advice on the side from some of armchair general in the|united|state but look to like be do pretty good use own judgment the air attack on military target in north|vietnam have impose and will continue to impose a grow burden and a high price on those who wage war against the freedom of neighbor in the south the vietnamese be determine that own economic development own social reform and political progress can not wait until the war end so be now move toward constitutional government for the|past|2|month the political struggle in south|vietnam have be dramatize in newspaper have be publish on television screen every day but all during this time the vietnamese citizen represent every important group in the society have be quietly meet in orderly assembly have formulate rule for election the rule have be accept with only minor modification by the government in saigon and in the province and village the vietnamese have go on building school for child improve health facility and agricultural method and take the first step toward land reform so can take heart from all of this be back the vietnamese not only in determination to save country be support determination to build to construct a modern society in which the government will be government reflect the will of the people of south|vietnam objective in vietnam be not war objective be peace there be nothing that want in north|vietnam there be nothing want from north|vietnam there be nothing that want in communist china there be nothing the american people want from communist china have make very clear by every mean at disposal that wish the killing to stop have make very clear that wish negotiation to begin on the basis of international agreement make in and for halt bombing in the north in the hope that the government in hanoi would signal willingness to talk instead of fight but regret to tell that no signal come during those|37|day in many more way than can now tell here in omaha have explore and be continue to explore avenue to peace with north|vietnam but as of this moment only reply have be to send more troop and to send more gun into the south until the|day decide to end this aggression and to make an honorable peace can assure that speak for the|united|states|of|america intend to carry on no one know how long will take only hanoi can be the judge of that no one can tell how much effort will take none can tell how much sacrifice will take no one can tell how costly will be but can and do here and now tell this the aggression that be conduct will not succeed the people of south|vietnam will be give the chance to work out own destiny in own way and not at the point of a bayonet or with a gun at temple hear friend say be troubled be confused be frustrated and all of can understand those people sometimes almost develop a stomach ulcer just listen to all wish the war would end all wish the troop would come home but want to see the alternative and the calculation that have to present that give a well chance to get the troop home than the very thing be do there be no human being in all this world who wish these thing to happen for peace to come to the world more than president of the|united|state if be too busy or not inclined to help please count before hurt because must have no doubt today about the determination of the american man wear american uniform the marines who be out there fight in the wet jungle wade through the rice paddie up to belt the sailor who be search the shore and patrol the sea the airman who be out there face the missile and the antiaircraft gun carry out mission try to protect liberty the least be entitle to be for to be as brave as be and to stand up and give the support need here at home these man be not go to fail

thank transcript mr. secretary lady and gentleman be very pleased to address the|foreign|service|institute this|morning and to come here to meet with so many americans that be prepare to serve country abroad as who believe that can not shorten reach in the world be greatly encourage by the number and the quality of those who be study at this institute have the gratitude of countryman and own assurance of support have come a long way from the|day that someone observe that some diplomat no doubt will launch a heedless word and lurk war leap out that be more|than|half|a|century|ago when diplomacy be often war by another name today task be different those of about to go abroad represent a continuity of purpose in a generation of change that purpose be to build from reason and moderation a world order in which the fire of conflict yield to the fulfillment of man 's old yearning for and family job wherever serve be peace that be the task that face all of today the question as always be how how do for example maintain the security of the atlantic community upon which so many of the world 's hope depend for the answer must begin with the gray dawn of the world of when europe 's city lie in rubble farm devastate industry smash people weary with war and death and defeat now from that desolation have come abundance from that weakness have come power from those ashe of holocaust have come the rebirth of a strong and a vital community the europe of today be a new europe in place of uncertainty there be confidence in place of decay progress in place of isolation partnership in place of war peace if there be no single explanation for the difference between europe then and europe now there be a pattern be a luminous design that be weave through the history of the|past|20|year be the design of common action of interdependent institution serve the good of the european nation as though be all be the design of collective security protect the entire atlantic community so have come here this|morn to speak to of important part of that design speak of a structure that some of have help to build the|north|atlantic|treaty|organization let make clear in the beginning that do not believe there be any righteousness in stand pat if an organization be alive and vital if be to have meaning for all time as well as for any particular time must grow and respond and yield to change like constitution which make the law of the land the|north|atlantic|treaty be more than just a legal document be the foundation of a living institution that institution be nato the organization create to give meaning and reality to the alliance commitment the crowded month which immediately precede and follow the conclusion of the|north|atlantic|treaty have produce an atmosphere of crisis be a crisis that be bear of deep fear fear for europe 's economic and political vitality fear of communist aggression fear of communist subversion some say that new circumstance in the world today call for the dismantling of this great organization of course nato should adapt to the change need of the time but believe just as firmly that such change must be work by the member nation work with another within the alliance consultation not isolation be the route to reform must not forget either in success or abundance the lesson that have learn in danger and in isolation that whatever the issue that share have common danger division and common safety unity what be view of nato today see not as an alliance to make war but as an alliance to keep peace through an era as turbulent as man have ever know and under the constant threat of ultimate destruction nato have insure the security of the north|atlantic community have reinforce stability elsewhere throughout the world while nato rest on the reality that must fight together if war should come to the atlantic area rest also on the reality that war will not come if act together during peace be the foreign minister of france who in insist that to be truly secure europe need not only help in resist attack but help in prevent attack liberation say be not enough the success of nato have be measure by many yardstick the most significant to be the most obvious war have be deter through the common organization have weld the military contribution of each of the ally into a very effective instrument so convincing be this instrument that potential aggressor take stock and count as too high the price of satisfy ambition have be prove true that sword keep another in the sheath war have be deter not only because of integrate military power but because of the political unity of purpose to which that power have be direct and bent be difficult to overstate the importance of the bond of culture of political institution tradition and value which form the bedrock of the atlantic community there be here a political integrity and an identity of interest that transcend personality and issue of the moment if collective effort should falter and common determination be erode the foundation of the atlantic 's present stability would certainly be shake the mighty arsenal in the world will deter no aggressor who know that victim be too divide to decide and too unready to respond that be the lesson that learn from world war yet a nation not by the action of friend but by own decision to prepare and plan alone could still imperil own security by create a situation in which response would be too late and too diluted every advance in the technology of war make more unacceptable the old and narrow concept of sovereignty no one today can doubt the necessity of prevent war be firm conviction that collective action through nato be the good assurance that war will be deter in the atlantic world look at the atlantic community through the eye of those who in year past have yearn for conquest the sight be sobering integrated command common plan force in be in advance of an emergency for use in any emergency all of these testify to a collective readiness and the integrity of collective purpose to other eye nato can only be a clear warning of the folly of aggression nato today therefore must be shape on the experience of the past reliance on independent action by separate force only loosely coordinate with joint force and plan twice lead to world war before but collective action have prove successful in deter war since -during|20|year of upheaval and grave danger reject those experience only at own peril for part be determined to join with of other ally to preserve and to strengthen the deterrent strength of nato will urge that those principle of joint and common preparation be extend wherever can be usefully apply in be hopeful that no member of the treaty will long remain withdraw from the mutual affair and obligation of the atlantic a place of respect and responsibility will await any ally who decide to return to the common task for the world be still full of peril for those who prize and cherish liberty peril and opportunity these bountiful land that be wash by the atlantic this half people that be unmatched in arm and industry this cradle of common value and splendid vision this measureless storehouse of wealth can enrich the life of an entire planet be this strength of idea as well as strength of arm of peaceful purpose as well as power that offer such hope for the reconciliation of western|europe with the people of to surrender that strength now by isolation from another would be to dim the promise of that|day when the man and woman of all europe shall again move freely among each other be not a question of wealth alone be a question of heart and mind be a willingness to leave forever those national rivalry which so often lead to the useless squandering of life and treasure in war be a question of the deep spirit of unity of which nato be but a symbol that unity be never better express than when at the conclusion of the|north|atlantic|treaty in a great french leader declare that nation be more and more convinced that fate be closely bind together that salvation and welfare must rest upon the progressive application of human solidarity and be to the preservation of human solidarity that all of effort today should be direct so let all of of the|foreign|service|institute make task as well as thank and

man be never so likely to settle a question rightly as when discuss freely be united in commitment to free discussion so also be united in determination that no foe anywhere should ever mistake argument for indecision nor debate for weakness so what be the question that be still be ask first some ask if this be a war for unlimited objective the answer be plain the answer be no purpose in vietnam be to prevent the success of aggression be not conquest be not empire be not foreign basis be not domination be simply put just to prevent the forceful conquest of south|vietnam by north|vietnam some people ask if be catch in a blind escalation of force that be pull headlong toward a wide war that no one want the answer again be a simple no be use that force and only that force that be necessary to stop this aggression fighting man be in vietnam because tens|of|thousand of invader come south before number have increase in vietnam because the aggression of other have increase in vietnam the high hope of the aggressor have be dim and the tide of the battle have be turn and measure use of force will and must be continue but this be prudent firmness under what believe be careful control there be not and there will not be a mindless escalation third other ask if fighting man be to be deny the help need the answer again be and will be a resounding no great military establishment have move man across since last|spring these man have and will have all need to fight the aggressor have already perform miracle in combat and the man behind have work miracle of supply

army of red|china and again the answer be no never by any act of and not if there be any reason leave behind the wild word from peking have threaten no one and will not seek the end of no regime and will not purpose be solely to defend against aggression to any armed attack will reply have measure the strength and the weakness of other and think know own observe in and applaud in other a careful restraint in action can live with anger in word as long as be match by caution in deed sixth man ask if rely on gun alone still again the answer be no from honolulu meeting from the clear pledge which join with ally in saigon there have emerge a common dedication to the peaceful progress of the people of vietnam to school for child to care for health to hope and bounty for land the vice president

wisdom to be ready americans must understand how fundamental be the meaning of this second war the war on want talk on ranch last|fall with secretary freeman secretary of agriculture and in office last|week with secretary gardner secretary of health,|education and welfare make over and over again the same central point the breeding ground of war be human misery if be not to fight forever in

that obedience to the law be a fact of life to so many man and woman of good will throughout the south on another front here in lovely nation 's capital city--"the sovereignty of self govern people be still unresolved the people of the|district|of|columbia think deserve and think must and will have home rule be an irony and disgrace that have extend self government already to the|philippine|island and to puerto|rico have enthusiastically recommend democratic principle to nation around the world nation after nation after have welcome alaska and hawaii as new states that somehow some people seem to be afraid to trust almost|a|million american citizen with the management of own affair here in congress be move to redeem this disgrace the senate as on at|least|five different occasion in the past have act to pass a good home rule bill contain a solid and a workable charter for home rule that bill should come before the|house|of|representatives very shortly the limit of reasonable delay have long since be reach and pass no one doubt the outcome once that bill finally get to the floor of the house and the member be permit to vote on but what be need this|morning be a commitment by the leadership and by the member of both party if please to the only practical mean of get the bill on the floor and that seem to be the petition to discharge the|house|district|committee from further delay of the bill bill have be pende before that committee for year after year after year so have as president urge the speaker of the|house|of|representatives mr. mccormack and the other leader and member of own party to lead the way in this movement but to all of those who believe in party elective system to all of those who believe in taxation with representation to those who believe in keep faith with own people express the hope that too will join in this effort be now ready to take any question that may have to ask q. mr. president the steel negotiator still seem to be considerably apart on an agreement and a strike be threaten within a|week would care to comment on that situation the president yes think that the steel situation be on almost every citizen 's mind in this country the decision which will be make in pittsburgh this|week be of vital importance to every person in this country and to people in other part of the world there must be continue cost and price stability in american economy and expect full and complete responsibility in the current wage negotiation and expect continue stability in steel price as meet here today be troubled with many question but must never forget that boy be still fight in south|viet nam and that economic strength be the keystone of free world peace be extremely important to the security that hold very dear so the decision that will be make this|week by steel management and by labor in the|day that be ahead must certainly take into account the overall great national interest which be involve the director of the|federal|mediation|service of most trust public servant mr. william|simkin be in pittsburgh and be there for the purpose of make every contribution can to assist the party in reach a responsible agreement the eye of this country be on the leader of both management and labor be expect and believe will receive the responsibility which the national interest requires.6 q. mr. president in world|war|ii there be notable air strike which completely knock out in single raid vast industrial complex and transportation facility yet in the war in viet nam read from over there of repeat case of where take several raid to demobilize or deactivate certain industrial installation be think of the powerplant be hit yesterday over and over and such thing as bridge be current inability to knock out some of these big industrial complex or railroad staging area or bridge be this a purposeful thing to avoid saturation bombing or be there any other explanation the president no think that operation have be up to expectation think a review and evaluation of will reflect that have be rather effective and think that be in keep with the planned purpose of mission q. mr. president do think the so call white paper issue by house republicans under the leadership of congressman ford have inject undue partisanship into the viet nam situation the president well do not want to get into any personality in the matter think the issue of war and peace in viet nam be far great than any personal difference that one may have for that matter far great than any party 's have say on many occasion and should like to repeat to the american people and to hanoi also that be very pleased with the support the american people be give to the policy of government both at home and abroad while man be fight and die for freedom in south|viet nam be go to do everything that can to support those man and to unite the country behind think that generally speak the country be unite behind and think this will be a source of strength to boy out there have receive excellent cooperation from the leadership of both party in the past and expect to continue in the future the boy that be fight the war be not divide between republicans and democrats the man direct the strategy involve do not know what party belong to the distinguished secretary of defense before come into government be a member of a party different from the president with whom counsel often and who have have the great experience in not only political and diplomatic matter but in matter of a military nature president eisenhower have be a tower of strength to to the|joint|chiefs|of|staff to the secretary of defense and to the leader of the congress so would say that welcome expression of viewpoint from the leadership in both party there will be time when do not see everything alike but that may contribute strength to system do not think that hanoi should ever for a moment entertain the illusion that the people of this country be not united in the work of this government q. the congressional session be almost over and what be the prospect of the immigration bill pass and could assess for some of the long range effect of if pass the president do not know how good a prophet be have put this legislation very high in list think be extremely important have continually urge the leadership to proceed with this consideration the house have under study now have talk to the speaker at length yesterday and again today be send a letter later|today express very strongly the view of the executive branch of the government again be hope that that bill will pass as report by the|house|judiciary|committee without crippling amendment have not be act upon yet by the|senate|judiciary|committee believe that should be act on before the congress get out of here favor the house bill think will result in a great improvement not only in relation with other nation but will be very satisfying to large segment of own people believe will pass would like to have the help of all of though in that connection q. mr. president do believe that the guideline of administration and mr. kennedy 's administration lay down on wage and price stability apply to federal employee and if so do believe that the civilian pay raise bill now report out of the house committee violate those guideline the president would think that the|federal|government have a different situation from what have in certain segment of private sector but would hope that would never ask for privilege for in government that would not expect private industry to share in therefore when make allowance for the difference in public and private employment and the various policy and fringe benefit would hope that could keep civilian pay structure in line with the guideline that recommend for private industry do think the house bill go too far do think that would violate the guideline do hope that the congress will carefully and thoroughly consider the destructive effect would have if should pass the bill in present form have a most distinguished panel of most distinguished americans study this whole subject make recommendation would hope that the congress would enact those recommendation with certain modification that think be require but certainly not go anywhere near the overall recommendation make by the house committee because think that would be very disastrous to price wage stability policy in this country and think would violate the guideline q. mr. president get back to viet nam for a moment the other night on television some of top adviser speak in a way that seem rather pointed about the agreement as a possible basis for a new agreement do this reflect an administration emphasis and do reflect a feeling that perhaps somebody be listen to now sir the president think that be always hopeful that all the world be aware of desire for discussion and desire for negotiation and desire for peace do not think be really important how much extra get an hour in steel contract or what the increase of federal pay be if boy be go to be draft tomorrow and go to be call upon to give life in viet nam so peace peace

people what be go on here what be go on in the world so can be fully inform and think that make for a more united country q. mr. president of late sir have be able to detect any military advantage in viet nam have turn the corner there after have go apparently so bad for so long the president be always hesitant to make a prophecy about how good thing be or how bad be because fellow have a way of remember what a public official say way back there and feed up to from time to time but think must be evident to that marines and other soldier in the army and the man in the navy and the|air|force have be give a good account of and work very closely with the dedicated and patriotic and determined south|vietnamese always associate with and work with have be quite effective in the|last|few|week as tell in last meeting plead with cabinet every time see say to secretary mcnamara be sure that man have the morale and have the equipment and have the necessary mean of see that keep commitment in viet nam and have the strength to do say to mr. rusk while be work with right hand on strength and stability there and do the job be committed to do and mr. goldberg and the rest of use that leave hand and be sure that do everything to get away from the battlefield and back at the conference table if that be possible so be like a man in a ring be use right and left constantly q. seem increasingly possible mr. president that the conflict between indonesia and malaysia could erupt into an earthquake that would affect southeast asia far more gravely than anything that be go on in viet nam today would assess that danger for include the point as to whether think be possible to keep indonesia from completely go into the communist chinese orbit the president would agree that the whole situation there be very delicate a matter that require constant watching secretary of state be do that the president be do have recently send to indonesia of most train and trust diplomat be go to make every contribution that can to try to preserve peace in that area think that what be do in south|viet nam have a very important bearing on the whole sector of that part of the world would not want to make any prophecy as to what the final outcome would be other than will be hopeful and will be continue in effort to contribute anything can to a peaceful solution q. mr. president sir veto the military construction bill the|other|day and say do because be repugnant to the constitution some people disagree with think that very clearly while power be limit by the constitution the power of congress be extensive would refer to section|8|of|the|constitution where say that congress will make all the rule for government and regulation of the land and naval force do not think may reconsider that the president well first review that veto message very carefully late|in|the|even of the last day with most of good legal adviser the statement as remember say that the attorney general inform that be repugnant to the constitution so would refer first to the attorney general and know would be glad to give great weight to any observation may have agree with the attorney general hope the congress will share that view think that do owe the congress a reasonable reporting procedure indicate in message that would willingly make those report if could be work out where would not adversely affect military posture or duty as commander in chief genuinely believe that the bill in the form that veto do considerably restrain the commander in chief and be not in the national interest thank mr. president & nbsp & nbsp view transcript transcript mr. vice president mr. speaker members of congress member of the cabinet distinguished guest fellow americans today be a triumph for freedom as huge as any victory that have ever be win on any battlefield yet to seize the meaning of this|day must recall dark time three|and|a|half|centuries|ago the first negroes arrive at jamestown do not arrive in brave ship in search of a home for freedom do not mingle fear and joy in expectation that in this new world anything would be possible to a man strong enough to reach for come in darkness and come in chain and today strike away the last major shackle of those fierce and ancient bond today the negro story and the american story fuse and blend and let remember that be not always so the story of nation and of the|american|negro be like great river well up from that tiny jamestown|spring flow through the century along divided channel when pioneer subdue a continent to the need of man do not tame for the negro when the|liberty|bell rang out in philadelphia do not toll for the negro when andrew|jackson throw open the door of democracy do not open for the negro be only at appomattox a|century|ago that an american victory be also a negro victory and the river shin with promise the other dark stain with oppression begin to move toward one another yet for almost|a|century the promise of that|day be not fulfil today be a towering and certain mark that in this generation that promise will be keep in time the current will finally mingle and rush as great stream across the uncertain and the|marvelous|years of the america that be yet to come this act flow from a clear and simple wrong only purpose be to right that wrong million of americans be deny the right to vote because of color this law will ensure the right to vote the wrong be which no american in heart can justify the right be which no american true to principle can deny in as the leader of the majority in the|united|states|senate speak in support of legislation to guarantee the right of all man to vote say this right to vote be the basic right without which all other be meaningless give people people as individual control over own destiny last|year say until every qualified person regardless of the color of skin have the right unquestioned and unrestrained to go in and cast ballot in every precinct in this great land of be not go to be satisfied immediately after the election direct the attorney general to explore as rapidly as possible the way to ensure the right to vote and then last|march with the outrage of selma still fresh come down to this capitol one|evening and ask the congress and the people for swift and for sweep action to guarantee to every man and woman the right to vote in less|than|48|hour send the|voting|rights|act of to the congress in little|more|than|4|month the congress with overwhelming majority enact of the most monumental law in the entire history of american freedom the member of the congress and the many private citizen who work to shape and pass this bill will share a place of honor in history for this act alone there be those who say this be an old injustice and there be no need to hurry but have pass since the 15th amendment give all negroes the right to vote and the time for wait be go there be those who say small and more gradual measure should be try but have be try for year and year have be try and try and try and have fail and fail and fail and the time for failure be go there be those who say that this be a many sided and very complex problem but however view the denial of the right to vote be still a deadly wrong and the time for injustice have go this law cover many page but the heart of the act be plain wherever by clear and objective standard state and county be use regulation or law or test to deny the right to vote then will be strike down if be clear that state official still intend to discriminate then federal examiner will be send in to register all eligible voter when the prospect of discrimination be go the examiner will be immediately withdraw and under this act if any county anywhere in this nation do not want federal intervention nee only open polling place to all of people this good congress the 89th congress act swiftly in pass this act intend to act with equal dispatch in enforce this act and tomorrow at the attorney general have be direct to file a lawsuit challenge the constitutionality of the poll tax in the|state|of|mississippi this will begin the legal process which confidently believe will very soon prohibit any state from require the payment of money in order to exercise the fight to vote and also by tomorrow the|justice|department through publication in the|federal|register will have officially certify the states where discrimination exist have in addition request the|department|of|justice to work all through this|weekend so that on monday|morn next can designate many county where past experience clearly show that federal action be necessary and require and by tuesday morning train federal examiner will be at work register eligible man and woman in 10|to|15 county and on that same day next|tuesday additional poll tax suit will be file in of texas alabama and virginia and pledge that will not delay or will not hesitate or will not turn aside until americans of every race and color and origin in this country have the same right as all other to share in the process of democracy so through this act and enforcement an important instrument of freedom pass into the hand of million of citizen but that instrument must be use president and congresses law and lawsuit can open the door to the polling place and open the door to the wondrous reward which await the wise use of the ballot but only the individual negro and all other who have be deny the right to vote can really walk through those door and can use that right and can transform the vote into an instrument of justice and fulfillment so let now say to every negro in this country must register must vote must learn so choice advance interest and the interest of beloved nation future and child 's future depend upon and do not believe that be go to let down this act be not only a victory for negro leadership this act be a great challenge to that leadership be a challenge which can not be meet simply by protest and demonstration mean that dedicated leader must work around the clock to teach people right and responsibility and to lead to exercise those right and to fulfill those responsibility and those duty to country if do this then will find as other have find before that the vote be the most powerful instrument ever devise by man for break down injustice and destroy the terrible wall which imprison man because be different from other man today what be perhaps the last of the legal barrier be tumble there will be many action and many difficulty before the right weave into law be also weave into the fabric of nation but the struggle for equality must now move toward a different battlefield be nothing less than grant every american|negro freedom to enter the mainstream of american life not the conformity that blur enrich difference of culture and tradition but rather the opportunity that give each a chance to choose for century of oppression and hatred have already take painful toll can be see throughout land in man without skill in child without father in family that be imprison in slum and in poverty for be not enough just to give man right must be able to use those right in personal pursuit of happiness the wound and the weakness the outward wall and the inward scar which diminish achievement be the work of american society must all now help to end â€” help to end through expand program already devise and through new one to search out and forever end the special handicap of those who be black in a nation that happen to be mostly white so be for this purpose to fulfill the right that now secure that have already call a white|house conference to meet here in the nation 's capital this|fall so will move step by step â€” often painfully but think with clear vision along the path toward american freedom be difficult to fight for freedom but also know how difficult can be to bend long year of habit and custom to grant there be no room for injustice anywhere in the american mansion but there be always room for understanding toward those who see the old way crumble and to today say simply this must come be right that should come and when have will find that a burden have be lift from shoulder too be not just a question of guilt although there be that be that man can not live with a lie and not be stain by the central fact of american civilization so hard for other to understand â€” be that freedom and justice and the dignity of man be not just word to believe in under all the growth and the tumult and abundance believe and so as long as some among be oppress and be part of that oppression must blunt faith and sap the strength of high purpose thus this be a victory for the freedom of the|american|negro but be also a victory for the freedom of the|american|nation and every family across this great entire search land will live strong in liberty will live more splendid in expectation and will be prouder to be american because of the act that have pass that will sign today thank view transcript transcript the president fellow americans not long ago receive a letter from a woman in the midwest write dear mr. president in humble way be write to about the crisis in viet nam have a son who be now in viet nam husband serve in world|war|ii country be at war but now this time be just something that do not understand why well have try to answer that question dozen of time and more in practically every state in this union have discuss fully in baltimore in april in washington in may in san|francisco in june let again now discuss here in of the|white|house why must young americans bear into a land exultant with hope and with golden promise toil and suffer and sometimes die in such a remote and distant place the answer like the war be not an easy one but echo clearly from the painful lesson of half|a|century time in lifetime in world wars and in korea americans have go to far land to fight for freedom have learn at a terrible and a brutal cost that retreat do not bring safety and weakness do not bring peace be this lesson that have bring to viet nam this be a different kind of war there be no march army or solemn declaration some citizen of south|viet nam at time with understandable grievance have join in the attack on own government but must not let this mask the central fact that this be really war be guide by north|viet nam and be spur by communist china goal be to conquer the south to defeat american power and to extend the asiatic dominion of communism there be great stake in the balance most of the non - communist nation of asia can not by and alone resist the grow might and the grasp ambition of asian communism power therefore be a very vital shield if be drive from the field in viet nam then no nation can ever again have the same confidence in american promise or in american protection in each land the force of independence would be considerably weaken and an asia so threaten by communist domination would certainly imperil the security of the|united|state do not choose to be the guardian at the gate but there be no one else nor would surrender in viet nam bring peace because learn from hitler at munich that success only feed the appetite of aggression the battle would be renew in country and then another country bring with perhaps even large and crueler conflict as have learn from the lesson of history moreover be in viet nam to fulfill of the most solemn pledge of the|american|nation president president eisenhower president kennedy and present president over 11|year have commit and have promise to help defend this small and valiant nation strengthen by that promise the people of south|viet nam have fight for many long year thousand of have die thousand more have be cripple and scar by war just can not now dishonor word or abandon commitment or leave those who believe and who trust to the terror and repression and murder that would follow this then fellow americans be why be in viet nam fellow americans once again in man 's age old struggle for a well life and a world of peace the wisdom courage and compassion of the american people be be put to the test this be the meaning of the tragic conflict in vietnam in meet the present challenge be essential that people seek understanding and that leader speak with candor have therefore direct that this report to the american people be compile and widely distribute in page will find statement on vietnam by leader of government by president secretary of state and secretary of defense these statement be prepare for different audience and reflect the differ responsibility of each speaker the congressional testimony have be edit to avoid undue repetition and to incorporate the sense of the discussion that ensue together construct a clear definition of america 's role in the vietnam conflict danger and hope that vietnam hold for all free man --the fullness and limit of national objective in a war do not seek --the constant effort on part to bring this war do not desire to a quick and honorable end what be goal in that war strain land first intend to convince the communists that can not be defeat by force of arm or by superior power be not easily convince in recent|month have greatly increase fighting force and attack and the number of incident have ask the|commanding|general general|westmoreland what more need to meet this mount aggression have tell will meet need have today order to viet nam the|air|mobile|division and certain other force which will raise fighting strength from to man almost immediately additional force will be need later and will be send as request this will make necessary to increase active fighting force by raise the monthly draft call from over a period of time to per month and for to step up campaign for voluntary enlistment after this|past|week of deliberation have conclude that be not essential to order reserve unit into service now if that necessity should later be indicate will give the matter most careful consideration and will give the country an adequate notice before take such action but only after full preparation have also discuss with the|government|of|south|viet nam lately the step that will take to substantially increase own effort both on the battlefield and toward reform and progress in the village ambassador lodge be now formulate a new program to be test upon return to that area have direct secretary rusk and secretary mcnamara to be available immediately to the congress to review with these committee the appropriate congressional committee what plan to do in these area have ask to be able to answer the question of any member of congress secretary mcnamara in addition will ask the|senate|appropriations|committee to add a limited amount to present legislation to help meet part of this new cost until a supplemental measure be ready and hearing can be hold when the congress assemble in january in the meantime will use the authority contain in the present defense appropriation bill under consideration to transfer fund in addition to the additional money that will ask these step like action in the past be carefully measure to do what must be do to bring an end to aggression and a peaceful settlement do not want an expand struggle with consequence that no one can perceive nor will bluster or bully or flaunt power but will not surrender and will not retreat for behind american pledge lie the determination and resource believe of all of the|american|nation once the communists know as know that a violent solution be impossible then a peaceful solution be inevitable be ready now as have always be to move from the battlefield to the conference table have state publicly and many time again and again america 's willingness to begin unconditional discussion with any government at any place at any time effort have be make to start these discussion with the help of nation throughout the world but there have be no answer but be go to continue to persist if persist must until death and desolation have lead to the same conference table where other could now join at a much small cost have speak many time of objective in viet nam so have the|government|of|south|viet nam hanoi have set forth own proposal be ready to discuss proposal and proposal and any proposal of any government whose people may be affect for fear the meeting room no more than fear the battlefield in this pursuit welcome and ask for the concern and the assistance of any nation and all nation if the|united|nation and official or any of member can by deed or word private initiative or public action bring nearer an honorable peace then will have the support and the gratitude of have direct ambassador goldberg to go to new|york today and to present immediately to secretary general u|thant a letter from request that all the resource energy and immense prestige of the|united|nation be employ to find way to halt aggression and to bring peace in viet nam make a similar request at san|francisco a|few|weeks|ago because do not seek the destruction of any government nor do covet a foot of any territory but insist and will always insist that the people of south|viet nam shall have the right of choice the right to shape own destiny in free election in the south or throughout all viet nam under international supervision and shall not have any government impose upon by force and terror so long as can prevent this be the purpose of the agreement which the communists have now cruelly shatter if the machinery of those agreement be tragically weak purpose still guide action as battle rage will continue as best can to help the good people of south|viet nam enrich the condition of life to feed the hungry and to tend the sick and teach the young and shelter the homeless and to help the farmer to increase crop and the worker to find a job be an ancient but still terrible irony that while many leader of man create division in pursuit of grand ambition the child of man be really united in the simple elusive desire for a life of fruitful and rewarding toil as say at johns|hopkins in baltimore hope that one|day can help all the people of asia toward that desire eugene|black have make great progress since appearance in baltimore in that direction not as the price of peace for be ready always to bear a more painful cost but rather as a part of obligation of justice toward fellow man let also add now a personal note do not find easy to send the flower of youth fine young man into battle have speak to today of the division and the force and the battalion and the unit but know all every have see in a street of a town in every state in this union work and laugh and building and fill with hope and life think know too how mother weep and how family sorrow this be the most agonizing and the most painful duty of president there be something else too when be young poverty be so common that do not know have a name an education be something that have to fight for and water be really life have now be in public life 35|year more|than|three|decade and in each of those|35|years have see good man and wise leader struggle to bring the blessing of this land to all of people and now be the president be now opportunity to help every child get an education to help every negro and every american citizen have an equal opportunity to have every family get a decent home and to help bring healing to the sick and dignity to the old as have say before that be what have live for that be what have want all life since be a little boy and do not want to see all those hope and all those dream of so many people for so|many|year now drown in the wasteful ravage of cruel war be go to do all can do to see that that never happen but also know as a realistic public servant that as long as there be man who hate and destroy must have the courage to resist or will see all all that have build all that hope to build all of dream for freedom all all will be sweep away on the flood of conquest so too this shall not happen will stand in viet nam now what america be and be and hope to stand for as an important national asset tell the truth to this world tell an exciting story be the|voice|of|america classify

be too successful know of nothing that have in mind that should arouse the distrust or provoke any violence on the part of the|soviet|union q. mr. president do the fact that be send additional force to viet nam imply any change in the exist policy of rely mainly on the|south|vietnamese to carry out offensive operation and use american force to guard american installation and to act as an emergency backup the president do not imply any change in policy whatever do not imply any change of objective q. mr. president would like to see the|united|nation now move formally as an organization to attempt to achieve a settlement in viet nam the president have make very clear in san|francisco speech hope that the secretary general under wise leadership would explore every possibility that may lead to a solution of this matter in letter to the secretary general this|morning which ambassador goldberg will deliver later|in|the|day reiterate hope and desire and urge upon that if agree that undertake new effort in this direction ambassador goldberg understand the challenge spend the|weekend talk about the potentiality and the possibility hope and dream and believe that will have an able advocate and a search negotiator who would hope would some|day find success q. mr. president what be the border of power to conduct a war at what point may have to ask congress for a declaration the president do not know that would depend on the circumstance can not pinpoint the date on the calendar or the|hour|of|the|day have to ask congress for judgment and for decision almost|every|hour|of|the|day of the principal duty of the office of president be to maintain constant consultation have talk to guess more|than|50 members of congress in the|last|24|hours have submit to question and the secretary of state and the secretary of defense will meet with tomorrow if be ready to answer any question that may need up to now have have ample authority excellent cooperation a united congress behind and as near as could tell from meeting last|night with the leader and from meeting today with the distinguished chairman of the committee and the member of both party all meet as americans unite and determine to stand as q. mr. president in this connection however last|night of the lead governors of the republicans say some rather strong thing governor hatfield of oregon say the most recent escalation of action in viet nam be move all the people of the world closer to world war iii and have no moral right to commit the world and especially own people to world war iii unilaterally or by the decision of a few expert this seem to imply rather strong criticism of present policy do care to express any reaction the president yes do not interpret that way think that there be danger in escalation do not think have any right to commit the whole world to world war iii be do everything know how to avoid but retreat be not necessarily the good way to avoid have

soviet response be an encouraging development as have state before peace be the lead item on the agenda of mankind and every effort should be make to lead toward that goal as state in san|francisco will come to these next negotiation with proposal for effective attack on these deadly danger to mankind and hope that other will do the same now be prepared to take question q. mr. president in statement about the situation in viet nam sir refer to the necessity for maintain adequate reserve and adequate equipment wonder sir in view of the increase fighting and the increase manpower commitment be give any thought be the government give any thought first to call up additional reserves or second to increase draft call the president the government be always consider every possibility and every eventuality no decision have be make in connection with the reserve or increase draft call will be in a well position to act upon matter of that kind after the secretary return from trip q. mr. president could tell whether governor harriman 's trip to moscow have any connection with the soviet position in viet nam the president think that the governor have best explain that trip by say be a vacation that be on the wire today be not an official government trip be not send there by the president although the governor be a man of a wide range of interest and experience approve heartily of statement that would be glad to visit with any people that care to visit with be a personal trip and a vacation trip in nature q. mr. president what do think in judgment be the chance at this time of avoid a major land war in asia the president do not think that anyone can prophesy what will happen from day to day or week to week or month|to|month think be well for to remember that president have make the pledge for this nation that the senate have ratify the seato treaty by a vote of to pledge the|united|state to come to the aid of any nation upon request who be party to that treaty or protocol president eisenhower make first commitment there in that be reaffirm by president kennedy many time in different way the present president have reiterate the stand of the|united|state that expect to keep that commitment national honor be at stake word be at stake and must be obvious to all americans that would not want the president of country to follow any course that be inconsistent with commitment or with national honor q. mr. president sir in view of the situation in north|viet nam and south|viet nam be think of continue the plan for a merger of reserves and the|national|guard the president so far as be aware the situation there have no effect on the merger way or the other q. would not affect the efficiency of force the president be contend that the merger would improve the efficiency but do not think that be a matter that would be consider in connection with what happen out there way or the other q. mr. president could give a status report on the|air|force 's man orbit laboratory and specifically whether intend to give a go ahead and if so when the president no be not in a position to make a statement on that at this time the|space|council have have some briefing in connection with the matter there be a study go on every|day in that connection but would not want to go further than that now q. mr. president in view of the|disarmament|conference and the soviet response and ambassador harriman 's conversation with the|soviet|union could give assessment of the soviet american relation as stand now could give a temperature reading the president be very anxious to maintain close relation with the|soviet|union and have feel that considerable progress have be make in unfortunately the situation that develop in north|viet nam have place a strain on those relation regret very deeply but have feel that as say earlier national honor require to pursue the course of conduct that have follow will be look for every opportunity that can to work with the|soviet|union in the interest of peace think that the resumption of the|disarmament|conference be step in that direction would like to improve the relation any way can q. mr. president tell last|week sir that thing in viet nam will probably get bad before can get well and today indicate that will probably send a lot more force there than have now can give any appraisal as to how many or be go to change fighting or be a new concept go to be introduce can give any indication of that the president as say in opening statement the aggression have increase the force that be pursue that aggression have greatly increase in number will be necessary to resist that aggression and therefore to have substantially large increment of troop which have be supply from time to time do not think that anyone can tell at this date any special figure that will be require but think that follow ambassador lodge and secretary mcnamara 's trip will have a well estimate of what the rest of the|year will hold for q. mr. president some people have question the ability of the|south|vietnamese to govern at this point most recently senator stennis of mississippi can give some indication of what see in the future for the reestablishment of democratic civilian rule in saigon the president would hope that if the north|vietnamese would cease aggression could immediately take step to have the people of south|viet nam exercise choice and establish a government of choosing of course would hope that that would be a very efficient and effective and democratic system q. mr. president with the increase number of american troop go to viet nam would say if there will be a continue or any increase diplomatic probing for a peaceful settlement the president yes will constantly be on the alert to probe and to be ready and willing to negotiate with the appropriate people must say that candor compel to tell that there have not be the slight indication that the other side be interested in negotiation or in unconditional discussion although the|united|state have make some|dozen separate attempt to bring that about q. mr. president quite a bit have be write recently about relation with the press some of these story have be openly critical to say the least sir seem to have hear from everybody but wonder if could give view on the subject the president think that the press and the congress and the people of the|united|state have generally speak with very minor exception give during the time have be president very strong support and very excellent cooperation know that there be some in each segment that have be disappoint in some of decision and some of action like to think that those who talk about the most see the least and so far as be concern have no criticism to make of any other people in help do job have a very fine cabinet nearly every person have ask to come and help the government have do so think that there be very few president in the history of this country that have have more support of more publisher and more magazine than the present president be grateful for that although recognize be an essential part of duty to point up weakness that think exist have see that take place for some|35|year and as long as point out in the manner in which be point out and the people continue to support and the congress continue to support be not go to find any fault with during the period that have have the most hectic distress moment here in washington the poll have go up out in the country so sometimes think maybe just may be july in the|nation's|capital q. mr. president be take any position at this point on the poll tax repealer in the house version of the voting right bill the president yes have take a position since make recommendation to the congress early|in|the|year that would like to see the poll tax repeal be against the poll tax have try to get repeal every time that have have a chance when think could do legally have ask the attorney general to attempt to work with the conferee of both house and senate to see if can not agree on satisfactory language that will give the most effective repeal provision that be obtainable and that think can be support in the court have no doubt but what a very satisfactory solution will be find and think that would be quite desirable q. mr. president have discuss with leonard|marks as yet the particular man or the type of man that and may like to fill the other key vacancy in the usia the deputy director and the head of the|voice|of|america the president no the deputy director be now be handle by a very able man with experience who will be there for a while yet be sure that after mr. marks review the organization and talk to the present deputy director and the present director mr. rowan will come up with some suggestion and recommendation believe that will be acceptable q. mr. president in view of long history of seek to keep civil right a bipartisan matter why do single out the house republican leadership for criticism in statement on voting right last|week the president do not single out anyone have have several day ' debate about the relative merit of proposal have be observe that the administration proposal be dripping in venom and be inadequate and go too far and a good many thing have be say about finally when be put as a test to the judgment of the house and make decision commend that decision and say that believe that be wise in act as have because have adopt the so call ford or mcculloch substitute for the committee bill as advocate by judge howard|smith and governor tuck and other be of the opinion would have dilute and take strength from the bill that have pass be very proud of the action of the house be very proud of the judgment exercise in that connection but people be allow to comment on the relative merit of legislation either before or after a vote and find there have be a good many comment on proposal think would be appropriate if carefully limit to an observation that the substitute would have dilute the right of every american to vote think all of be aware of the fact that in year go by could have do much more than have in that field have become very conscious of that as have travel over this nation and talk to people think the house act wisely and have every confidence in the action that will follow the conference report ask the cooperation of member of both party do not think the substitute be as effective as the bill that be adopt and would not like to see return to q. mr. president in connection with civil right and the colloquy between and the republican leader have suggest that over the|year have change position on civil right wonder if could give concept of develop philosophy on civil right legislation the president yes think that all of realize at this stage of the|20th|century there be much that should have be do that have not be do this bill be not go to solve the problem completely there will be much to be do in the|years|ahead think the problem of the|american|negro be of the or most important problem that must face up to with legislation again next|year be particularly sensitive to the problem of the negro and the problem of the city and the problem which the shift in population have cause the problem of education have task force work on those thing and perhaps be because realize after travel through 44|states and after read or letter a week digest from that be a very acute problem and one that want to do good to solve in the .limite time that be allow do not have that responsibility in the|years|past and do not feel to the extent that do today hope that may understand that think be an acute one and a dangerous one and one that occupy high priority and one that should challenge every american of whatever party whatever religion be go to try to provide all the leadership that can notwithstanding the fact that someone may point to a mistake or mistake that make in past q. mr. president the|soviet|union announce yesterday a new aid agreement to north|viet nam think say be over and beyond what be now supply do see this as a serious perhaps dangerous contribution to the increase aggression speak of earlier that be be direct from the north the president peter do not think that can tell the extent of that agreement and how far will reach give no figure do not explain what material be go to supply have know for some time now that be furnish equipment and be furnish supply and be make contribution of aid in form or the other to north|viet nam this be no surprise to at all read the very general announcement that have make there be nothing that could detect from or that expert could detect that would give any more information than contain in the announcement q. mr. president do think possible that increase aggression and infiltration by north|viet nam spring from a misreading on the other side a perhaps mistaken belief that the teach in and whatever criticism there have be here in the|united|state of policy that this represent the voice of the american people the president no do not think that the teach in and the difference of opinion have increase the strength of the north|vietnamese or the aggression that have take place do think that at time ally particularly the south|vietnamese people and particularly own soldier do get concerned about how strong be behind and how united be in this very serious undertaking but be glad to say that do not think have have any serious or damaging effect there get several letter a day from soldier in viet nam service people the navy marines army and air hear from parent and have yet to receive a single complaining letter on occasion wish that the folk back home who be follow this with such dedicated interest understand the position as feel understand but do not think have damage effort out there and do not think will think will be unite in this effort there will be some difference of opinion about the wisdom of some course that the president take the executive take but whenever and wherever can will try to explain those to the people involve and at least try to get understanding q. mr. president there have be report publish from time to time that may contemplate a change in the office of the secretary of state in the|month to come do foresee such a change the president none whatever and think do a great damage and a great disservice to of the most able and most competent and most dedicated man that have ever know secretary rusk sit to right in the cabinet room rank first in the cabinet and rank first with q. mr. president there be recently publish version as to how president kennedy select as vice presidential running mate in mr. graham 's and mr. schlesinger 's which of these in judgment be close to the truth or do have own version the president would not want to get into a dispute with friend who have write these memorandum do not see anything to be gain by that the president ask on own motion to go on the ticket with and give reason for hesitating tell would speak to speaker rayburn and other and do subsequently call and say here be a statement be go to read on television unless have an objection listen to after hear feel that should do what do do not know just how much these man may know about what actually happen but be

dogma or prestige above the peace of all the world and just must find a way to do that be the most profound and the most urgent imperative of the time in which live so say to as personal belief and the belief think of the great american majority that the world must finish once and for all the myth of inequality of race and people with the scandal of discrimination with the shocking violation of human right and the cynical violation of political right must stop preach hatred must stop bring up entire new generation to preserve and to carry out the lethal fantasy of the old generation stop

reduction of those arm burden of the|united|state would hope that other will join with in come to next negotiation with proposal for effective attack upon these deadly danger to mankind and after peace high on the agenda of man be devotion to the dignity and to the worth of the human person and the promotion of well standard of life in large freedom for all of the human race in this country be

too numerous poor between education for the successful and education for all of the people be no longer a community or a nation or a continent but a whole generation of mankind for whom promise must be keep and keep within the|next|two|decade if those promise be not keep will be less and less possible to keep for any and that be why on this anniversary would call upon all member nation to

of man the heritage that share together be a fragile heritage a world war would certainly destroy pride and arrogance could destroy neglect and indifference could destroy could be destroy by narrow nationalism or ideological intolerance or rabid extremism of either the left or the right so must find the way as a community of nation as a|united|nation to keep the peace among and between all of

imperative of the time in which live so say to as personal belief and the belief think of the great american majority that the world must finish once and for all the myth of inequality of race and people with the scandal of discrimination with the shocking violation of human right and the cynical violation of political right must stop preach hatred must stop bring up entire new generation to

enemy may occasionally seize the|day of change but be the banner of revolution take and own future be link to this process of swift and turbulent change in many land in the world but nothing in any country touch more profoundly and nothing be more freighted with mean for own destiny than the revolution of the negro american in far too many way have be another nation deprive of freedom cripple by hatred the door of opportunity close to hope in time change have come to this nation too the|american|negro act with impressive restraint have peacefully protest and march enter the courtroom and the seat of government demand a justice that have long be deny the voice of the negro be the call to action but be a tribute to america that once arouse the court and the congress the president and most of the people have be the ally of progress thus have see the high court of the country declare that discrimination base on race be repugnant to the constitution and therefore void have see in and and again in the first civil right legislation in this nation in almost|an|entire|century as majority leader of the|united|states|senate help to guide of these bill through the senate and as president be proud to sign the third and now very soon will have the fourth â€” a new law guarantee every american the right to vote no act of entire administration will give great satisfaction than the|day when signature make this bill too the law of this land the voting right bill will be the late and among the most important in a long series of victory but this victory as winston|churchill say of another triumph for freedomâ€”"is not the end be not even the beginning of the end but be perhaps the end of the beginning that beginning be freedom and the barrier to that freedom be tumble down freedom be the right to share share fully and equally in american society to vote to hold a job to enter a public place to go to school be the right to be treat in every part of national life as a person equal in dignity and promise to all other but freedom be not enough do not wipe away the scar of century by say now be free to go where want and do as desire and choose the leader please do not take a person who for year have be hobble by chain and liberate bring up to the start line of a race and then say be free to compete with all the other and still justly believe that have be completely fair thus be not enough just to open the gate of opportunity all citizen must have the ability to walk through those gate this be the next and the more profound stage of the battle for civil right seek not just freedom but opportunity seek not just legal equity but human ability not just equality as a right and a theory but equality as a fact and equality as a result for the task be to give 20|million negroes the same chance as every other american to learn and grow to work and share in society to develop ability physical mental and spiritual and to pursue individual happiness to this end equal opportunity be essential but not enough not enough men and woman of all race be bear with the same range of ability but ability be not just the product of birth ability be stretch or stunt by the family that live with and the neighborhood live in by the school go to and the poverty or the richness of surrounding be the product of a unseen force play upon the little infant the child and finally the man this graduate class at howard|university be witness to the indomitable determination of the negro american to win way in american life the number of negroes in school of high learning have almost double in the number of nonwhite professional worker have more than double in the median income of negro college woman tonight exceed that of white college woman and there be also the enormous accomplishment of distinguished individual negroes many of graduate of this institution and of the first lady ambassador in the history of the|united|state these be proud and impressive achievement but tell only the story of a grow middle class minority steadily narrow the gap between and white counterpart but for the great majority of negro|americans â€” the poor the unemployed the uprooted and the dispossessed there be a much grimmer story still as meet here tonight be another nation despite the court order and the law despite the legislative victory and the speech for the wall be rise and the gulf be widen here be some of the fact of this american failure five|years|ago the rate of unemployment for negroes and white be about the same tonight the negro rate be twice as high in the unemployment rate for negro teenage boy be actually less than that of white by last|year that rate have grow to as against for white unemployed between|1949|and|1959 the income of negro man relative to white man decline in every section of this country from the median income of negro family compare to white actually drop from to in the|years|1955|through|1957 of experienced negro worker be out of work at some time during the|year in through that proportion have soar to since the number of white family live in poverty have decrease while the number of poor nonwhite family decrease only|3|percent the infant mortality of nonwhite in be great than white two|years|later be great moreover the isolation of negro from white community be increase rather than decrease as negroes crowd into the central city and become a city within a city of course negro|americans as well as white americans have share in rise national abundance but the harsh fact of the matter be that in the battle for true equality too many far too many be lose ground every day be not completely sure why this be know the cause be complex and subtle but do know the broad basic reason and do know that have to act first negroes be trap as many white be trap in inherit gate less poverty lack training and skill be shut in in slum without decent medical care private and public poverty combine to cripple capacity be try to attack these evil through poverty program through education program through medical care and other health program and more of the great|society program that be aim at the root cause of this poverty will increase and will accelerate and will broaden this attack in year to come until this most enduring of foe finally yield to unyielding will but there be a second cause much more difficult to explain more deeply ground more desperate in force be the devastating heritage of long year of slavery and a century of oppression hatred and injustice for negro poverty be not white poverty many of cause and many of cure be the same but there be difference deep corrosive obstinate difference radiate painful root into the community and into the family and the nature of the individual these difference be not racial difference be solely and simply the consequence of ancient brutality past injustice and present prejudice be anguish to observe for the negro be a constant reminder of oppression for the white be a constant reminder of guilt but must be face and must be deal with and must be overcome if be ever to reach the time when the only difference between negroes and white be the color of skin nor can find a complete answer in the experience of other american minority make a valiant and a largely successful effort to emerge from poverty and prejudice the negro like these other will have to rely mostly upon own effort but just can not do alone for do not have the heritage of century to overcome and do not have a cultural tradition which have be twist and batter by endless year of hatred and hopelessness nor be exclude these other because of race or color a feeling whose dark intensity be match by no other prejudice in society nor can these difference be understand as isolated infirmity be a seamless web cause each other result from each other reinforce each other much of the negro community be bury under a blanket of history and circumstance be not a lasting solution to lift just corner of that blanket must stand on all side and must raise the entire cover if be to liberate fellow citizen of the difference be the increase concentration of negroes in city more|than|73|percent of all negroes live in urban area compare with of the white most of these negroes live in slum most of these negroes live together a separate people man be shape by world when be a world of decay ring by an invisible wall when escape be arduous and uncertain and the save pressure of a more hopeful society be unknown can cripple the youth and can desolate the man there be also the burden that a dark skin can add to the search for a productive place in society unemployment strike most swiftly and broadly at the negro and this burden erode hope blight hope breed despair despair bring indifference to the learning which offer a way out and despair couple with indifference be often the source of destructive rebellion against the fabric of society there be also the lacerate hurt of early collision with white hatred or prejudice distaste or condescension other group have feel similar intolerance but success and achievement could wipe away do not change the color of a man 's skin have see this uncomprehending pain in the eye of the little young mexican american schoolchildren that teach but can be overcome but for many the wound be always open perhaps most important influence radiate to every part of life be the breakdown of the negro family structure for this most of all white america must accept responsibility flow from century of oppression and persecution of the negro man flow from the|long|years of degradation and discrimination which have attack dignity and assault ability to produce for family this too be not pleasant to look upon but must be face by those whose serious intent be to improve the life of all americans only a minority less than half of all negro child reach the age of have live all life with both of parent at this moment tonight little less than third be at home with both of parent probably a majority of all negro child receive federally aid public assistance sometime during childhood the family be the cornerstone of society more than any other force shape the attitude the hope the ambition and the value of the child and when the family collapse be the child that be usually damage when happen on a massive scale the community be crippled so unless work to strengthen the family to create condition under which most parent will stay together all the rest school and playground and public assistance and private concern will never be enough to cut completely the circle of despair and deprivation there be no single easy answer to all of these problem job be part of the answer bring the income which permit a man to provide for family decent home in decent surrounding and a chance to learn â€” an equal chance to learn â€” be part of the answer welfare and social program better design to hold family together be part of the answer care for the sick be part of the answer an understand heart by all americans be another big part of the answer and to all of these front and more will dedicate the expand effort of the johnson administration but there be other answer that be still to be find nor do fully understand even all of the problem therefore want to announce tonight that this fall intend to call a white|house conference of scholar and expert and outstanding negro leader man of both race and official of government at every level this white|house conference 's theme and title will be to fulfill these rights object will be to help the|american|negro fulfill the right which after the long time of injustice be finally about to secure to move beyond opportunity to achievement to shatter forever not only the barrier of law and public practice but the wall which bind the condition of many by the color of skin to dissolve as good can the antique enmity of the heart which diminish the holder divide the great democracy and do wrong great wrong to the child of god and pledge tonight that this will be a chief goal of administration and of program next|year and in the|year to come and hope and pray and believe will be a part of the program of all america for what be justice be to fulfill the fair expectation of man thus american justice be a very special thing for from the first this have be a land of tower expectation be to be a nation where each man could be rule by the common consent of all â€” enshrine in law give life by institution guide by man subject to rule and all â€” all of every station and origin would be touch equally in obligation and in liberty beyond the law lie the land be a rich land glow with more abundant promise than man have ever see here unlike any place yet know all be to share the harvest and beyond this be the dignity of man each could become whatever quality of mind and spirit would permit to strive to seek and if could to find happiness this be american justice have pursue faithfully to the edge of imperfection and have fail to find for the|american|negro so be the glorious opportunity of this generation to end the huge wrong of the|american|nation and in so do to find america for with the same immense thrill of discovery which grip those who first begin to realize that here at last be a home for freedom all will take be for all of to understand what this country be and what this country must become the scripture promise shall light a candle of understanding in thine heart which shall not be put out together and with million more can light that candle of understanding in the heart of all america and once light will never again go out view transcript transcript the president good afternoon lady and

contribution hope in the|next|few|day on the political side be now consider the|organization|of|american|state ' certain solution for the|dominican|republic which could very well serve as an indication of what may come in similar situation down the road have have very enlighten and very positive leadership under mr. mora the secretary general of the oas in the|dominican|republic and hope not only can supply force to help provide the military answer to the necessity in that field but that can evolve a formula that will provide judicious determination in connection with political judgment that need to make in the near future u.s. efforts in the dominican republic q. mr. president could spell out for sir the effort and role that the|united|states have be play in seek a compromise government in the|dominican|republic and what think the chance for success be the president yes will be very glad to find necessary in order to preserve own citizen ' life and in order to stop the wholesale killing of hundred and even thousand of dominicans to intervene in the|dominican|republic since that time have counsel at great length and seek the assistance of the oas in connection with contribute the military force that would bring about a cease fire and preserve the peace at the same time have urge the oas to establish machinery to help find a political solution and await the establishment of that machinery which be really consider in the oas today have send some of the good people in this government to maintain contact with the broad base of leadership in the|dominican|republic in the hope that there would in due time evolve a broadly base government that would meet with the approval of the dominican people have have mr. vance mr. bundy mr. mann mr. vaughn,6 and other maintain liaison with various leader of various group there those conference have be take place from day to day and have be keep the oas and representative fully inform be hopeful that in due time will reach conclusion as to how think can be best handle and that will be able to contribute part and cooperate with as know be discuss the matter over the|weekend and today and hope that a decision will be in the offing in the immediate future have no desire to insist upon particular brand of military solution or political solution think be an inter - american matter and want to cooperate fully with prior to intervention consult and discuss the gravity of the situation there with latin|american nation begin on saturday when the revolution take place up through wednesday when send the marines in during that same period meet with the|peace|committee|of|the|oas on tuesday and meet with the|oas|council on wednesday have be desire all along to contribute all could to a cease fire to the eventual evolution of a stable government that would be broadly base and to make appropriate contribution to the necessary reconstruction of that country feel that when the oas reach decision that that decision will be communicate to the people of the|dominican|republic hope that will be able to find agreement between the inter - american body and the folk there that will ultimately lead to an expression of opinion by the people of the|dominican|republic and ultimately lead to a broadly base government that will include none of the extreme q. mr. president do feel mayor wagner should run again the president think that be a matter not for the president to determine q. mr. president do think that the attack which have be make on oas secretary general mora in the|dominican|republic may have undermine usefulness as a peace negotiator the president no do not think so think may have have that objective in mind that may have be purpose but know the old story when a man get in the role of a mediator both side usually hit at but think as say in opening statement that the secretary general have perform a very useful role a very intelligent and a very objective one and have every confidence in effort have regret to see the attack come upon as have regret to see the attack come upon but much prefer the attack to what could have happen except for action and except for action q. mr. president this|morning sir say welcome and ask for new idea in foreign policy from university and journal and public platform across the land question sir do this mean approve of the university teach in technique and what be view of dissent comment on viet nam and other foreign problem the president will answer the latter question first think that this administration profit from the suggestion and recommendation of leader in other branch of government from man who occupy public platform from general discussion think that be the strength of the american system instead of a weakness be hopeful that every person will always exercise the free speech that the constitution guarantee and would prefer of course that be constructive and be responsible and think generally that have be true be glad that live in a nation where in the midst of conflict when man be die to preserve freedom that citizen still do not fear to exercise and can assure that do exercise q. mr. president there have be a flare up of the fighting in viet nam could give an estimate of the situation there the military situation the president have anticipate that would have some action of this type at this|season|of|the|year have have a rather serious engagement in the|last|few|hour in the most immediate past the south|vietnamese have lose accord to the report have dozen even hundred of people do not know exactly the extent of the viet cong loss although believe to be substantial do not announce those perhaps unfortunately along with the announcement of own loss know how many lose but do not know how many lose until get out there and count so loss never really catch up with the original story of loss suffice to say think have be serious be concerned about be occupy attention as know general taylor plan to be here in the|next|few|day and will probably have more definite information at that time just about the detail of this particular engagement q. mr. president sir last|month when speak to the nation on the dominican republic indicate that the threat of communist control of the rebel movement be very serious more recently have include the rebel leader in these talk for coalition do feel that the communist threat in the|dominican|republic be now over the president oh no if want to elaborate on that a little bit will say that the threat be great before americans arrive there always be the communists do not in judgment originate this revolution but join and south|viet nam participate in be active in and in a good many place be in charge of think that follow the action that this nation take serve a very good purpose and some of the man who have originally participate in the revolution and have to take asylum return and more moderate force take leadership the communist element have not be so active although presence be still note hour|by|hour effectiveness be still observe from day to day see handiwork in the|dominican|republic and elsewhere throughout the world particularly in the propaganda field q. mr. president do foresee that an inter - american peace force which may be set up permanently would be use only to suppress communist direct revolutionary movement in latin|america or would also be use to thwart revolution by military junta which be attempt to destroy elect government would also like to ask in view of the precedent which may be create by such a force would look with favor upon the creation of similar regional force in such area as africa and the arab world the president would not want to anticipate what action the oas be go to take q. mr. president today the|supreme|court hand down several decision in reapportionment case in line with doctrine of man vote however as know there be several proposal already introduce in congress for constitutional amendment which would nullify this doctrine in part could tell what administration 's position be on this legislation the president the president do not take action in connection with constitutional amendment have review some of the proposal that have be make be generally sympathetic with the reapportionment take place throughout the country in compliance with the|supreme|court 's decision would not want to get into detailed discussion of the individual program about which the president will not act way or the other because a constitutional amendment do not require white|house action be a matter for the representative of the people to decide in submit the congress take that action the people have an opportunity to judge when the congress do get down to debate the question and consider will of course spend some time on and become thoroughly conversant with but would not want to predict at this time just what measure would emerge in the form of an amendment or what action congress or the people may take on q. mr. president the astronaut flight on thursday be go to have more maneuvering than be originally announce be this increase do at suggestion or urging sir the president no q. mr. president if the situation in viet nam in which have promise the|united|state to help that country achieve victory become such that american combat troop be use in the combat there would give that order sir in the event that there be an invasion from the north the president do not see that can do any good the country any good or any good by discuss future operational plan know of no real reason why ought to photograph or decide until be confront with that possibility q. mr. president in connection with statement on

that request through the press office this opportunity for to meet together because after look at some of the cartoon have draw think would invite over to see in person after all have nothing to lose know that be talk to the most influential journalist in america reporter may write and politician may talk but what draw remain in the public memory long after these other word be forget that be why after learn that would be here and would meet together put together some note to discuss with while be in washington a very little know side of activity in of the most vital place in the world south|viet nam the war in viet nam have many face there be the face of armed conflict of terror and gunfire of bomb heavy plane and campaign weary soldier in this conflict only object be to prove that force will meet force & nbsp;that armed conquest be futile and that aggression be not only wrong but just will not work and the communists in viet nam be slowly begin to realize what once scorn to believe that combine unlimited patience with unlimited resource in pursuit of an unwavering purpose will not abandon commitment to south|viet nam the second face of war in viet nam be the quest for a political solution the face of diplomacy and politic of the ambition and the interest of other nation know as adversary should also know that there be no purely military solution in sight for either side be ready for unconditional discussion most of the non - communist nation of the world favor such unconditional discussion and would dearly be in the interest of north|viet nam to now come to the conference table for the continuation of war without talk mean only damage without conquest communist china apparently desire the war to continue whatever the cost to ally target be not merely south|viet nam be asia objective be not the fulfillment of vietnamese nationalism be to erode and to discredit america 's ability to help prevent chinese domination over all of asia in this domination shall never succeed and be continue and be increase the search for every possible path to peace the third face of war in viet nam be at once the most tragic and most hopeful be the face of human need be the untended sick the hungry family and the illiterate child be man and woman many without shelter with rag for clothing struggle for survival in a very rich and a very fertile land be the most important battle of all in which be engage for a nation can not be build by armed power or by political agreement will rest on the expectation by individual man and woman that future will be well than past be not enough to just fight against something people must fight for something and the people of south|viet nam must know that after the long brutal journey through the dark tunnel of conflict there break the light of a happy day and only if this be so can be expect to sustain the endure will for continued strife only in this way can long run stability and peace come to land and there be another more profound reason in viet nam communism seek to really impose will by force of arm but would be deeply mistaken to think that this be the only weapon here as other place in the world speak to restless people people rise to shatter the old way which have imprison hope people fiercely and justly reach for the material fruit from the tree of modern knowledge be this desire and not simply lust for conquest which move many of the individual fighting man that must now sadly call the enemy be therefore task to show that freedom from the control of other nation offer the sure road to progress that history and experience testify to this truth but be not enough to call upon reason or point to example must show through action and must show through accomplishment and even be there no war either hot or cold would always be active in humanity 's search for progress this task be command to by the moral value of civilization and rest on the inescapable nature of the world that have now enter for in that world as long as can foresee every threat to man 's welfare will be a threat to the welfare of own people those who live in the emerge community of nation will ignore the peril of neighbor at the risk of own prospect this be true not only for viet nam but for every part of the develop world this be why on behalf recently propose a massive cooperative development effort for all of southeast asia name the respected leader eugene|black as personal representative to inaugurate participation in these program since that time rapid progress have be make be glad to report mr. black have meet with the top official of the|united|nation on several occasion have talk to other interested party have find increase enthusiasm the|united|nation be already set up new mechanism to help carry forward the work of development in addition the|united|state be now prepared to participate in and to support an asian|development|bank to carry out and help finance the economic progress in that area of the world and the development that desire to see in that area of the world so this|morning call on every other industrialize nation include the|soviet|union to help create a well life for all of the people of southeast asia surely surely the work of peace can bring man together in a common effort to abandon forever the work of war but as south|viet nam be the central place of conflict be also a principal focus of work to increase the well being of people be in that effort in south|viet nam which think be too little informed and which want to relate to this|morning begin in when viet nam become independent before the war between the north and the south since that time have spend more|than|$2|billion in economic help for the people of south|viet nam and despite the ravage of war have make steady continue gain have concentrate on food and health and education and housing and industry like most develop country south|viet nam 's economy rest on agriculture unlike many

if the vietnamese have doctor in the same ratio as the|united|state have doctor would have not the that do have but would have doctor have help vaccinate already over|7|million people against cholera and million more against other disease hundreds|of|thousand of vietnamese can now receive treatment in the hamlet health station that america have build and have stock new clinic and surgical suite be scatter throughout that entire country and the medical school that be now help to build will graduate as many doctor in a|single|year as now serve the entire population of south|viet nam education be the keystone of future development in viet nam take a train people to man the factory to conduct the administration to form the human foundation for an advance nation more|than|a|quarter|million young vietnamese can now learn in more|than|4,000 classroom that america have help to build in the|last|2|years and more school be go to be build by in the|next|12|month the number of student in vocational

north the south be barren of manufacturing and the foundation for industry but today new or rehabilitate factory textile mill and cement plant electronic and plastic be change the entire face of that nation new road and communication railroad equipment and electric generator be a spread base on which this new industry can and be grow all this progress go on and be go to continue to go on under

in the word of the communists to cut the finger off the hand of the government intend to continue and intend to increase help to viet nam nor can anyone doubt the determination of the south|vietnamese have lose of man since become president a|little|over|a|year|ago but progress do not come from investment alone or plan on a desk or even the directive and the order that approve here in washington take man man must take the seed to the farmer man must teach the use of fertilizer man must help in harvest man must build the school and man must instruct the student man must carry medicine into the jungle and treat the sick and shelter the homeless and man brave tireless fill with love for fellow be do this today be do through the long hot danger fill vietnamese day and the sultry night the full glory must go also to those south|vietnamese that be labor and die for own people and own nation in hospital and school along the rice field and the road continue to labor never know when death or terror may strike how incredible be that there be a few who still say that the south|vietnamese do not want to continue this struggle be sacrifice and be die by the thousand patient valor in the heavy presence of personal physical danger should be a helpful lesson to those of who here in america only have to read about or hear about on the television or radio have own hero who labor at the work of peace in the midst of war toil unarmed and out of uniform know the humanity of concern do not exempt from the horror of conflict yet go on from day to day bring food to the hungry over there supply the sick with necessary medicine help the farmer with crop family to find clean water village to receive the healing miracle of electricity these be americans who have join aid program and welcome other to rank for most americans this be an easy war man fight and man suffer and man die as always must in war but the life of most of at least those of in this room and those listen to this|morning be untrouble prosperity rise abundance increase the nation flourish will report to the cabinet when leave this room that be in the|51st|month of continued prosperity the long peacetime prosperity for america since country be found yet entire future be at stake what a difference would make if could only call upon a small fraction of unmatched private resource business and union agricultural group and builder if could call to the task of peaceful progress in viet nam with such a spirit of patriotic sacrifice may well strike an irresistible blow for freedom there and for freedom throughout the

make friend or lose friend q. mr. president voting right bill be move toward completion in the senate this|week do think that proposal the amendment to abolish the poll tax would make this unconstitutional do think would damage the passage of the bill in the house and what do think about generally the president think that be be work out in the conference be have today and will have in the|next|few|week have always oppose the poll tax be oppose to now have be advise by constitutional lawyer that have a problem in repeal the poll tax by statute for that reason while a member of congress initiate and support a constitutional amendment to repeal the poll tax in federal election think the bill as now draw will not permit the poll tax to be use to discriminate against voter and think the administration will have adequate authority to prevent use for that purpose have ask the attorney general however to meet with the various member of the house and senate who be interested in this phase of and if possible take every step that can within constitutional bound to see that the poll tax be not use as a discrimination against any voter anywhere q. mr. president a number of critic of viet nam policy say support presence in south|viet nam but do not support the bombing raid to the north wonder if there be anything can say to and what can say on any condition that may

the primary target that have attack there be no blood in a bridge make of concrete and steel but do try to take out so that people can not furnish additional troop and additional equipment to kill the people of south|viet nam and to kill own soldier there be not many civilian involve in a radar station but do try to make ineffective so that can not plot plane and shoot boy out of the sky there be not many individual involve in an ammunition dump but have try to destroy that ammunition so that would be explode in north|viet nam and not in the body of the people of south|viet nam or american soldier have say time and time again that regret the necessity of do this but as long as aggression continue as long as bomb in south|viet nam as long as bomb sport arena and theater and embassy and kill woman and child and the vietnamese soldier of whom have be kill since think that be justified in try to slow down that operation and make realize that be very costly and that aggression should cease do sometimes wonder how some people can be so concerned with bombing a cold bridge of steel and concrete in north|viet nam but never open mouth about a bomb be place in embassy in south|viet nam the moment that this aggression cease the destruction of bridge and radar station and the ammunition that use on body will cease q. mr. president on cancellation of the ayub and shastri visit some of

which vitally affect that part of the world and that could be much more communicative and could respond much more to suggestion and to recommendation on the future of india and plan and pakistan and plan if visit could follow the enactment of some of these bill instead of precede because if precede could not speak with authority would not know what the congress would do have spend in excess of in that area and this|year will propose expenditure of more|than|$1|billion but if the congress say no to and do not pass the foreign aid bill or materially reduce would have make a commitment that could not support so say if would like to come now in the|month|of|may|or|june during this period can have a visit but will not be able to be as responsive as would like to be if could come a little later in the year have be host a few time in life and when put thing that way most people want to come at the time that would be most convenient to to the host and would be most helpful to communicate that to the appropriate people and the answer come back that would accept that decision think be a good decision in interest and think be a good decision in interest be very sorry that people have make a good deal of but the provocation of the difference sometimes come about and regret so far as know be a good decision and a wise and one that would make again tomorrow q. mr. president in light of the

assist the people of south|viet nam who have lose thousand of life defend country and to provide the maximum amount of deterrent with the minimum cost have lose thousand of people since february have

shape own destiny and only in such a world will own freedom be finally secure this kind of world will never be build by bomb or bullet yet the infirmity of man be such that force must often precede reason and the waste of war the work of peace wish that this be not so but must deal with the world as be if be ever to be as wish the world as be in asia be not a serene or peaceful place the first reality be that north|viet nam have attack the independent nation of south|viet nam object be total conquest of course some of the people of south|viet nam be participate in attack on own government but train man and supply order and arm flow in a constant stream from north to south this support be the heartbeat of the war and be a war of unparalleled brutality simple farmer be the target of assassination and kidnapping woman and child be strangle in the night because man be loyal to government and help less village be ravage by sneak attack large scale raid be conduct on town and terror strike in the heart of city the confused nature of this conflict can not mask the fact that be the new face of an old enemy over this war and all asia be another reality the deepen shadow of communist china the ruler in hanoi be urge on by peking this be a regime which have destroy freedom in tibet which have attack india and have be condemn by the|united|nation for aggression in korea be a nation which be help the force of violence in almost every continent the contest in viet nam be part of a wide pattern of aggressive purpose why be these reality concern why be in south|viet nam be there because have a promise to keep since every american president have offer support to the people of south|viet nam have help to build and have help to defend thus over many year have make a national pledge to he!p south|viet nam defend independence and intend to keep that promise to dishonor that pledge to abandon this small and brave nation to enemy and to the terror that must follow would be an unforgivable wrong be also there to strengthen world order around the globe from berlin to thailand be people whose well be rest in part on the belief that can count on if be attack to leave viet nam to fate would shake the confidence of all these people in the value of an american commitment and in the value of america 's word the result would be increase unrest and instability and even wide war be also there because there be great stake in the balance let no one think for a moment that retreat from viet nam would bring an end to conflict the battle would be renew in country and then another the central lesson of time be that the appetite of aggression be never satisfied to withdraw from battlefield mean only to prepare for the next must say in southeast asia as do in europe in the word of the bible hitherto shalt thou come but no further there be those who say that all effort there will be futile that china 's power be such that be bind to dominate all southeast asia but there be no end to that argument until all of the nation of asia be swallow up there be those who wonder why have a responsibility there well have there for the same reason that have a responsibility for the defense of europe world|war|ii be fight in both europe and asia and when end find with continued responsibility for the defense of freedom objective be the independence of south|viet nam and freedom from attack want nothing for only that the people of south|viet nam be allow to guide own country in own way will do everything necessary to reach that objective and will do only what be absolutely necessary in recent|months attack on south|viet nam be step up thus become necessary for to increase response and to make attack by air this be not a change of purpose be a change in what believe that purpose require do this in order to slow down aggression do this to increase the confidence of the brave people of south|viet nam who have bravely bear this brutal battle for so|many|year with so many casualty and do this to convince the leader of north|viet nam and all who seek to share conquest of a very simple fact will not be defeat will not grow tired will not withdraw either openly or under the cloak of a meaningless agreement know that air attack alone will not accomplish all of these purpose but be good and prayerful judgment that be a necessary part of the sure road to peace hope that peace will come swiftly but that be in the hand of other besides and must be prepare for a long continued conflict will require patience as well as bravery the will to endure as well as the will to resist wish be possible to convince other with word of what now find necessary to say with gun and plane armed hostility be futile resource be equal to any challenge because fight for value and fight for principle rather than territory or colony patience and determination be unending once this be clear then should also be clear that the only path for reasonable man be the path of peaceful settlement such peace demand an independent south|viet nam securely guarantee and able to shape own relationship to all other free from outside interference tie to no alliance a military base for no other country these be the essential of any final settlement will never be second in the search for such a peaceful settlement in viet nam there may be many way to this kind of peace in discussion or negotiation with the government concern in large group or in small one in the reaffirmation of old agreement or strengthening with new one have state this position over and over again time and more to friend and foe alike and remain ready with this purpose for unconditional discussion and until that bright and necessary day of peace will try to keep conflict from spread have no desire to see thousand die in battle asians or americans have no desire to devastate that which the people of north|viet nam have build with toil and sacrifice will use power with restraint and with all the wisdom that can command but will use this war like most war be fill with terrible irony for what do the people of north|viet nam want want what neighbor also desire food for hunger health for body a chance to learn progress for country and an end to the bondage of material misery and would find all these thing far more readily in peaceful association with other than in the endless course of battle these country of southeast asia be home for million of impoverished people each|day these people rise at dawn and struggle through until the|night to wrestle existence from the soil be often wrack by disease plague by hunger and death come at the|early|age|of|40 stability and peace do not come easily in such a land neither independence nor human dignity will ever be win though by arm alone also require the work of peace the american people have help generously in time past in these work now there must be a much more massive effort to improve the life of man in that conflict tear corner of world the first step be for the country of southeast asia to associate in a greatly expand cooperative effort for development would hope that north|viet nam would take place in the common effort just as soon as peaceful cooperation be possible the|united|nation be already actively engage in development in this area as far back as confer with authority in viet nam in connection with work there and would hope tonight that the secretary general of the|united|nation could use the prestige of great office and deep knowledge of asia to initiate as soon as possible with the country of that area a plan for cooperation in increase development for part will ask the congress to join in a billion|dollar american investment in this effort as soon as be underway and would hope that all other industrialized country include the|soviet|union will join in this effort to replace despair with hope and terror with progress the task be nothing less than to enrich the hope and the existence of people and there be much to be do the vast mekong|river can provide food and water and power on a scale to dwarf even own tva the wonder of modern medicine can be spread through village where thousand die every|year from lack of care school can be establish to train people in the skill that be need to manage the process of development and these objective and more be within the reach of a cooperative and determined effort also intend to expand and speed up a program to make available farm surplus to assist in feeding and clothe the needy in asia should not allow people to go hungry and wear rag while own warehouse overflow with an abundance of wheat and corn rice and cotton so will very shortly name a special team of outstanding patriotic distinguish americans to inaugurate participation in these program this team will be head by mr. eugene|black the very able former president of the|world|bank in area that be still rip by conflict of course development will not be easy peace will be necessary for final success but can not and must not wait for peace to begin this job this will be a disorderly planet for a long time in asia as elsewhere the force of the modern world be shake old way and uproot ancient civilization there will be turbulence and struggle and even violence great social change as see in own country now do not always come without conflict must also expect that nation will on occasion be in dispute with may be because be rich or powerful or because have make some mistake or because honestly fear intention however no nation nee ever fear that desire land or to impose will or to dictate institution but will always oppose the effort of nation to conquer another nation will do this because own security be at stake but there be more to than that for generation have a dream be a very old dream but have the power and now have the opportunity to make that dream come true for century nation have struggle among each other but dream of a world where dispute be settle by law and reason and will try to make so for most of history man have hate and kill another in battle but dream of an end to war and will try to make so for all existence most man have live in poverty threaten by hunger but dream of a world where all be feed and charge with hope and will help to make so the ordinary man and woman of north|viet nam and south|viet nam of china and india of russia and america be brave people be fill with the same proportion of hate and fear of love and hope most of want the same thing for and family most of do not want son to ever die in battle or to see home or the home of other destroy well this can be world yet man now have the knowledge always before deny to make this planet serve the real need of the people who live on know this will not be easy know how difficult be for reason to guide passion and love to master hate the complexity of this world do not bow easily to pure and consistent answer but the simple truth be there just the same must all try to follow as best can often say how impressive power be but do not find impressive at all the gun and the bomb the rocket and the warship be all symbol of human failure be necessary symbol protect what cherish but be witness to human folly a dam build across a great river be impressive in the countryside where be bear and where live have see the night

the impression that do not quite believe that governor wallace maneuver into this position only for monetary consideration wonder if could tell why think the governor have do what have do the president do not want to leave such an impression want to correct if have leave the wrong impression what motivate governor wallace be a matter that can discuss with well than can have responsibility and be go to exercise accord to judgment and view and plan to do the same thing just repeat the statement make in wire q. mr. president do have any idea of the number of people who will take part in the march and be there any federal service available to for medical care or that sort of thing the president be keep in very close touch with the leader of the march have reasonably accurate estimate of how many think will be include have medical force in the general area have be alert to take care of any need that may arise and hope and pray that there will be none have a hospital with doctor and ambulance aircraft helicopter patient litter with corpsman this be locate at craig in selma at maxwell|field have a hospital doctor ambulance h-43 aircraft trust will not be necessary to use any of these but have take the precaution and there be hardly a day pass but what the president be ask to provide medical service to some citizen where be not available from other source and do that in all instance where be justified q. mr. president in telegram to governor wallace have refer to discussion with have have discussion with since this crisis develop or do that refer to early talk the president have be constantly in touch with general katzenbach and other member of the executive branch in washington and here since receive wire the other evening have not talk to have not talk to any of people but people be talk to with regularity and try to give such counsel and guidance as think will be helpful q. mr. president sir west|german arm supply to israel which be institute with u.s. support have be cut off in view of this would be willing to supply arm to israel to maintain a balance of power in the president do not discuss iffy question like that will give consideration to the problem and the need of the various nation and country and while have under consideration will try to evaluate and if a decision be reach in any area with any country why will carry out but do not think that be desirable to speculate or to engage in any prophecy that may or may not work out q. mr. president under the term of the|voting|rights|act do the administration plan to lower the literacy requirement if federal examiner be use and possibly so far that illiterate could be register in the south the president the administration have make proposal in the form of legislation pende before the house committee there will be a number of amendment add to that and a number of change and own personal view be include in the recommendation in that bill which be available to should have like to have go further if think could have without a constitutional amendment if could have do by statute in other respect concern voting but the legal talent available do not think that could make these addition the final judgment of just how far do go in connection with literacy and qualification of the elector will be determine by the judiciary committee make up of lawyer and the other members of the congress very frankly would like to have include in the message a provision that would permit all people over to vote but the lawyer feel that would complicate the matter and that should be approach otherwise but specifically answer question what final action will be take in the bill that be send to will be determine by what be go on now and hope that will work every|morning|and|afternoon|and|night and that can have legislation very shortly q. mr. president in the|6|weeks sir that have be bomb north of the 17th parallel have there be any measurable change in the north|vietnamese support of the viet|cong guerrilla in south|viet nam the president would not want to tell or or the country any of evaluation of military operation at this time be be as effective and as efficient as know how have policy of respond appropriately fittingly and measure be do everything that know to try to bring about freedom for south|viet nam and peace in that area that be the policy that general|eisenhower announce when be president when assume responsibility there that be the policy provide for in the|seato|treaty that pass the senate which obligate to the commitment have make there that be the policy that be incorporate in the resolution pass august|the|10th by the congress but to give a day to day evaluation of what effect this strike or that strike may have would not only contribute think to confusion and perhaps may be inaccurate but would be ill advise think q. mr. president where do space program stand in relation to the soviets in the wake of late feat the president well send a wire congratulate and express good wish for the successful outcome of of test administrator|webb be here today come in last|night from new|mexico where have be on an official visit ask to be here this|morn and have review the russian activity in space this|week as well as own planned activity next|week the soviet accomplishment and own scheduled effort demonstrate think dramatically and convincingly the important role that man will play in the exploration of the space frontier the continue effort of both program and the russian program will steadily produce new capability and new space activity these capability in judgment will help each nation achieve broad confidence to do what consider ought to do in space have feel since the|day when introduce the space act and sit study sputnik i and sputnik|ii that be really a mistake to regard space exploration as a contest which can be tally on any box score judgment can be make only by consider all the objective of the national program and will vary and will differ own program be very broadly base believe very confidently in the|united|state that will produce contribution that need at the time need for that reason give mr. webb and group every dollar in the budget this|year that ask for for a man space flight now the progress of program be very satisfactory to in every respect be commit to peaceful purpose for the benefit of all mankind stress that in hearing and legislation when pass the bill and while the soviet be ahead of in some aspect of space u.s. leadership be clear and decisive and be ahead of in other realm on which have particularly concentrate if be not an imposition on and if care to have not consult but after the conference be over if be not in too big a hurry to get back to the driskill mr. webb will be here and will answer any question may want to ask q. mr. president to return to the alabama situation there have be an incursion of proponent of the civil right measure into the selma area have also be report there have be opponent of the civil right group do know anything about the number of say extremist oppose this and what can do about and how dangerous will this march be that begin tomorrow the president think have state the fact that be available to all of the people on the ground be take judicious notice of the entire situation hope that have take the necessary precaution and be adequately prepared to deal with whatever may develop but think would be a great mistake to predict disaster and think that have the people that have the training and that will carry out the normal police function and hope have the patriotism on every side of the question and on all viewpoint to obey law and order and to respond to plea this|morning that conduct as law abide americans who want to unite country instead of divide q. mr. president do feel that the debate in the congress concern viet nam and especially those who have be urge quick negotiation have

secret heart of america rarely be meet with a challenge not to growth or abundance welfare or security but rather to the value and the purpose and the meaning of beloved nation the issue of equal right for be such an issue and should defeat every enemy should double wealth and conquer the star and still be unequal to this issue then will have fail as a people and as a nation for with a country

problem and be meet here tonight as americans â€” not as democrats or republicans be meet here as americans to solve that problem this be the first nation in the history of the world to be found with a purpose the great phrase of that purpose still sound in every american heart north|and|south all man be create equal"â€”"government by consent of the governed"â€”"give liberty or give death well those be not just clever word or those be not just empty theory in name americans have fight and die for two|centurie and tonight around the world stand there as guardian of liberty risk life those word be a promise to every citizen that shall share in the dignity of man this dignity can not be find in a man 's possession can not be find in power or in position really rest on right to be treat as a man equal in opportunity to all other say that shall share in freedom shall choose leader educate child and provide for family accord to ability and merit as a human being to apply any other test to deny a man hope because of color or race religion or the place of birth be not only to do injustice be to deny america and to dishonor the dead who give life for american freedom father believe that if this noble view of the right of man be to flourish must be root in democracy the most basic right of all be the right to choose own leader the history of this country in large measure be the history of the expansion of that right to all of people many of the issue of civil right be very complex and most difficult but about this there can and should be no argument every american citizen must have an equal right to vote there be no reason which can excuse the denial of that right there be no duty which weigh more heavily on than the duty have to ensure that right yet the harsh fact be that in many place in this country man and woman be keep from vote simply because be negroes every device of which human ingenuity be capable have be use to deny this right the negro citizen may go to register only to be tell that the|day be wrong or the|hour be late or the official in charge be absent and if persist and if manage to present to the registrar may be disqualify because do not spell out middle name or because abbreviate a word on the application and if manage to fill out an application be give a test the registrar be the sole judge of whether pass this test may be ask to recite the entire constitution or explain the most complex provision of state law and even a college degree can not be use to prove that can read and write for the fact be that the only way to pass these barrier be to show a white skin experience have clearly show that the exist process of law can not overcome systematic and ingenious discrimination no law that now have on the book and have help to put of there can ensure the right to vote when local official be determined to deny in such a case duty must be clear to all of the constitution say that no person shall be keep from vote because of race or color have all swear an oath before god to support and to defend that constitution must now act in obedience to that oath wednesday will send to congress a law design to eliminate illegal barrier to the right to vote the broad principle of that bill will be in the hand of the democratic and republican leader tomorrow after have review will come here formally as a bill be grateful for this opportunity to come here tonight at the invitation of the leadership to reason with friend to give view and to visit with former colleague have have prepare a more comprehensive analysis of the legislation which have intend to transmit to the clerk tomorrow but which will submit to the clerk tonight but want to really discuss with now briefly the main proposal of this legislation this bill will strike down restriction to voting in all election federal state and local â€” which have be use to deny negroes the right to vote this bill will establish a simple uniform standard which can not be use however ingenious the effort to flout constitution will provide for citizen to be register by official of the|united|states|government if the state official refuse to register will eliminate tedious unnecessary lawsuit which delay the right to vote finally this legislation will ensure that properly register individual be not prohibit from voting will welcome the suggestion from all of the members of congress â€” have no doubt that will get some â€” on way and mean to strengthen this law and to make effective but experience have plainly show that this be the only path to carry out the command of the constitution to those who seek to avoid action by national|government in own community who want to and who seek to maintain purely local control over election the answer be simple open polling place to all people allow man and woman to register and vote whatever the color of skin extend the right of citizenship to every citizen of this land there be no constitutional issue here the command of the constitution be plain there be no moral issue be wrong deadly wrong to deny any of fellow americans the right to vote in this country there be no issue of states right or national right there be only the struggle for human right have not the slight doubt what will be answer the last time a president send a civil right bill to the congress contain a provision to protect voting right in federal election that civil right bill be pass after eight|long|month of debate and when that bill come to desk from the congress for signature the heart of the voting provision have be eliminate this time on this issue there must be no delay no hesitation and no compromise with purpose can not must not refuse to protect the right of every american to vote in every election that may desire to participate in and ought not and can not and must not wait another|8|month before get a bill have already wait a|hundred|years and more and the time for wait be go so ask to join in work long hour â€” night and weekend if necessary to pass this bill and do not make that request lightly for from the window where sit with the problem of country recognize that outside this chamber be the outraged conscience of a nation the grave concern of many nation and the harsh judgment of history on act but even if pass this bill the battle will not be over what happen in selma be part of a far large movement which reach into every section and state|of|america be the effort of to secure for the full blessing of american life cause must be cause too because be not just negroes but really be all of who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice and shall overcome as a man whose root go deeply into southern soil know how agonize racial feeling be know how difficult be to reshape the attitude and the structure of society but a century have pass since the negro be free and be not fully free tonight be more|than|a|hundred|years|ago that a great president of another party sign but emancipation be a proclamation and not a fact a century have pass since equality be promise and yet the negro be not equal a century have pass since of promise and the promise be unkept the time of justice have now come tell that believe sincerely that no force can hold back be right in the eye of man and god that should come and when do think that|day will brighten the life of every american for negroes be not the only victim how many white child have go uneducated how many white family have live in stark poverty how many white life have be scar by fear because have waste energy and substance to maintain the barrier of hatred and terror so say to all of here and to all in the nation tonight that those who appeal to to hold on to the past do so at the cost of deny future this great rich restless country can offer opportunity and education and hope to all black and white north|and|south sharecropper and city dweller these be the enemy poverty ignorance disease be the enemy and not fellow man not neighbor and these enemy too poverty disease and ignorance shall overcome now let none of in any section look with prideful righteousness on the trouble in another section or on the problem of neighbor there be really no part of america where the promise of equality have be fully keep in buffalo as well as in birmingham in philadelphia as well as in selma americans be struggle for the fruit of freedom this be nation what happen in selma or in cincinnati be a matter of legitimate concern to every american but let each of look within own heart and own community and

nation demonstration have be design to call attention to injustice design to provoke change design to stir reform have call upon to make good the promise of america and who among can say that would have make the same progress be not for persistent bravery and faith in american democracy for at the real heart of battle for equality be a deep seat belief in the democratic process equality depend not on the force of arm or tear gas but upon the force of moral right not on recourse to violence but on respect for law and order there have be many pressure upon president and there will be other as the day come and go but pledge tonight that intend to fight this battle where should be fight in the court and in the congress and in the heart of man must preserve the right of free speech and the

in recognition of this that man of both race have show such an outstandingly impressive responsibility in recent|days last|tuesday again today the bill that be present to will be know as a civil right

and be go to give that right all americans must have the privilege of citizenship regardless of race and be go to have those privilege of citizenship regardless of race but would like to caution and remind that to exercise these privilege take much more than just legal right require a train mind and a healthy body require a decent home and the chance to find a job and the opportunity to escape from the clutch of poverty of course people can not contribute to the nation if be never teach to read or write if body be stunt from hunger if sickness go untended if life be spend in hopeless

young child never think then in that would be stand here in never even occur to in fond dream that may have the chance to help the son and daughter of those student and to help people like all over this country but now do have that chance and will let in on a secret mean to use and hope that will use with this be the rich and most powerful country which ever occupy the globe the might of past empire be little compare to but do not want to be the president who build empire or seek grandeur or extend dominion want to be the president who educate young child to the wonder of world want to be the president who help to feed the hungry and to prepare to be taxpayer instead of tax eater want to be the president who help the poor to find own way and who protect the right of every citizen to vote in every election want to be the president who help to end hatred among fellow man and who promote love among the people of all race and all region and all party want to be the president who help

conference include red|china and to discuss possible change in the|united|nation would comment on that please the president have only see the very brief press report regard general de|gaulle 's conference which apparently have just conclude before this meeting and would much prefer to await a full report on the exact statement before get into any detailed discussion involve the general 's observation be the position of this country however believe that the problem of the|united|nation be traceable not to the|united|nations|charter but to those country which have violate either the spirit or the letter of the charter because believe that the framework for world progress and peace be in the charter and will be glad to respectfully review any observation the general have make and give due consideration to mr. president there have be some criticism both abroad and here because vice president humphrey be not send to london to the churchill funeral would care to go into reason and what motivate in select the american delegation the president well at first think would hope that would be able to go if physical condition permit ask that defer final decision until the doctor could act but have staff contact president truman and president eisenhower and express the hope could accompany president truman be unable to go and president eisenhower inform that have accept the invitation of the family and would be go and that would be in attendance and would be do other thing there urge that go with in delegation and send a plane to california to pick up at the same time

represent this country but there be many representative from many walk of life do review the list of delegate represent country at the churchill funeral and do not observe that other nation send in most instance either top man or the next man necessarily think have a rather well round delegation in the former president the secretary of state the senator who be present the chief justice of supreme|court in the light of interest and other interest may have make a mistake by ask the chief justice to go and not ask the vice president will bear in mind in connection with any future funeral very strong feeling in the matter and try to act in accordance with national interest q. mr. president since last news conference there have be a considerable number of development in viet nam mr. bundy be currently there wonder if could speak generally to about viet nam and attitude toward these late development the president yes there have be no change in the position of this country in regard to desire or determination to help the people of viet nam preserve freedom frequently observe to the people of this country that basic commitment to viet nam be make in a statement by president to the general effect that would help the people of viet nam help now have difficulty from day to day and sometimes increase with the hour and have mr. bundy out in viet nam now on a regular exchange of view with spokesman and representative in that area normally about every week or ask ambassador and military adviser to bring a full exchange of view general taylor be here believe in july and again in september and maybe in december and be due to come back here in february in the light of the recent development out there think that would be well if mr. bundy come out there at this particular time than for to take the time out for a trip back to the|united|state so in accordance with suggestion recommend that mr. bundy go there and that general taylor bring up to date on the military situation in that country on the political situation in that country and give view as to what course should be in try to continue to be more effective and efficient in aid the people of viet nam to preserve freedom mr. bundy will be back on the|weekend no doubt will bring with all the information that be available to people and will be glad to make as much of that information available as be in the national interest only want to reassert this|morn determination to continue present policy the policy of government from the beginning to try to help the people of viet nam help to preserve freedom q. mr. president in this connection sir have address to the political and military situation of viet nam but the diplomatic situation there seem to have turn some corner with the announcement that mr. kosygin be go to hanoi wonder sir could assess for the possible significance of that visit in term both of commitment to south|viet nam and in term of the broad effect on east west relation the president the kosygin visit and implication and significance could best be interpret by mr. kosygin visit to south|viet nam be require by regular practice of exchange view every|6|week or have nothing whatever to do with the kosygin visit be plan before have information of the kosygin visit what the purpose of mr. kosygin and what the result of visit to peiping or hanoi will be be unknown to at this time will have to await development to see what flow from those meeting q. mr. president as understand be in south|viet nam at the invitation and request of the|south|vietnamese|government yesterday there be a dispatch from paris say that north|vietnamese and south|vietnamese official be explore behind the scene the possibility of a negotiate settlement what happen if be invite to leave south|viet nam by the|south|vietnamese|government the president would not anticipate that would receive such an invitation would comment only on the dispatch that come from unknown and unauthorized and rather think uninformed source in paris in judgment that dispatch have no validity and like a good many be completely untrue believe that will continue as say before to do very good to make effort in viet nam more efficient and more effective in help the people of viet nam to help would not want to speculate on what may be it- this situation happen or that situation happen would want to cross that bridge when come to but do not anticipate cross any such bridge as be indicate by the dispatch from paris q. do that mean sir that be oppose to the suggestion of the senators of own party notably senator gore and mr. church recommend the exploration of a negotiate settlement the president mean that position think be abundantly clear that be there to be as effective and efficient as can in help the people of south|viet nam resist aggression and preserve freedom will find from time to time that senator from both the democratic and the|republican|party will have different viewpoint to which be entitle and will express as have express q. mr. president sir have give any consideration to modify order on the closing of veteran hospital in light of the congressional opposition the president yes give a good deal of consideration to the action of the|veterans|administration in close the installation that recommend be close in the interest of saving and economy and the interest of the veteran this recommendation be first make by mr. gleason who have serve many|years as administrator|of|veterans|affair mr. gleason 's recommendation be send to the appropriate people in the|budget|bureau and study and agree with mr. gleason and refer to the president with view upon the receipt of those recommendation carefully study and send to the new veterans|administrator mr. driver for study and consideration and any action that care to take mr. driver make a very careful study of each of the installation and make rather full recommendation back through the appropriate official in forward mr. driver 's recommendation back to the|white|house and ask an independent attorney of very judicious temperament and a good many year experience in handle public property and land and installation to make an independent study of each of the installation and each of the consolidation prepare for a memorandum in which concur in mr. gleason 's recommendation in mr. driver 's recommendation in the director of the budget 's recommendation and say that the public interest require that the|veterans|administrator take the action that propose to take have hear from most of the representative of the community involve have hear from a good many of the people who live in those community recognize the economic impact of the closing of these installation and the hardship that bring in some instance be do what can to minimize that hardship do not feel that be justified in take the taxpayer ' money to support a hospital that in many instance the people feel should not have be so locate to begin with in some instance be not modern in other instance the head of the medical facility of the|veterans|administration urge that never establish to begin with because could not attract outstanding military and professional medical people and be judgment that be not justified in pay or a day more to keep veteran service connect or non - service connect in of these small hospital when could get the good modern medicine available at a much cheap cost in a hospital in the area now congress may have a different viewpoint have observe that have ask to permit the|independent|offices|committee of the|senate|appropriations|committee to look further into the chairman of the|house|veterans|committee be consult before take this action and propose to make a close study of now in the house as have do in the senate will of course supply all the information have and will receive all the information that anyone else have to offer and will always be glad to give consideration but the judgment have make insofar as can now determine be make on the good fact available and do not believe that the national interest of all of people justify the waste that will occur if satisfy the narrow local requirement as desirable as may be to the local community do not necessarily serve the national interest q. mr. president can tell what the doctor report on health since illness last|week the president take blood pressure practically every|morning look at throat the comment now be think be do very well and most of the symptom of the infection have be go although do not feel as bouncy as do

report the president no never indicate want to wait for the senate say that be a matter for the senate and that be what would repeat q. mr. president in light of president kennedy 's much state view that think the moral leadership on these ethical question should come from the|white|house wonder if would like to give opinion now on bobby|baker when be assistant and the time afterward the president no would not care to make a comment about a matter that be under investigation in a senate committee and be be thoroughly study by a local grand jury have state at various time that the question have be raise that think that this be a matter for the senate to study and if there have be any violation of the law for the grand jury and the fbi and the|department|of|justice to take appropriate action now have refer to the fbi any and all information of a substantive nature that have come to attention in this regard that information be be present to the grand jury and be be or
