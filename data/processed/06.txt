jim|baker to return to the|middle|east to obtain israel 's answer to proposal for peace and again thank to and would be prepared to take question along with sir yugoslavia q. question to comrade gorbachev say that talk with mr. bush about yugoslavia what be the essence of that conversation about yugoslavia and mr. bush when receive in the|white|house in capacity at that time as vice president of the|united|states|of|america say to that the relation between country there be a special relationship between yugoslavia and the|united|state be that definition still valid and whether the|united|state be still support yugoslavian territorial integrity thank president gorbachev ask about the essence of the conversation will then make use of the fact that will relate the content of the u.s.-soviet statement on yugoslavia this be the result of conversation on this subject both country with a deep concern have note the dramatic development of event in yugoslavia and have be against the use of force and call upon all side to abide by the agreement on the cease fire the|soviet|union and the u.s. proceed from the premise that the resolution of issue must be find by the people of yugoslavia on the basis of democratic principle through peaceful negotiation and a constructive approach emphasize the necessity of have all side respect the basic principle indicate in the|helsinki|act and the|paris|charter the u.s. and the u.s.s.r. support the effort undertake by the csce country specifically step to resolve the problem this be the essence of the statement president bush would only add sir that inasmuch as that be a joint statement that express continued position as well middle east peace talk q. mr. president can ask the fact that be go ahead with this peace conference do that mean that have israel 's acceptance of the outline of condition for a peace conference or be there still a hangup or have get a commitment from mr. shamir president bush well would wait and let secretary baker answer that question after this next meeting and if have to express a degree of optimism or pessimism would say be a little more optimistic today but the visit of jim|baker now be for what say here to obtain israel 's answer to proposal for peace and if have the answer in pocket or do would expect that would say so soviet u.s. relation q. have a question to both president discuss many question of international issue bilateral issue sign a unique agreement today what do leave for the next meeting and can say when be plan to have president gorbachev think that what discuss today and what have set in motion both with regard to a political dialog and a continuation of the disarmament process and new subject in the area of economic cooperation and trade interaction in the resolution of important issue include regional conflict which unfortunately still take place and especially since have begin a significant discussion about the concept of future strategic stability that mean that have many issue to discuss and many meeting ahead so think that contact will continue but would express in favor of the follow perhaps not always can go and this make the position of president very specific but be hard for than for the ministers of foreign affairs to travel and discuss issue of foreign affair but nevertheless the president and have develop a method of conversation exchange opinion by telephone as soon as have a need concern or simply to exchange opinion about something important do this by telephone and this take place on a regular basis and secondly regularly exchange letter and this exchange of opinion have not cease even in recent|day when have already reach agreement with the president be expect here so have many channel in order to support this very high level of cooperation which have and think a great role will be give to department the|ministries|of|foreign|affairs but other departments as well because have new area of cooperation president bush would only add to that that though no date be set be view and have not always hold this view that a meeting without an agenda be a good idea from time to time between the soviet president and the president of the|united|state and with this president gorbachev talk about arm control and regional problem and other problem but as this dynamic autonomy begin to move a chance for a dynamic economy here there be go to be much more to talk about on the economic side than have ever have before cooperation partnership joint venture the whole approach to economic that have endorse that be go to benefit believe the|soviet|union and think there be enormous potential for the|united|state so be view that have get plenty to talk about and for would be prepared to as have state before to have a meeting where there be not a crisis out there to be manage rather can be sure that be not ship pass in the|night the analogy use believe in malta appropriately laughter and look forward to future meeting because get a lot do where can not put out sign a program or a 20-point protocol but a lot be do just by the kind of conversation have have today lithuania q. president gorbachev there be an ugly border incident in lithuania last|night in which a number of lithuanian border guard be kill wonder if could have reaction and any explanation may have of also president bush any reaction from in light particularly of call yesterday afternoon for freedom for the|baltic|state president gorbachev know receive this information when be talk outside the city the first information be such that the incident be on the border between lithuania and byelorussia and when of the citizen of byelorussia go in the direction of lithuania and at the custom point where be approach see wound people and that die quickly relate this information and now the state security agency of lithuania and byelorussia the chairman of the state committee on security offer also to help in the cooperation so now be investigate this must say that in addition to regret must simply sympathize with the family of the people that die and must say that be do everything in order not only to take action but also to avoid such excess such conflict on the basis of resolution of basic issue and have take such basic mutual decision with regard to issue concern armenia and azerbaijan there be a dialog and the fast and more productive the dialog be the more effort there be to break down not everyone like this process that be develop in such a direction and be hard for to say what happen hear version the president and but these be version this be not important at any rate will be monitor this and will tell what be that happen in reality q. just want to get reaction sir to the incident in light of call yesterday afternoon for freedom for the|baltic|state president bush well do not think there be a connection but do regret the violence listen to what president gorbachev say about the discussion clearly favor negotiation know that that would lead to a reduction of cross - border violence from both side and obviously would like to join in express regret to those family whose love one be lose but the president immediately get on this and say be conduct an investigation think there be hope that the investigation will be cooperative between the lithuanian side and byelorussia 's side and so can not prejudge the incident but have an opportunity to express view to president gorbachev on the whole question of the|baltic|state do not think be fair to link a border incident before know what happen to that question however soviet economic integration q. mr. president how far do go after london in move ahead in the integration of the u.s.s.r. into the international economy be there progress reach in this area to both president president gorbachev perhaps can begin president bush well let say that be a serious objective to start with secondly believe that active participation in these international financial institution and the status that be deem good by the|g|-|7 be the most important thing that the soviets can do right now have free up as hear today certain trade benefit or normalize the trade procedure that in view will help and have do that since the meeting in london but the answer be full participation full benefit of these international institution require full knowledge and step towards the privatization and toward convertability all the thing that believe the|soviet|union want so work with the international organization and then bilaterally do what have do and other country will be do too be sure to remove the underbrush remove the barrier to bilateral economic cooperation so quite a bit have happen between since paris and look forward with representative in these international organization to work very cooperatively with the soviet leader president gorbachev understand that be suppose to comment on this as well since the question be to both president will be brief since have already express opinion about this london be the beginning of a very important process this be the meaning of the london meeting and one must judge about this in that light be very important that after london there be a desire on both part to work out a mechanism which would permit the shifting of this cooperation give the political will of the leadership of the western country in the|soviet|union think that should have special structure which would keep tab of the cooperation between the|soviet|union and the g country and first of all in the area of investment so the process would be easy in the taking of decision of mutual interest and be good that the mechanism have start to be implement which discuss in london and the minister of finances|of|england be already here first talk about the fact that there would be visit of the minister of finance the secretary of the treasury of the u.s. and the representative of the frg so in other word there would be the mechanism of implement specific area of cooperation and this be very important that there be a mechanism for real interaction and finally the president mention that on the part of the u.s. an important decision will be take to make trade between country easy would say that mention this in pass but often discuss this with the president ask and agree to study the question of cocom restriction today because many dollar project which be ready to go and even sign be not be implement because of the fact that have element that come under cocom restriction and therefore a very serious process have start and think that this will continue and grow strong be more specific will give result there be a will and a desire to do this be very important nuclear weapon q. would ask both of to think back to the reykjavik summit when ronald|reagan horrify quite a few american nuclear expert and almost all of the european leader by give serious consideration to proposal president gorbachev for a ban on all nuclear weapon in the end reagan say no because of the belief that nuclear deterrence have in fact keep the peace at that time have a massive conventional edge in europe though since then have have the cfe treaty why now be the of not say will now work towards a total nuclear ban do still believe in the efficacy of nuclear deterrence in keep the peace particularly sir ask president bush give the fact that some of these breakaway republics have nuclear weapon in there and who know what would happen if declare independence president bush the very fact that would not suggest that a breakaway republic be go to use a nuclear weapon against the|united|state but would suggest that have every reason in the world to be concern about renegade not in these area perhaps hope not get hold of nuclear weapon and that be of the reason strongly support gpals program that be be debate in the senate right now but in view other country do possess nuclear weapon be not just the|soviet|union and the|united|state and do believe that be on the right path by the path that president gorbachev have outline today on follow on exist agreement so rather than try to have a ethereal or a utopian answer let follow through practically as suggest and then as far as the u.s. be concern would like to go forward with a system that put nobody at threat nobody at risk the only thing at risk be an errant nuclear missile aim at a country and that be why support the defensive approach and that be why think of the lesson out of the|iraq|war and maybe president gorbachev read this differently be that defense work and though be talk about a different concept now an expand concept a more high tech concept think a lot of life be save by defense so that be reply president gorbachev will say a few word think that the argument which want to ascribe to that in policy look upon nuclear weapon as an element of deterrence be not true have not say this yes get involve in the arm race in a very serious way thank god as say in russian that stop this and turn back and this be a great accomplishment since understand where be head but be hard to resolve all these issue which have pile up and all these weapon that have pile up and think that there be still a lot that have to do have map out a few thing for the future and then there will probably also be question put to all member of the nuclear club and also have to think about what to do with nuclear weapon in the future and finally must very carefully act about have the mechanism which have create and which seem have work but apparently not effectively enough about nonproliferation of nuclear weapon this be of the important topic of conversation with the president during these|days for if certain country will lower arm and disarm and head in the direction of a nonnuclear world and at the same time other will find way to develop the process in order to have own nuclear weapon then will have a situation which be absurd so in continue to support nuclear disarmament and within the framework of the negotiation process which have have agree to continue this have the question of truly improve the mechanism of nonproliferation nuclear technology in order missile technology in order to create an unsurmountable barrier in this area think this be of the most important thing have to do today q. what significance do the process of european integration have in conversation with the president for example the postwar unification of europe what image of this be the most acceptable to from the point of view of the|soviet|union for example the image of a general de|gaulle|europe of fatherland country with decision be make on a national level or a united state of europe with common decision be make among thank europe president gorbachev first of all can probably guess that everything that happen in europe in the world have always look towards europe for everything that happen in europe in area do not want to list have a great importance for the development in the world so undoubtedly the president and note the positive development which be take place in europe and note support of the document aim at create a new europe and see that the|soviet|union and the u.s. must participate very actively in build a new europe all of this have exist and continue to exist and feel a responsibility to do this but ask the question about how think perhaps be a little hasty because when be create a certain schematic and then try to impose then get result when a process be be develop in a logical way within the helsinki process a political process of choice then find that new form of cooperation and new institute come into being now would say the follow must within the framework of the document the general path map out in the helsinki and the paris agreement act in such a way that the old institution be transform in the interest of a new europe so that serve the interest of a single economic territory a single security of europe a legal aspect and so this be what must aim for that mean when the old institution when change have to bear this in mind but apparently will also have new institution which will arise which will serve this process and now if have for example a common energy approach there will be mechanism of administer this and will have a great significance in the fate of europe and the process to realize this thus in go along this path without destroy the old institution in create new one probably will find the form gradually to resolve these issue but if declare a specific course but will keep the old structure institution without change at all then again there can be a process of simply regrouping of force in europe and there can be new confrontation which would come into be with a different distribution of force be not in favor of this so would more quickly go through the process of creation of new institution and would stimulate those tendency which would move towards a united europe do not think that here need to have language vanish culture tradition vanish think this would be a mistake if set such a goal think should take into consideration those specific characteristic and tradition the history of the people but also aim for unification think this be compatible although see that there be also an explosion of nationalism separatism effort to unravel everything this be a dangerous process think that if follow a path of chaotic development of such process then will get into a bad situation so be for the transformation of all institution be for new institution which would act in the interest of unification process in europe mr. fitzwater use allot time thank very much & nbsp president gorbachev good evening lady and gentleman the basic part of the visit the official visit of the president of the|united|states|of|america to the|soviet|union be behind and there be many thing that be important which be still ahead within the framework of this big political international event these day be full of very substantial dialog over a wide spectrum of issue and must say that be kind of difficult for at this point president bush 's earphone for translation fail guess will have to repeat from the very beginning what say in that case laughter q. number mr. president laughter president gorbachev now do hear now be everything okay be tolerable already say address the international press that see the official visit of the president of the|united|state to the|soviet|union as a big

the president and the press be the host and maybe misuse but perhaps could listen to comment as well that be speak so much understand that almost agree with everything have say laughter president bush what hear like laughter once again this may be an appropriate time for barbara and to thank the president and mrs. gorbachev for this fantastic hospitality and yes could not agree more about the productive nature of the talk the enhancement of mutual understanding this be not diplomatic language in view this be fact know view on the start agreement indeed be the culmination of a long and historic negotiation and happen to believe that the winner on this be the young people not just in the|soviet|union not just in the|united|state but all around the world and be take major step in

palestinians and believe there be an historic opportunity right now to launch a process that can lead to a just and endure peace and to a comprehensive settlement in the|middle|east share the strong conviction that this historic opportunity must not be lose and while recognize that peace can not be impose can only result from direct negotiation between the party the|united|state and the|soviet|union pledge to do utmost to promote and sustain the peacemaking process and to that end the|united|state and the|soviet|union act as cosponsor be go to work to convene an october peace

secretary baker and foreign minister bessmertnykh will continue to work with the party to prepare for this conference and be today ask secretary of state jim|baker to return to the|middle|east to obtain israel 's answer to proposal for peace and again thank to and would be prepared to take question along with sir yugoslavia q. question to comrade gorbachev say that talk with mr. bush about yugoslavia what be the essence of that conversation about yugoslavia and mr. bush when receive in the|white|house in capacity at that time as vice president of the|united|states|of|america say to that the relation between country there be a special relationship between yugoslavia and the|united|state be that definition still valid and whether the|united|state be still support yugoslavian territorial integrity thank president gorbachev ask about the essence of the conversation will then make use of the fact that will relate the content of the u.s.-soviet statement on yugoslavia this be the result of conversation on this subject both country with a deep concern have note the dramatic development of event in yugoslavia and have be against the use of force and call upon all side to abide by the agreement on the cease fire the|soviet|union and the u.s. proceed from the premise that the resolution of issue must be find by the people of yugoslavia on the basis of democratic principle through peaceful negotiation and a constructive approach emphasize the necessity of have all side respect the basic principle indicate in the|helsinki|act and the|paris|charter the u.s. and the u.s.s.r. support the effort undertake by the csce country specifically step to resolve the problem this be the essence of the statement president bush would only add sir that inasmuch as that be a joint statement that express continued position as well middle east peace talk q. mr. president can ask the fact that be go ahead with this peace conference do that mean that have israel 's acceptance of the outline of condition for a peace conference or be there still a hangup or have get a commitment from mr. shamir president bush well would wait and let secretary baker answer that question after this next meeting and if have to express a degree of optimism or pessimism would say be a little more optimistic today but the visit of jim|baker now be for what say here to obtain israel 's answer to proposal for peace and if have the answer in pocket or do would expect that would say so soviet u.s. relation q. have a question to both president discuss many question of international issue bilateral issue sign a unique agreement today what do leave for the next meeting and can say when be plan to have president gorbachev think that what discuss today and what have set in motion both with regard to a political dialog and a continuation of the disarmament process and new subject in the area of economic cooperation and trade interaction in the resolution of important issue include regional conflict which unfortunately still take place and especially since have begin a significant discussion about the concept of future strategic stability that mean that have many issue to discuss and many meeting ahead so think that contact will continue but would express in favor of the follow perhaps not always can go and this make the position of president very specific but be hard for than for the ministers of foreign affairs to travel and discuss issue of foreign affair but nevertheless the president and have develop a method of conversation exchange opinion by telephone as soon as have a need concern or simply to exchange opinion about something important do this by telephone and this take place on a regular basis and secondly regularly exchange letter and this exchange of opinion have not cease even in recent|day when have already reach agreement with the president be expect here so have many channel in order to support this very high level of cooperation which have and think a great role will be give to department the|ministries|of|foreign|affairs but other departments as well because have new area of cooperation president bush would only add to that that though no date be set be view and have not always hold this view that a meeting without an agenda be a good idea from time to time between the soviet president and the president of the|united|state and with this president gorbachev talk about arm control and regional problem and other problem but as this dynamic autonomy begin to move a chance for a dynamic economy here there be go to be much more to talk about on the economic side than have ever have before cooperation partnership joint venture the whole approach to economic that have endorse that be go to benefit believe the|soviet|union and think there be enormous potential for the|united|state so be view that have get plenty to talk about and for would be prepared to as have state before to have a meeting where there be not a crisis out there to be manage rather can be sure that be not ship pass in the|night the analogy use believe in malta appropriately laughter and look forward to future meeting because get a lot do where can not put out sign a program or a 20-point protocol but a lot be do just by the kind of conversation have have today lithuania q. president gorbachev there be an ugly border incident in lithuania last|night in which a number of lithuanian border guard be kill wonder if could have reaction and any explanation may have of also president bush any reaction from in light particularly of call yesterday afternoon for freedom for the|baltic|state president gorbachev know receive this information when be talk outside the city the first information be such that the incident be on the border between lithuania and byelorussia and when of the citizen of byelorussia go in the direction of lithuania and at the custom point where be approach see wound people and that die quickly relate this information and now the state security agency of lithuania and byelorussia the chairman of the state committee on security offer also to help in the cooperation so now be investigate this must say that in addition to regret must simply sympathize with the family of the people that die and must say that be do everything in order not only to take action but also to avoid such excess such conflict on the basis of resolution of basic issue and have take such basic mutual decision with regard to issue concern armenia and azerbaijan there be a dialog and the fast and more productive the dialog be the more effort there be to break down not everyone like this process that be develop in such a direction and be hard for to say what happen hear version the president and but these be version this be not important at any rate will be monitor this and will tell what be that happen in reality q. just want to get reaction sir to the incident in light of call yesterday afternoon for freedom for the|baltic|state president bush well do not think there be a connection but do regret the violence listen to what president gorbachev say about the discussion clearly favor negotiation know that that would lead to a reduction of cross - border violence from both side and obviously would like to join in express regret to those family whose love one be lose but the president immediately get on this and say be conduct an investigation think there be hope that the investigation will be cooperative between the lithuanian side and byelorussia 's side and so can not prejudge the incident but have an opportunity to express view to president gorbachev on the whole question of the|baltic|state do not think be fair to link a border incident before know what happen to that question however soviet economic integration q. mr. president how far do go after london in move ahead in the integration of the u.s.s.r. into the international economy be there progress reach in this area to both president president gorbachev perhaps can begin president bush well let say that be a serious objective to start with secondly believe that active participation in these international financial institution and the status that be deem good by the|g|-|7 be the most important thing that the soviets can do right now have free up as hear today certain trade benefit or normalize the trade procedure that in view will help and have do that since the meeting in london but the answer be full participation full benefit of these international institution require full knowledge and step towards the privatization and toward convertability all the thing that believe the|soviet|union want so work with the international organization and then bilaterally do what have do and other country will be do too be sure to remove the underbrush remove the barrier to bilateral economic cooperation so quite a bit have happen between since paris and look forward with representative in these international organization to work very cooperatively with the soviet leader president gorbachev understand that be suppose to comment on this as well since the question be to both president will be brief since have already express opinion about this london be the beginning of a very important process this be the meaning of the london meeting and one must judge about this in that light be very important that after london there be a desire on both part to work out a mechanism which would permit the shifting of this cooperation give the political will of the leadership of the western country in the|soviet|union think that should have special structure which would keep tab of the cooperation between the|soviet|union and the g country and first of all in the area of investment so the process would be easy in the taking of decision of mutual interest and be good that the mechanism have start to be implement which discuss in london and the minister of finances|of|england be already here first talk about the fact that there would be visit of the minister of finance the secretary of the treasury of the u.s. and the representative of the frg so in other word there would be the mechanism of implement specific area of cooperation and this be very important that there be a mechanism for real interaction and finally the president mention that on the part of the u.s. an important decision will be take to make trade between country easy would say that mention this in pass but often discuss this with the president ask and agree to study the question of cocom restriction today because many dollar project which be ready to go and even sign be not be implement because of the fact that have element that come under cocom restriction and therefore a very serious process have start and think that this will continue and grow strong be more specific will give result there be a will and a desire to do this be very important nuclear weapon q. would ask both of to think back to the reykjavik summit when ronald|reagan horrify quite a few american nuclear expert and almost all of the european leader by give serious consideration to proposal president gorbachev for a ban on all nuclear weapon in the end reagan say no because of the belief that nuclear deterrence have in fact keep the peace at that time have a massive conventional edge in europe though since then have have the cfe treaty why now be the of not say will now work towards a total nuclear ban do still believe in the efficacy of nuclear deterrence in keep the peace particularly sir ask president bush give the fact that some of these breakaway republics have nuclear weapon in there and who know what would happen if declare independence president bush the very fact that would not suggest that a breakaway republic be go to use a nuclear weapon against the|united|state but would suggest that have every reason in the world to be concern about renegade not in these area perhaps hope not get hold of nuclear weapon and that be of the reason strongly support gpals program that be be debate in the senate right now but in view other country do possess nuclear weapon be not just the|soviet|union and the|united|state and do believe that be on the right path by the path that president gorbachev have outline today on follow on exist agreement so rather than try to have a ethereal or a utopian answer let follow through practically as suggest and then as far as the u.s. be concern would like to go forward with a system that put nobody at threat nobody at risk the only thing at risk be an errant nuclear missile aim at a country and that be why support the defensive approach and that be why think of the lesson out of the|iraq|war and maybe president gorbachev read this differently be that defense work and though be talk about a different concept now an expand concept a more high tech concept think a lot of life be save by defense so that be reply president gorbachev will say a few word think that the argument which want to ascribe to that in policy look upon nuclear weapon as an element of deterrence be not true have not say this yes get involve in the arm race in a very serious way thank god as say in russian that stop this and turn back and this be a great accomplishment since understand where be head but be hard to resolve all these issue which have pile up and all these weapon that have pile up and think that there be still a lot that have to do have map out a few thing for the future and then there will probably also be question put to all member of the nuclear club and also have to think about what to do with nuclear weapon in the future and finally must very carefully act about have the mechanism which have create and which seem have work but apparently not effectively enough about nonproliferation of nuclear weapon this be of the important topic of conversation with the president during these|days for if certain country will lower arm and disarm and head in the direction of a nonnuclear world and at the same time other will find way to develop the process in order to have own nuclear weapon then will have a situation which be absurd so in continue to support nuclear disarmament and within the framework of the negotiation process which have have agree to continue this have the question of truly improve the mechanism of nonproliferation nuclear technology in order missile technology in order to create an unsurmountable barrier in this area think this be of the most important thing have to do today q. what significance do the process of european integration have in conversation with the president for example the postwar unification of europe what image of this be the most acceptable to from the point of view of the|soviet|union for example the image of a general de|gaulle|europe of fatherland country with decision be make on a national level or a united state of europe with common decision be make among thank europe president gorbachev first of all can probably guess that everything that happen in europe in the world have always look towards europe for everything that happen in europe in area do not want to list have a great importance for the development in the world so undoubtedly the president and note the positive development which be take place in europe and note support of the document aim at create a new europe and see that the|soviet|union and the u.s. must participate very actively in build a new europe all of this have exist and continue to exist and feel a responsibility to do this but ask the question about how think perhaps be a little hasty because when be create a certain schematic and then try to impose then get result when a process be be develop in a logical way within the helsinki process a political process of choice then find that new form of cooperation and new institute come into being now would say the follow must within the framework of the document the general path map out in the helsinki and the paris agreement act in such a way that the old institution be transform in the interest of a new europe so that serve the interest of a single economic territory a single security of europe a legal aspect and so this be what must aim for that mean when the old institution when change have to bear this in mind but apparently will also have new institution which will arise which will serve this process and now if have for example a common energy approach there will be mechanism of administer this and will have a great significance in the fate of europe and the process to realize this thus in go along this path without destroy the old institution in create new one probably will find the form gradually to resolve these issue but if declare a specific course but will keep the old structure institution without change at all then again there can be a process of simply regrouping of force in europe and there can be new confrontation which would come into be with a different distribution of force be not in favor of this so would more quickly go through the process of creation of new institution and would stimulate those tendency which would move towards a united europe do not think that here need to have language vanish culture tradition vanish think this would be a mistake if set such a goal think should take into consideration those specific characteristic and tradition the history of the people but also aim for unification think this be compatible although see that there be also an explosion of nationalism separatism effort to unravel everything this be a dangerous process think that if follow a path of chaotic development of such process then will get into a bad situation so be for the transformation of all institution be for new institution which would act in the interest of unification process in europe mr. fitzwater use allot time thank very much & nbsp view transcript transcript mr. president and mr. speaker thank sir for those very generous word speak from the heart about the wonderful performance of military member of congress come to this house to speak to about the state of the union meet then in time of war tonight meet in a

not unrealistic about the future but there be reason to be optimistic about economy first do not have to fight double digit inflation second most industry will not have to make big cut in production because do not have big inventory pile up and third export be run solid and strong in fact american business be export at a record rate so let put these time in perspective together since have create almost|20|million job cut inflation in half and cut interest rate in half and yes the large peacetime economic expansion in history have be temporarily interrupt but economy be still over twice as large as close competitor will get this recession behind and return to growth soon will get on way to a new record of expansion and achieve the competitive strength that will carry into the|next|american|century should focus effort today on encourage economic growth invest in the future and give power and opportunity to the individual must begin with control of federal spending that be why be submit a budget that hold the growth in spending to less than the rate of inflation and that be why amid all the sound and fury of last|year 's budget debate put into law new enforceable spending cap so that future spending debate will mean a battle of idea not a bidding war though controversial the budget agreement finally put the federal government on a pay as go plan and cut the

so tonight be ask the congressional leader and the|federal|reserve to cooperate with in a study lead by chairman alan|greenspan to sort out technical difference so that can avoid a return to unproductive partisan bickering but just as effort will bring economic growth now and in the future must also be match by long term investment for the|next|american|century that require a forward look plan of action and that be exactly what will be send to the congress have prepare a detailed series of proposal that include a budget that promote investment in america 's future in child education

these proposal must recognize that economic strength depend on be competitive in world market must continue to expand american export a successful uruguay round of world trade negotiation will create more real job and more real growth for all nation and know that if the playing field be level america 's worker and farmer can out work out produce anyone anytime anywhere and with a mexican free

across this country for term limitation be that the american people be increasingly concerned about big money influence in politic so must look beyond the next election to the next generation and the time have come to put the national interest above the special interest and to totally eliminate political action committee and that would truly put more competition in election and more power in the hand of individual and where power can not be put directly in the hand of the individual should be move closer to the people away from washington the federal government too often treat government program as if be of washington by washington and for washington once establish federal program seem to become immortal be time for a more dynamic program life cycle some program should increase some should decrease some should be terminate and some should be consolidate and turn over to the state budget include a list of program for potential turnover total more|than|$20|billion work with

say that have witness the unprecedented unity and cooperation of the|past|2|months that have never be prouder to have once serve within rank and never be prouder that the|united|states be the host country for the|united|nation year ago while the fire of an epic war still rage across ocean and continent a small group of man and woman begin a search for hope amid the ruin and gather in san|francisco step back from the haze and horror to try to shape a new structure that may support an ancient dream intensely idealistic and yet temper by war seek to build a new kind of bridge a bridge between nation a bridge that may help carry humankind from its|darkest|hour to bright day the founding of the united|nation embody deep hope for a peaceful world and during the|past|year have come closer than ever before to realize those hope have see a|century sunder by barbed threat and barbed wire give way to a new era of peace and competition and freedom the revolution of sweep the world almost with a life of own carry by a new breeze of freedom transform the political climate from central|europe to central|america and touch almost every corner of the globe that breeze have be sustain by a now almost universal recognition of a simple fundamental truth the human spirit can not be lock up forever the truth be people everywhere be motivate in much the same way and people everywhere want much the same thing the chance to live a life of purpose the chance to choose a life in which and child can learn and grow healthy worship freely and prosper through the work of hand and heart and mind be not talk about the power of nation but the power of individual the power to choose the power to risk the power to succeed this be a new and different world not since have see the real possibility of use the|united|nation as be design as a center for international collective security the change in the|soviet|union have be critical to the emergence of a strong united|nation the u.s.-soviet relationship be finally beyond containment and confrontation and now seek to fulfill the promise of mutually share understanding the long twilight struggle that for have divide europe nation and much of the world have come to an end much have change over the|last|2|years the|soviet|union have take many dramatic and important step to participate fully in the community of nation and when the|soviet|union agree with so many of here in the|united|nation to condemn the aggression of iraq there could be no doubt no doubt then that have indeed put four|decade of history behind be hopeful that the machinery of the|united|nation will no longer be freeze by the division that plague during the cold war that at last long last can build new bridge and tear down old wall that at long last will be able to build a new world base on an event for which have all hope an end to the cold war day from now the world will be watch when the cold war be formally bury in berlin and in this time of testing a fundamental question must be ask a question not for any nation but for the|united|nation and the question be this can work together in a new partnership of nation can the collective strength of the world community express by the|united|nation unite to deter and defeat aggression because the cold war 's battle of idea be not the last epic battle of this|century two|months|ago in the wane week of of history 's most hopeful summer the vast still beauty of the peaceful kuwaiti desert be foul by the stench of diesel and the roar of steel tank once again the sound of distant thunder echo across a cloudless sky and once again the world awake to face the gun of august but this time the world be ready the|united|nations|security|council 's resolute response to iraq 's unprovoked aggression have be without precedent since the invasion on august|2d the council have pass major resolution set the term for a solution to the crisis the iraqi regime have yet to face the fact but as say last|month the annexation of kuwait will not be permit to stand and this be not simply the view of the|united|state be the view of every kuwaiti the|united|nation iraq 's leader should listen be iraq against the world let take this opportunity to make the policy of government clear the|united|states support the use of sanction to compel iraq 's leader to withdraw immediately and without condition from kuwait also support the provision of medicine and food for humanitarian purpose so long as distribution can be properly monitor quarrel be not with the people of iraq do not wish for to suffer the world 's quarrel be with the dictator who order that invasion along with other have dispatch military force to the region to enforce sanction to deter and if nee be defend against further aggression and seek no advantage for nor do seek to maintain military force in saudi|arabia for 1|day longer than be necessary u.s. force be send at the request of the|saudi|government and the american people and this president want every single american soldier bring home as soon as this mission be complete let also emphasize that all of here at the u.n. hope that military force will never be use seek a peaceful outcome a diplomatic outcome and more thing in the aftermath of iraq 's unconditional departure from kuwait truly believe there may be opportunity for iraq and kuwait to settle difference permanently for the state of the gulf to build new arrangement for stability and for all the state and the people of the region to settle the conflict that divide the arabs from israel but the world 's key task now first and always must be to demonstrate that aggression will not be tolerate or reward through the|u.n.|security|council iraq have be fairly judge by a jury of peer the very nation of the earth today the regime stand isolate and out of step with the time separate from the civilized world not by space but by century iraq 's unprovoked aggression be a

america will not be intimidate vital issue of principle be at stake be literally try to wipe a country off the face of the earth do not exaggerate nor do exaggerate when say saddam|hussein will fail vital economic interest be at risk as well iraq control some|10|percent of the world 's prove oil reserve iraq plus kuwait control twice that an iraq permit to swallow kuwait would have the economic and military power as well as the arrogance to intimidate and coerce neighbor neighbor who control the lion 's share of the world 's remain oil reserve can not permit a resource so vital to be dominate by so ruthless and will not recent event have surely prove that there be no substitute for american leadership in the face of tyranny let no doubt american credibility and reliability let no one doubt stay power will stand by friend way or another the leader of iraq must learn this fundamental truth from the outset act hand in hand with other have seek to fashion the broad possible international response to iraq 's aggression the level of world cooperation and condemnation of iraq be unprecedented armed force from country span continent be there at the request of king|fahd of saudi|arabia to deter and if nee be to defend against attack moslem and non - moslems arabs and - arabs soldier from many nation stand shoulder to shoulder resolute against saddam|hussein 's ambition can now point to resolution that condemn iraq 's aggression call for iraq 's immediate and unconditional withdrawal the restoration of kuwait 's legitimate government and categorically reject iraq 's cynical and self serve attempt to annex kuwait finally the|united|nation have demand the release of all foreign national hold hostage against will and in contravention of international law be a mockery of human decency to call these people guest be hostage and the whole world know prime minister margaret|thatcher a dependable ally say all do not bargain over hostage will not stoop to the level of use human being as bargaining chip ever of course of course heart go out to the hostage and to family but policy can not change and will not change america and the world will not be blackmail by this ruthless policy be now in sight of a|united|nation that perform as envision by founder owe much to the outstanding leadership of secretary general javier|perez|de|cuellar the|united|nation be back up word with action the|security|council have impose mandatory economic sanction on iraq design to force iraq to relinquish the spoil of illegal conquest the|security|council have also take the decisive step of authorize the use of all mean necessary to ensure compliance with these sanction together with friend and ally ship of the|united|states|navy be today patrol mideast water have already intercept ship to enforce the sanction regional leader speak with just yesterday tell that these sanction be work iraq be feel the heat continue to hope that iraq 's leader will recalculate just what aggression have cost be cut off from world trade unable to sell oil and only a tiny fraction of good get through the communique with president gorbachev make mention of what happen when the embargo be so effective that child of iraq literally need milk or the sick truly need medicine then under strict international supervision that guarantee the proper destination then food will be permit at home the material cost of leadership can be steep that be why secretary of state baker and treasury secretary brady have meet with many world leader to underscore that the burden of this collective effort must be share be prepared to do share and more to help carry that load insist that other do share as well the response of most of friend and ally have be good to help defray cost the leader of saudi|arabia kuwait and the uae — the|united|arab|emirates have pledge to provide deploy troop with all the food and fuel need generous assistance will also be provide to stalwart front line nation such as turkey and egypt be also hearten to report that this international response extend to the neediest victim of this conflict — those refugee for part have contribute for relief effort this be but a portion of what be need commend in particular saudi|arabia japan and several european nation who have join in this purely humanitarian effort there be an energy relate cost to be bear as well oil produce nation be already replace lose iraqi and kuwaiti output more|than|half of what be lose have be make up and be get superb cooperation if producer include the|united|state continue step to expand oil and gas production can stabilize price and guarantee against hardship additionally and several of ally always have the option to extract oil from strategic petroleum reserve if condition warrant as have point out before conservation effort be essential to keep energy need as low as possible and must then take advantage of energy source across the board coal natural gas hydro and nuclear failure to do these thing have make more dependent on foreign oil than ever before finally let no one even contemplate profiteering from this crisis will not have can not predict just how long will take to convince iraq to withdraw from kuwait sanction will take time to have full intended effect will continue to review all option with ally but let be clear will not let this aggression stand interest involvement in the gulf be not transitory predate saddam|hussein 's aggression and will survive long after all troop come home and all hope be soon very soon — there will be a lasting role for the|united|state in assist the nation of the|persian|gulf role then to deter future aggression role be to help friend in own self defense and something else to curb the proliferation of chemical biological ballistic missile and above all nuclear technology let also make clear that the|united|states have no quarrel with the iraqi people quarrel be with iraq 's dictator and with aggression iraq will not be permit to annex kuwait that be not a threat that be not a boast that be just the way be go to be ability to function effectively as a great power abroad depend on how conduct at home economy armed|force energy dependence and cohesion all determine whether can help friend and stand up to foe for america to lead america must remain strong and vital world leadership and domestic strength be mutual and reinforce a weave piece strongly bind as to revitalize leadership leadership capacity must address budget deficit not after election|day or next|year but now high oil price slow growth and high defense cost would only make fiscal deficit problem bad that deficit be already great than should have be a project for the|coming|year must — will — be reduce to friend in congress together must act this very month before the|next|fiscal|year begin on october|1st to get america 's economic house in order the gulf situation help realize be more economically vulnerable than ever should be americans must never again enter any crisis economic or military with an excessive dependence on foreign oil and an excessive burden of federal debt most americans be sick and tired of endless battle in the congress and between the branch over budget matter be high time pull together and get the job do right be up to to straighten this out this job have basic part first the congress should this|month within a budget agreement enact growth orient tax measure to help avoid recession in the short term and to increase saving investment productivity and competitiveness for the long term these measure include extend incentive for research and experimentation expand the use of ira 's for new homeowner establish tax defer family saving account create incentive for the creation of enterprise zone and initiative to encourage more domestic drilling and yes reduce the tax rate on capital gain and second the congress should this|month enact a prudent multiyear defense program one that reflect not only the improvement in east west relation but broad responsibility to deal with the continue risk of outlaw action and regional conflict even with obligation in the gulf a sound defense budget can have some reduction in real term and be prepared to accept that but to go beyond such level where cut defense would threaten vital margin of safety be something will never accept the world be still dangerous and surely that be now clear stability be not secure american interest be far reach interdependence have increase the consequence of regional instability can be global this be no time to risk america 's capacity to protect vital interest and third the congress should this|month enact measure to increase domestic energy production and energy conservation in order to reduce dependence on foreign oil these measure should include proposal to increase incentive for domestic oil and gas exploration fuel switching and to accelerate the development of the alaskan energy resource without damage to wildlife as know when the oil embargo be impose in the|early|1970 's the|united|stat import almost|6|million|barrel of oil a day this|year before the iraqi invasion u.s. import have rise to nearly|8|million|barrel per day and would move in the wrong direction and now must act to correct that trend and fourth the congress should this|month enact a program to reduce the project debt and deficit by that be by half|a|trillion|dollars and if with the congress can develop a satisfactory program by the|end|of|the|month can avoid the ax of sequester deep across the board cut that would threaten military capacity and risk substantial domestic disruption want to be able to tell the american people that have truly solve the deficit problem and for to do that a budget agreement must meet these test must include the measure have recommend to increase economic growth and reduce dependence on foreign oil must be fair all should contribute but the burden should not be excessive for any group of program or people must address the growth of government 's hide liability must reform the budget process and further must be real urge congress to provide a comprehensive deficit reduction program to as a complete legislative package with measure to assure that can be fully enforce america be tired of phony deficit reduction or promise now save later plan be time for a program that be credible and real and finally to the extent that the deficit reduction program include new revenue measure must avoid any measure that would threaten economic growth or turn back toward the|days of punish income tax rate that be path should not head down again have be pleased with recent progress although have not always seem so smooth but now be time to produce hope can work out a responsible plan but with or without agreement from the budget summit ask both houses of the congress to allow a straight up or down vote on a complete deficit reduction package not if the congress can not get a budget then americans will have to face a tough mandate sequester be hopeful in fact be confident that the congress will do what should and can assure that in the executive branch will do part in the final analysis ability to meet responsibility abroad depend upon political will and consensus at home this be never easy in democracy for govern only with the consent of the govern and although free people in a free society be bind to have difference americans traditionally come together in time of adversity and challenge once again americans have step forward to share a tearful goodbye with family before leave for a strange and distant shore at this very moment serve together with arabs europeans asians and africans in defense of principle and the dream of a new world order that be why sweat and toil in the sand and the heat and the sun if can come together under such adversity if old adversary like the|soviet|union and the|united|state can work in common cause then surely who be so fortunate to be in this great chamber — democrats republicans liberal conservative can come together to fulfill responsibility here thank good night and god bless the|united|states|of|america view transcript transcript in the life of a nation be call upon to define who be and what believe sometimes these choice be not easy but today as president ask for support in a decision have make to stand up for what be right and condemn what be wrong all in the cause of peace at direction element of the|82d|airborne|division as well as key unit of the|united|states|air|force be arrive today to take up defensive position in saudi|arabia take this action to assist the|saudi|arabian|government in the defense of homeland no one commit america 's armed|force to a dangerous mission lightly but after perhaps unparalleled international consultation and exhaust every alternative become necessary to take this action let tell why less than a|week|ago in the|early|morning|hours of august iraqi|armed|force without provocation or warning invade a peaceful kuwait face negligible resistance from much small neighbor iraq 's tank storm in blitzkrieg fashion through kuwait in a|few|short|hours with more|than|100,000 troop along with tank artillery and surface to surface missile iraq now occupy kuwait this aggression come just|hours after saddam|hussein specifically assure numerous country in the area that there would be no invasion there be no justification whatsoever for this outrageous and brutal act of aggression a puppet regime impose from the outside be unacceptable the acquisition of territory by force be unacceptable no one friend or foe should doubt desire for peace and no one should underestimate determination to confront aggression simple principle guide policy first seek the immediate unconditional and complete withdrawal of all iraqi force from kuwait second kuwait 's legitimate government must be restore to replace the puppet regime and third administration as have be the case with every president from president roosevelt to president reagan be commit to the security and stability of the|persian|gulf and fourth be determined to protect the life of american citizen abroad immediately after the iraqi invasion order an embargo of all trade with iraq and together with many other nation announce sanction that both freeze all iraqi asset in this country and protect kuwait 's asset the stake be high iraq be already a rich and powerful country that possess the world 's second large reserve of oil and over|a|million man under arm be the fourth large military in the world country now import nearly|half the oil consume and could face a major threat to economic independence much of the world be even more dependent upon import oil and be even more vulnerable to iraqi threat succeed in the struggle for freedom in europe because and ally remain stalwart keep the peace in the|middle|east will require no less be begin a new era this new era can be full of promise an age of freedom a time of peace for all people but if history teach anything be that must resist aggression or will destroy freedom appeasement do not work as be the case in the 's see in an aggressive dictator threaten neighbor only|14|days|ago saddam|hussein promise friend would not invade kuwait and promise the world would withdraw and twice have see what promise mean promise mean nothing in the|last|few|day have speak with political leader from the|middle|east europe asia and the americas and have meet with prime minister thatcher prime minister mulroney and nato secretary general woerner and all agree that iraq can not be allow to benefit from invasion of kuwait agree that this be not an american problem or a european problem or a middle|east problem be the world 's problem and that be why soon after the iraqi invasion the|united|nations|security|council without dissent condemn iraq call for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of troop from kuwait the arab world through both the|arab|league and the|gulf|cooperation|council courageously announce opposition to iraqi aggression japan the|united|kingdom and france and other government around the world have impose severe sanction the|soviet|union and china end all arm sale to iraq and this|past|monday the|united|nations|security|council approve for the first time in mandatory sanction under chapter vii of the|united|nations|charter these sanction now enshrine in international law have the potential to deny iraq the fruit of aggression while sharply limit ability to either import or export anything of value especially oil pledge here today that the|united|state will do part to see that these sanction be effective and to induce iraq to withdraw without delay from kuwait but must recognize that iraq may not stop use force to advance ambition iraq have mass an enormous war machine on the saudi border capable of initiate hostility with little or no additional preparation give the iraqi government 's history of aggression against own citizen as well as neighbor to assume iraq will not attack again would be unwise and unrealistic and therefore after consult with king|fahd send secretary of defense dick|cheney to discuss cooperative measure could take follow those meeting the|saudi|government request help and respond to that request by order u.s. air and ground force to deploy to the|kingdom|of|saudi|arabia let be clear the sovereign independence of saudi|arabia be of vital interest to the|united|state this decision which share with the congressional leadership grow out of the longstanding friendship and security relationship between the|united|state and saudi|arabia u.s. force will work together with those of and other nation to preserve the integrity of saudi|arabia and to deter further iraqi aggression through presence as well as through training and exercise these multinational force will enhance the overall capability of saudi|armed|force to defend the kingdom want to be clear about what be do and why america do not seek conflict nor do seek to chart the destiny of other nation but america will stand by friend the mission of troop be wholly defensive hopefully will not be need long will not initiate hostility but will defend the|kingdom|of|saudi|arabia and other friend in the|persian|gulf be work around the clock to deter iraqi aggression and to enforce u.n. sanction be continue conversation with world leader secretary of defense cheney have just return from valuable consultation with president mubarak of egypt and king|hassan of morocco secretary of state baker have consult with counterpart in many nation include the|soviet|union and today head for europe to consult with president ozal of turkey a staunch friend of the|united|state and will then consult with the|nato|foreign|minister will ask oil produce nation to do what can to increase production in order to minimize any impact that oil flow reduction will have on the world economy and will explore whether and ally should draw down strategic petroleum reserve conservation measure can also help americans everywhere must do part and more thing be ask the oil company to do fair share should show restraint and not abuse today 's uncertainty to raise price stand up for principle will not come easy may take time and possibly cost a great deal but be ask no more of anyone than of the brave young man and woman of armed|force and family and ask that in the church around the country prayer be say for those who be commit to protect and defend america 's interest stand up for principle be an american tradition as have so many time before

see in the berlin airlift and today would like to use this joyous and solemn occasion to speak to and to the rest of the country about relation with the|soviet|union be fit that these remark be make here at texas|a&amp;m|university wise man truman and eisenhower vandenberg and rayburn marshall acheson and kennan — craft the strategy of containment believe that the|soviet|union deny the easy course of expansion would turn inward and address the contradiction of inefficient repressive and inhumane system and be right the|soviet|union be now publicly face this hard reality containment work containment work because democratic principle and institution and value be sound and always have be work because alliance be and be strong and because the superiority of free society and free market over stagnant socialism be undeniable be approach the conclusion of an historic postwar struggle between vision of tyranny and conflict and of democracy and freedom the review of u.s.-soviet relation that administration have just complete outline a new path toward resolve this struggle goal be bold more ambitious than any of predecessor could have think possible review indicate that of perseverance have bring a precious opportunity and now be time to move beyond containment to a new policy for the that recognize the full scope of change take place around the world and in the|soviet|union in sum now have as goal much more than simply contain soviet expansionism seek the integration of the|soviet|union into the community of nation and as the|soviet|union move toward great openness and democratization as meet the challenge of responsible international behavior will match step with step of own ultimately objective be to welcome the|soviet|union back into the world order the|soviet|union say that seek to make peace with the world and criticize own postwar policy these be word that can only applaud but a new relationship can not simply be declare by moscow or bestow by other must be earn must be earn because promise be never enough the|soviet|union have promise a more cooperative relationship before only to reverse course and return to militarism soviet foreign policy have be almost seasonal warmth before cold thaw before freeze seek a friendship that know no season of suspicion no chill of distrust hope be point the|soviet|union to a break with the cycle of the past a definitive break who would have think that would see the deliberation of the|central|committee on the front page of pravda or dissident seat near the council of power who would have imagine a soviet leader who canvass the sidewalk of moscow and also washington d.c. these be hopeful indeed remarkable sign and let no one doubt sincere desire to see this reform continue and succeed but the national security of america and ally be not predicate on hope must be base on deed and look for endure ingrain economic and political change while hope to move beyond containment be only at the beginning of new path many danger and uncertainty be ahead must not forget that the|soviet|union have acquire awesome military capability that be a fact of life for predecessor and that be always be a fact of life for ally and that be a fact of life for today as president of the|united|state as seek peace must also remain strong the purpose of military might be not to pressure a weak soviet economy or to seek military superiority be to deter war be to defend and ally and to do something more to convince the|soviet|union that there can be no reward in pursue expansionism to convince the|soviet|union that reward lie in the pursuit of peace western policy must encourage the evolution of the|soviet|union toward an open society this task will test strength will tax patience and will require a sweeping vision let share with vision see a|western|hemisphere of democratic prosperous nation no longer threaten by a cuba or a nicaragua arm by moscow see a|soviet|union as pull away from tie to terrorist nation like libya that threaten the legitimate security of neighbor see a|soviet|union which respect china 's integrity and return the northern territory to japan a prelude to the|day when all the great nation of asia will live in harmony but the fulfillment of this vision require the|soviet|union to take positive step include first reduce soviet force although some small step have already be take the|warsaw|pact still possess tank more than twice as much artillery and hundreds|of|thousand more troop in europe than nato should cut force to less threatening level in proportion to legitimate security need second adhere to the soviet obligation promise in the|final|days of world|war|ii to support self determination for all the nation of and central europe and this require specific abandonment of the brezhnev doctrine one|day should be possible to drive from moscow to munich without see a single guard tower or a strand of barbed wire in short tear down the iron curtain and third work with the west in positive practical — not merely rhetorical step toward diplomatic solution to these regional dispute around the world welcome the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan and the angola agreement but there be much more to be do around the world be ready let roll up sleeve and get to work and fourth achieve a lasting political pluralism and respect for human right dramatic event have already occur in moscow be impress by limited but freely contest election be impress by a great toleration of dissent be impress by a new frankness about the stalin era mr. gorbachev do not stop now and fifth join with in address press global problem include the international drug menace and danger to the environment can build a well world for child as the|soviet|union move toward arm reduction and reform will find willing partner in the west seek verifiable stabilize arm control and arm reduction agreement with the|soviet|union and ally however arm control be not an end in but a means of contribute to the security of america and the peace of the world direct secretary of state baker to propose to the soviets that resume negotiation on strategic force in june and as know the|soviet|union have agree basic approach be clear in the strategic arm reduction talk wish to reduce the risk of nuclear war and in the companion defense and space talk objective will be to preserve option to deploy advanced defense when be ready in nuclear testing will continue to seek the necessary verification improvement in exist treaty to permit to be bring into force and be go to continue to seek a verifiable global ban on chemical weapon support nato effort to reduce the soviet offensive threat in the negotiation on conventional force in europe and as have say fundamental to all of these objective be simple openness make no mistake a new breeze be blow across the steppe and the city of the|soviet|union why not then let this spirit of openness grow let more barrier come down open emigration open debate open airwave let openness come to mean the publication and sale of ban book and newspaper in the|soviet|union let the soviet jews who emigrate last|year be follow by any number who wish to emigrate this|year and when people apply for exit visa let there be no harassment against let openness come to mean nothing less than the free exchange of people and book and idea between east and west and let come to mean thing more four|years|ago president eisenhower meet in geneva with soviet leader who after the death of stalin promise a new approach toward the west propose a plan call open|sky which would allow unarmed aircraft from the|united|state and the|soviet|union to fly over the territory of the other country this would open up military activity to regular scrutiny and as president eisenhower put convince the world that be lessen danger and relax tension president eisenhower 's suggestion test the soviet readiness to open society and the kremlin fail that test now let again explore that proposal but on a broad more intrusive and radical basis— one which hope would include ally on both side suggest that those country that wish to examine this proposal meet soon to work out the necessary operational detail separately from other arm control negotiation such surveillance flight complement satellite would provide regular scrutiny for both side such unprecedented territorial access would show the world the true meaning of the concept of openness the very soviet willingness to embrace such a concept would reveal commitment to change where there be cooperation there can be a broad economic relationship but economic relation have be stifle by soviet internal policy have be injure by moscow 's practice of use the cloak of commerce to steal technology from the west end discriminatory treatment of u.s. firm would be a helpful step trade and financial transaction should take place on a normal commercial basis and should the soviet|union codify emigration law in accord with international standard and implement new law faithfully be prepared to work with congress for a temporary waiver of the jackson vanik amendment open the way to extend most favor nation trade status to the|soviet|union after that last weighty point can just imagine what be think have to happen last|day in college have to end with yet another political science lecture laughter in all seriousness the policy have just describe have everything to do with today graduate be go to start career and family and will become the leader of america in

all of that time win a nickname the|great|communicator but never think be style or the word use that make a difference be the content be not a great communicator but communicate great thing and do not spring full bloom from brow come from the heart of a great nation from experience wisdom and belief in the principle that have guide for two|centurie call the reagan revolution well will accept that but for always seem more like the great rediscovery a rediscovery of value and common sense common sense tell that when put a big tax on something the people will produce less of so cut the people 's tax rate and the people produce more than ever before the economy bloom like a plant that have be cut back and could now grow quicker and strong economic program bring about the long peacetime expansion in history real family income up the poverty rate down entrepreneurship booming and an explosion in research and new technology be export more than ever because american industry because more competitive and at the same time summon the national will to knock down protectionist wall abroad instead of erect at home common sense also tell that to preserve the peace would have to become strong again after year of weakness and confusion so rebuilt defense and this|new|year toast the new peacefulness around the globe not only have the superpower actually begin to reduce stockpile of nuclear weapon and hope for even more progress be bright but the regional conflict that rack the globe be also begin to cease the|persian|gulf be no longer a war zone the soviets be leave afghanistan the vietnamese be prepare to pull out of cambodia and an american mediate accord will soon send cuban troop home from angola the lesson of all this be of course that because be a great nation challenge seem complex will always be this way but as long as remember first principle and believe in the future will always be ours and something else learn once begin a great movement there be no tell where will end mean to change a nation and instead change a world country across the globe be turn to free market and free speech and turn away from the ideology of the past for the great rediscovery of the|1980s have be that lo and behold the moral way of government be the practical way of government democracy the profoundly good be also the profoundly productive when have get to the point when can celebrate the anniversary of 39th birthday can sit back sometimes review life and see flow before for there be a fork in the river and be right in the middle of life never mean to go into politic be not intention when be young but be raise to believe have to pay way for the blessing bestow on be happy with career in the entertainment world but ultimately go into politic because want to protect something precious be the first revolution in the history of mankind that truly reverse the course of government and with little word the people we|the|people tell the government what to do do not tell the people be the driver the government be the car and decide where should go and by what route and how fast almost all the world 's constitution be document in which government tell the people what privilege be constitution be a document in which we|the|people tell the government what be allow to do the people be free this belief have be the underlying basis for everything have try to do these|past|eight|year but back in the|1960s when begin seem to that would begin reverse the order of thing that through more and more rule and regulation and confiscatory taxis the government be take more of money more of option and more of freedom go into politic in part to put up hand and say stop be a citizen politician and seem the right thing for a citizen to do think have stop a lot of what need stop and hope have once again remind people that man be not free unless government be limit there be a clear cause and effect here that be as neat and predictable as a law of physics as government expand liberty contract nothing be less free than pure communism — and yet have the|past|few|year forge a satisfying new closeness with the|soviet|union have be ask if this be not a gamble and answer be no because be base action not on word but deed the detente of the|1970s be base not on action but promise would promise to treat own people and the people of the world better but the gulag be still the gulag and the state be still expansionist and still wag proxy war in africa asia and well this time so far be different president gorbachev have bring about some internal democratic reform and begin the withdrawal from afghanistan have also free prisoner whose name have give every time have meet but life have a way of remind of big thing through small incident once during of the moscow summit nancy and decide to break off from the|entourage|one|afternoon to visit the shop on arbat street — that be a little street just off moscow 's main shopping area even though visit be a surprise every russian there immediately recognize and call out name and reach for hand be just about sweep away by the warmth could almost feel the possibility in all that joy but within second a kgb detail push way toward and begin push and shove the people in the crowd be an interesting moment remind that while the man on the street in the|soviet|union yearn for peace the government be communist and those who run be communists and that mean and view such issue as freedom and human right very differently must keep up guard but must also continue to work together to lessen and eliminate tension and mistrust view be that president gorbachev be different from previous soviet leader think know some of the thing wrong with society and be try to fix wish well and will continue to work to make sure that the|soviet|union that eventually emerge from this process be a less threatening what all boil down to be this want the new closeness to continue and will as long as make clear that will continue to act in a certain way as long as continue to act in a helpful manner if and when do not at first pull punch if persist pull the plug be still trust but verify be still play but cut the card be still watch closely and do not be afraid to see what see have be ask if have any regret well do the deficit be have be talk a great deal about that lately but tonight be not for argument and be go to hold tongue but an observation have have share of victory in the congress but what few people notice be that never win anything do not win for never see troop never see reagan 's regiment the american people win every battle with every call make and letter write demand action well action be still need if be to finish the job reagan 's regiment will have to become the bush brigade soon will be the chief and will need every bit as much as do finally there be a great tradition of warning in presidential farewell and have get that be be on mind for some time but oddly enough start with of the thing be proud of in the|past|eight|years the resurgence of national pride that call the new patriotism this national feeling be good but will not count for much and will not last unless be ground in thoughtfulness and knowledge an informed patriotism be what want and be do a good enough job teach child what america be and what represent in the long history of the world those of who be over|35|or|so|years|of|age grow up in a different america be teach very directly what mean to be an american and absorb almost in the air a love of country and an appreciation of institution if do not get these thing from family get from the neighborhood from the father down the street who fight in korea or the family who lose someone at anzio or could get a sense of patriotism from school and if all else fail could get a sense of patriotism from the popular culture the movie celebrate democratic value and implicitly reinforce the idea that america be special tv be like that too through the mid-'60 but now be about to enter the 90 and some thing have change young parent be not sure that an unambivalent appreciation of america be the right thing to teach modern child and as for those who create the popular culture well ground patriotism be no longer the style spirit be back but have not reinstitutionalize have get to do a well job of get across that america be freedom freedom of speech freedom of religion freedom of enterprise and freedom be special and rare be fragile need production protection]. so have get to teach history base not on what be in fashion but what be important why the pilgrims come here who jimmy|doolittle be and what those over tokyo mean know four|years|ago on the 40th anniversary of d day read a letter from a young woman write to late father who have fight on omaha|beach name be lisa|zanatta|henn and say will always remember will never forget what the boy of normandy do well let help keep word if forget what do will not know who be be warn of an eradication of the american memory that could result ultimately in an erosion of the american spirit let start with some basic more attention to american history and a great emphasis on civic ritual and let offer lesson number about america all great change in america begin at the dinner table so tomorrow|night in the kitchen hope the talking begin and child if parent have not be teach what mean to be an american let know and nail on that would be a very american thing to do and that be about all have to say tonight except for thing the|past|few|day when have be at that window upstairs have think a bit of the shin city upon a hill the phrase come from john|winthrop who write to describe the america imagine what imagine be important because be an early pilgrim an early freedom man journey here on what today would call a little wooden boat and like the other pilgrims be look for a home that would be free have speak of the shin city all political life but do not know if ever quite communicated what see when say but in mind be a tall proud city build on rock strong than ocean windswept god bless and teem with people of all kind live in harmony and peace a city with free port that hum with commerce and creativity and if there have to be city wall the wall have door and the door be open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here that be how see and see still and how stand the city on this winter night more prosperous more secure and happy than be but more than that after two|centurie still stand strong and true on the granite ridge and glow have hold steady no matter what storm and be still a beacon still a magnet for all who must have freedom for all the pilgrim from all the lose place who be hurtle through the darkness toward home have do part and as walk off into the city street a final word to the man and woman of the reagan revolution the man and woman across america who for eight|year do the work that bring america back friend do be not just mark time make a difference make the city strong make the city freer and leave in good hand all in all not bad not bad at all and so goodbye god bless and god bless the|united|states|of|america & nbsp view transcript transcript well thank very much for that warm welcome governor baliles congressman slaughter and very special thank too to senator warner and president o'neil for suggest this invitation and know as president have certain privilege so check with president o'neil and be delighted to announce that start all have off but here at uva be surround with memory of thomas|jefferson of staff mention that thomas|jefferson 's favorite recreation be horseback rid and say be a wise man laughter and another member of the staff say that thomas|jefferson thought the|white|house be a noble edifice and say be a man of refined taste laughter and a third staff member note that after retire as president thomas|jefferson in his|seventie do not sit back and rest but found and say there be always an overachiever which make hard for the rest of but no speaker can come to these ground or see the lawn without appreciate the symmetry not just of the architecture but of the mind that create the man to whom that mind belong be know to as mr. jefferson and think the familiarity of that term be justified influence here be everywhere and yet while those of at uva be fortunate to have before physical reminder of the power of founder 's intellect and imagination should be remember that all do here indeed all of high education in america bear sign too of transform genius the pursuit of science the study of the great work the value of free inquiry in short the very idea of the live the life of the mind yes these formative and abide principle of high education in america have first and firm advocate and great embodiment in a tall fair head friendly man who watch this university take form from the mountainside where live the university whose found call a crowning achievement to a long and well spend life well be not alone in feel presence president know about this too have hear many time that during the|first|year of presidency john|f.|kennedy say to a group of nobel laureate in the state dining room of the|white|house that there have not be such a collection of talent in that place since jefferson din there alone laughter and directly down the lawn and across the ellipse from the|white|house be those order classic line of and the eye of the 19-foot statue that gaze directly into the|white|house a reminder to any of who may occupy that mansion of the quality of mind and generosity of heart that once abide there and have be so rarely see there again but be not just student and president be every american indeed every human life ever touch by the dare idea of self government that mr. jefferson have influence yes mr. jefferson be oblige to admit all previous attempt at popular government have prove failure but believe that here on this continent as of commentator put here be virgin soil an abundance of land no degrade poverty a brave and intelligent people which have just vindicate title to independence after a long struggle with the mighty of european power well here be another chance an opportunity for enlighten government government base on the principle of reason and tolerance government that leave to the people the fruit of labor and the pursuit of own definition of happiness in the form of commerce or education or religion and so be no wonder ask that epitaph read simply here be bear bury thomas|jefferson author|of|the|declaration of american independence of the statute of virginia for religious freedom and father of well as that epitaph show for all learning and bookishness mr. jefferson be a practical man a man who make thing thing like a university a state government a|national|government in found and sustain these institution want to be base on the same symmetry the same balance of mind and faith in human creativity evidence in the lawn have know personal tragedy know how disorderly a place the world could be indeed as a leader of a rebellion be an architect if will of disorder but also believe that man have receive from god a precious gift of enlightenment the gift of reason a gift that could extract from the chaos of life meaning truth order just as see in architecture the balancing of circular with linear of rotunda with pillar see in work of government the same disposition toward balance toward symmetry and harmony know successful self government mean bring together disparate interest and concern balancing for example on the hand the legitimate duty of government the maintenance of domestic order and protection from foreign menace with government 's tendency to preempt citizen ' right take the fruit of labor and reduce ultimately to servitude so know that govern mean balance harmony and know from personal experience the danger pose to such harmony by the voice of unreason special privilege partisanship or intolerance and do mean personal experience see despite all of george|washington 's warning about the divisiveness of the partisan spirit federalists and republicans be constantly at each other in those|days the federalists of the northeast have hold power for a long time and be not anxious to relinquish years|later a new|york congressman honor the good old|day when as put a federalist could knock a republican down in the street of new|york and not be question about the federalists refer to mr. jefferson as and here quote a mean spirited low live fellow raise wholly on hotcake make of coarse ground southern corn bacon and hominy with an occasional fricasseed bullfrog laughter well by the way be the equivalent of what believe be know here at uva as a|gus|burger laughter and an editorial in the federalist connecticut courant also announce that as soon as mr. jefferson be elect murder robbery rape and adultery and incest will be openly teach and practice laughter well that be politic in so see not all that much have change laughter actually have take a moment for these brief reflection on thomas|jefferson and time precisely because there be such clear parallel to own too have see a new populism in america not at all unlike that of jefferson 's time have see the growth of a jefferson like populism that reject the burden place on the people by excessive regulation and taxation that reject the notion that judgeship should be use to further privately hold belief not yet approve by the people and finally reject too the notion that foreign policy must reflect only the rarefy concern of washington rather than the common sense of a people who can frequently see far more plainly danger to freedom and to national well being be this latter point that bring to the|university|of|virginia today there have be much change in the|last|8|years in foreign relation and this|september when speak to the|united|nation summarize much of the progress have see in such matter as the human right agenda arm reduction and resolve those regional conflict that may lead to wide war will not recite all of this here again today but do want to know find in the delegate afterward a warmth that have not see before let assure not due to any eloquence on part but just a simple perception on part that there be a chance for an opening a new course in human event think detect a sense of excitement even perhaps like that feel by those who live in jefferson 's time a sense of new possibility for the idea of popular government only this time be not just a single nation at issue be the whole world where popular government may flourish and prosper only|a|few|years|ago this would have seem the most outlandish and dreamy of prospect but consider for just a moment the striving for democracy that have see in place like the philippines burma korea chile poland south|africa even place like china and the|soviet|union of the great unnoticed and yet most startling development of this|decade be this more of the world 's populace be today live in relative freedom than ever before in history more and more nation be turn to freely elect democratic government the statistic be compelling accord to organization freedom|house in the|past|15|year the number of country call not free decline from to and the country classify as free or partly free increase from to when consider that accord to the freedom|house count of those not live in freedom be in china and the|soviet|union and even in those nation as say see glimpse of hope the picture be even bright the most dramatic movement of all have take place more|than|90|percent of the people be now live in country that be democratic or head in that direction this democratic revolution have be accompany by a change in economic thinking comparable to the newtonian revolution in physics and that be no accident free market economy have work miracle in several nation of east|asia a u.n.|general|assembly special session on africa have call for more market orient structural reform in that region in europe the tide be against state ownership of property and even in china and the|soviet|union the theoretical underpinning of socialist economic be be reexamine in this atmosphere have continue to emphasize prudent but deepen development of economic tie which be critical to economic health in the conduct of foreign policy in own hemisphere be about to implement an historic free trade agreement between the|united|state and canada that could well serve as a model for the world these democratic and free market revolution be really the same revolution be base on the vital nexus between economic and political freedom and on the jeffersonian idea that freedom be indivisible that government 's attempt to encroach on that freedom whether be through political restriction on the right of assembly speech or publication or economic repression through high taxation and excessive bureaucracy have be the principal institutional barrier to human progress but if this remarkable revolution have not be obvious to many certainly other eye open change have be self evident consider for just a moment the sight have see this|year an american president with soviet counterpart stroll through and talk to passer by about war and peace an american president there in the|lenin|hill of moscow speak to the student of moscow|state|university young people like yourself about the wonder and splendor of human freedom an american president only|last|week with a future american president and the president of the|soviet|union stand in new|york|harbor look up at lady|liberty hear again the prayer on the lip of all those million who once pass that way in hope of a well life and future a prayer of peace and freedom for all humanity and yes even this|week in the devastation of armenia americans and russians make common cause as once make common cause against another terrible enemy but be not the visual and the sound bite that matter behind all of this be a record of diplomatic movement and accomplishment of those visual have see in the|last|year be the signing of accord between mr. gorbachev and and the destruction of american and soviet missile be more than just good television more than just action news the inf treaty be the first accord in history to eliminate an entire class of u.s. and soviet nuclear missile and the start treaty which deal with far large arsenal of long range or what the expert call strategic weapon call for 50-percent reduction in such weapon in geneva where the portion of the draft treaty dispute by side or the other be put in bracket be slowly see those bracket disappear so the treaty be come closer and so too there be progress on nuclear test agreement and chemical weapon and be about to begin new negotiation on the conventional balance in europe mr. gorbachev 's recent announcement at the u.n. about troop reduction be most welcome and appreciate but be important to remember this be a part of and the result of a large disarmament process set in motion another area where the achievement be visible be that of regional conflict in afghanistan have see a settlement lead towards soviet withdrawal in cambodia the first step have be take toward withdrawal of vietnamese troop in brazzaville,&nbsp;just&nbsp;this&nbsp;tuesday,&nbsp;&nbsp;an&nbsp;american mediate accord be sign that will send some|50,000 cuban soldier home from angola the second reversal of cuban military imperialism after rescue of grenada in in the matter of human right have also see extraordinary progress the release of some political prisoner in the|soviet|union initial step toward a reduction of state economic control and more politically representative form of government some great scope to publish and speak critically an increase in emigration and visible step toward great religious freedom and finally in bilateral exchange be see more soviet and american citizen visit each other 's land and a great interchange of scientific cultural and intellectual tradition the summit be indication of the progress have make here look to the|day when the meeting between the leader of the|soviet|union and the|united|state will be regular and frequent and maybe not quite so newsworthy where be strong steadfast succeed in the|persian|gulf the|united|state make clear commitment to defend freedom of navigation and free world interest and this help hasten an end to the|gulf|war and the country stand firm for year insist that the plo have to accept israel 's right to exist sign on to resolutions|242 and and renounce terrorism and now that resolve have pay off now the democratic revolution that talk about earlier and all the change and movement and yes breakthrough that have just cite on the diplomatic front can be directly attribute to the restoration of confidence on the part of democratic nation there can be little doubt that in the|decade of the eighty the cause of freedom and human right have prosper and the specter of nuclear war have be push back because the democracy have recover strength compas here at home a national consensus on the importance of strong american leadership be emerge as say before the congress at the|start|of|this|year no legacy would make more proud than leave in place such a consensus for the cause of world freedom a consensus that prevent a paralysis of american power from ever occur again now think much of the reason for all of this have to do with the new coherence and clarity that have bring to foreign policy a new coherence base on a strong reaffirmation of value by the allied nation the same idea that so energize mr. jefferson and the other founder of this nation the idea of popular government have drive the revival of the west and a renewal of value and belief in but now the question how do keep the world move toward the idea of popular government well today offer thought reflection and warning at the same time on how the soviet american relationship can continue to improve and how the cause of peace and freedom can be serve first the soviet american relationship once mark by sterility and confrontation this relationship be now characterize by dialog realistic candid dialog serious diplomatic progress and the sight and sound of summitry all of this be heady inspire and yet first reflection for today be all of be still in doubt and the only way to make last and grow and become permanent be to remember be not there yet serious problem fundamental difference remain system be of check and balance for all reform remain a party authoritarian system that institutionalize the concentration of power foreign relation embrace this expand world of democracy that have describe can be know by the company keep cuba nicaragua ethiopia libya vietnam north|korea yes welcome mr. gorbachev 's recent announcement of a troop reduction but let remember that the soviet preponderance in military power in europe remain an asymmetry that offend jeffersonian sens and endanger future so must keep head and that mean keep skepticism must realize that what have bring here have not be easy not for nor for all of those who have sacrifice and contribute to the cause of freedom in the postwar era so this mean in treaty negotiation as have say trust but verify be not a linguist but learn to say that much russian and have use in frequent meeting with mr. gorbachev dovorey no provorey mean keep military strong mean remember no treaty be well than a bad treaty mean remember the accord of moscow and washington summit follow many year of stand firm on principle and interest and those of ally and finally need to recall that in the|year of detente tend to forget the great weapon the democracy have in struggle be public candor the truth must never do that again be not an act of belligerence to speak to the fundamental difference between totalitarianism and democracy be a moral imperative do not slow down the pace of negotiation move forward throughout history see evidence that adversary negotiate seriously with democratic nation only when know the democracy harbor no illusion about those adversary a second reflection have on all this concern some recent speculation that what be happen in the|soviet|union be in way inevitable that since the death of stalin the soviet state would have to evolve into a more moderate and status quo power in accordance with some vague theory of convergence think this be wrong be also dangerous because what see in the|soviet|union today be a change of a different order than in the past for example whatever the khrushchev era may or may not have represent in soviet internal politic know how aspiration for great freedom be crush in poland and germany and even more bloodily in hungary also see the construction of the|berlin|wall see cuba become an active client state a client state spread subversion throughout and bring the entire world to the brink of war with the ` missile of october and let assure mr. khrushchev give no speech at the u.n. like that recently give by mr. gorbachev as british u.n. official say about khrushchev appearance there be never quite sure whether be indeed mr. khrushchev 's shoe be use to pound the soviet desk or whether mr. gromyko 's shoe have be borrow or whether there be an extra shoe keep under the soviet podium especially for bang purpose laughter now all of this be hardly encouraging for the growth of freedom and the path to peace know too what happen in the brezhnev era great and great expansionism afghanistan economic decay and overwhelming corruption a great and great burden on the people of the|soviet|union on all the people of the world now this be change how much and how fast will change do not know would like to think that action by this country particularly willingness to make clear expression of firmness and will evidence by plain talk strong defense vibrant alliance and readiness to use american power when american power be need help to prompt the reappraisal that soviet leader have undertake of previous policy even more western resolve demonstrate that the hardline advocate by some within the|soviet|union would be fruitless just as economic success have set a shin example as suggest in if the west maintain strength would see economic need clash with the political order in the|soviet|union this have happen but could not have happen if the west have not maintain indeed strengthen will commitment to world freedom so there be nothing inevitable about all of this human action make the difference mr. gorbachev have take some daring step as have say before this be the first soviet leader not to make world revolution a priority well let credit those step let credit and let remember too that the democracy with strength and resolve and candor have also make a difference and this be the heart of point what happen in the|next|few|year whether all this progress be continue or end this be in large part up to be why now more then ever must not falter american power must be exercise morally of course but must also be exercise and exercise effectively for the cause of peace and freedom in the eighty that power make all the difference the ninety will prove no different and this bring to third point the relationship between the executive and the congress be precisely where congress and the president have work together as in afghanistan and cambodia or resolve difference as in angola the|persian|gulf and many aspect of u.s.-soviet relation precisely there policy have succeed and see progress but where congress and the president have engage each other as adversary as over central|america u.s. policy have falter and common purpose have not be achieve congress on again off again indecisiveness on resist sandinista tyranny and aggression have leave central|america a region of continue danger sometimes congressional action in foreign affair have have the effect of institutionalize that kind of adversarial relationship see in the|war|powers|resolution in the attempt restriction on the president 's power to implement treaty and on trade policy see in the attempt to manage complex issue of foreign policy by the blunt instrument of legislation such as unduly restrictive intelligence oversight limit on arm transfer and earmark of of foreign assistance deny a president the ability to respond flexibly to rapidly change condition even in arm reduction a president 's ability to succeed depend on congressional support for military modernization sometimes attempt be make to weaken hand the founding fathers understand the need for effectiveness coherence consistency and flexibility in the conduct of foreign affair as jefferson say the transaction of business with foreign nation be executive altogether belong then to the head of that department except as to such portion of as be specially submit to the senate exception be to be construe strictly well the president and the vice president be elect by all the people so too be the congress as a collegial body all who be elect to serve in these coordinate department of have unmistakable and undeniable mandate to preserve protect and defend the constitution to this this foremost must always be attentive for a president mean protect office and place in constitutional framework in do that the president be accountable to the people in the most direct way accountable to history and to own conscience the president and congress to be sure share many responsibility but role be not the same congress alone for example have the power of the purse the president be chief executive chief diplomat and commander in chief how these great branch of government perform legitimate role be critically important to the nation 's ability to succeed nowhere more so than in the field of foreign affair need each other and must work together in common cause with all deference but within separate sphere today live in a world in which america no longer enjoy preponderant power but must lead by example and persuasion a world of press new challenge to economic prosperity a world of new opportunity for peace and of new danger in such a world more than ever america need strong and consistent leadership and the strength and resilience of the presidency be vital think if can keep these concern in mind during public debate and support will be enhance and america 's foreign policy will continue to prosper all of know the terrible importance of maintain the progress have make in the|decade of the eighty be move away from war and confrontation toward peace and freedom and today toward a future beyond the imagining of the past these be the stake some may find such prospect daunt think should find challenging and exciting and think can see that in all of this and country will have a special role to play the issue before the world be still the same as the one that jefferson face so squarely and so memorably can human being manage own affair be self determination and popular representative government possible mr. jefferson 's work and life amount to a great mighty assent to that question so too will and america 's if can keep in mind the great and last lesson of jefferson 's life and have something to do with what just speak to about the executive and congress be fond of recollect that in the|last|years of life john|adam and thomas|jefferson who have work so hard and well together for the nation 's independence both come to regret that have let partisan difference come between for year estrangement last but then when both retire jefferson at to monticello and adams at to quincy begin through letter to speak again to each other letter that discuss almost every conceivable subject gardening horseback rid even sneeze as a cure for hiccup laughter but other subject as well the loss of love one the mystery of grief and sorrow the importance of religion and of course the last thought the final hope of old man great patriarch for the country that have help to find and love so deeply carry back jefferson write about correspondence with cosigner of the|declaration|of|independence to the time when beset with difficulty and danger be fellow laborer in the same cause struggle for what be most valuable to man right to self government labor always at the same oar with some wave ever ahead threaten to overwhelm and yet pass harmless row through the storm with heart and hand be last gift to this lesson in tolerance for each other in charity this insight into america 's strength as a nation and when both die on the|same|day within hour of each other the date be july|4th exactly after that first gift to a great future be ours and the world 's if but remember the power of those word mr. jefferson pen not just for americans but for all humanity that all man be create equal that be endow by creator with certain inalienable rights that among these be life,|liberty and the pursuit of happiness thank and god bless democracy in the|soviet|union q. mr. president and think can speak for everybody really do thank for come to uva but question be consider that lenin claim that the soviets should let capitalist country fund the building of communism would like to know what be position on grant most favor nation status to the|soviet|union and do think if do grant this status that will help promote democracy in the|soviet|union the president well want to help promote this democracy in the|soviet|union but believe that have get to proceed by watch whether deed match the word now in some instance certainly have permit for example to speak to the student at the|university|of|moscow find out afterward however that could not get all the student body in only|a|few|hundre so decide that the few would be those who be member of the|young|communist|league laughter but i&nbsp;think that there be difference between and with this man when have the first summit at geneva and will try not to make answer this long again people more experienced in this who would be on team tell that if could get just the agreement to a second summit that the summit would be worthwhile well have an idea of own in the first meeting and as sit on side of the table and team on look across the table at the general secretary know do not know which to call be get title now general secretary president and chairman laughter then be the general secretary and suggest that why do not leave team here to start talk the subject that be raise be disarmament and why do not and go out and get some air well jump up before even finish speak and out go and be plan there be a fire in the fireplace be very cold that|day down in a little house along the lake from below where be so walk down and for an|hour|and|a|half and have a meeting and a discussion and then decide would better get back up to the regular meeting laughter and be just outside the building and say something to about that have never see russia and turn to and say and have never see the|united|state have never be in the|united|state before say be have the summit here why do not have the next summit in the|united|state and

central|america nation such as el|salvador once threaten by the anarchy of the death squad and the specter of totalitarian rule now know the hope of self government and the prospect of economic growth and another change mr. secretary general a change that if endure may go down as of the signal accomplishment of history a change that be a cause for shake of the head in wonder be also upon a change go to the source of postwar tension and to the once seemingly impossible dream of end the twin threat of time totalitarianism and thermonuclear world war for the first time the difference between east and west — fundamental difference over important moral question deal with the worth of the individual and whether government shall control people or people control government for the first time these difference have show sign of ease ease to the point where there be not just troop withdrawal from place like afghanistan but also talk in the east of reform and great freedom of press of assembly and of religion yes fundamental difference remain but should talk of reform become more than that should become reality there be the prospect of not only a new era in soviet american relation but a new age of world peace for such reform can bring peace history teach and country have always believe that where the right of the individual and the people be enshrine war be a distant prospect for be not people who make war only government do that stand at this podium then in a moment of hope hope not just for the people of the|united|state or the|soviet|union but for all the people of the world and hope too for the dream of peace among nation the dream that begin the|united|nation precisely because of these change today the|united|nation have the opportunity to live and breathe and work as never before already mr. secretary general through persistence patience and unyielding will have show in work toward peace in afghanistan and the|persian|gulf how valuable the|united|nation can be and salute for these accomplishment in geneva at this|very|hour there be numerous negotiation underway multilateral negotiation at the|conference|on|disarmament as well as bilateral negotiation on a range of issue between the soviets and and these negotiation some of under u.n. auspex involve a broad arm control agenda — strategic offensive weapon and space nuclear testing and chemical warfare whose urgency have witness anew in recent|day and mr. secretary general the negotiator be busy and over the|last|few|year have be engage in more than an academic exercise there be movement the logjam be break only recently when the|united|state and the|soviet|union sign the inf agreement an entire class of u.s. and soviet nuclear missile be eliminate for the first time in history progress continue on negotiation to reduce in massive number strategic weapon with effective verification and talk will begin soon on conventional reduction in europe much of the reason for all of this go back believe to geneva to the small chateau along the lake where and the general secretary of the|soviet|union have the first of several fireside chat exchange characterize by frankness but friendliness too say at the first meeting in geneva that this be a unique encounter between people who have the power to start world war iii or to begin a new age of peace among nation and also say peace conference arm negotiation proposal for treaty could make sense only if be part of a wide context a context that seek to explore and resolve the deep underlie difference between say to mr. gorbachev then as have say to before nation do not mistrust each other because be armed be armed because mistrust each other and in that place by that peaceful lake in neutral switzerland mr. gorbachev and do begin a new relationship base not just on engagement over the single issue of arm control but on a broad agenda about deep difference an agenda of human right regional conflict and bilateral exchange between people even on the arm control issue agree to go beyond the past to seek not just treaty that permit build weapon to high level but revolutionary agreement that actually reduce and even eliminate a whole class of nuclear weapon what be begin that morning in geneva have show result in the inf treaty in recent visit to moscow in opportunity to meet there with soviet citizen and dissident and speak of human right and to speak too in the|lenin|hill of moscow to the young people of the|soviet|union about the wonder and splendor of human freedom the result of that|morning in geneva be see in peace conference now underway around the world on regional conflict and in the work of the u.n. here in new|york as well as in geneva but mr. secretary general history teach caution indeed that very building in geneva where important negotiation have take place the|geneva|accord on afghanistan the iran iraq negotiation for example — see today as stonelike testimony to a fail dream of peace in another time the|palais|des|nation be the headquarters of the|league|of|nations an institution that be to symbolize an end to all war and yet today that institution and noble purpose end with the|second|world|war end because the chance for peace be not seize in the 's by the nation of the world end because humanity do not find the courage to isolate the aggressor to reject scheme of government that serve the state not the people be here today mr. secretary general determine that no such fate shall befall the|united|nation be determined that the u.n. should succeed and serve the cause of peace for humankind so mr. secretary general realize that even in this time of hope the chance of failure be real but this knowledge do not discourage spur on for the stake be high do falter and fail now and bring down upon the just anger of future generation or do continue the work of the founder of this institution and see to that at last freedom be enshrine and humanity know war no longer and that this place this floor shall be truly the world 's last battlefield be determine shall be so so turn now to the agenda of peace let begin by address a concern that be much on mind when meet with mr. gorbachev in the kremlin as well as on the mind of soviet citizen that meet in moscow be also an issue that know be of immediate importance to the delegate of this assembly who this fall commemorate the 40th anniversary of the|universal|declaration|of|human|right that declaration say plainly what those who seek peace can forget only at the great peril that peace rest on foundation observe the inalienable right of all member of the human family in a|century where human right have be deny by totalitarian government on a scale never before see in history with so|many|million deliberately starve or eliminate as a matter of state policy a history have be say of blood stupidity and barbed wire few can wonder why peace have prove so elusive now let understand if would have peace must acknowledge the elementary right of fellow human being in own land and in other land if would have peace the trampling of the human spirit must cease human right be not for some some of the time human right as the universal declaration of this assembly adopt in proclaim be for all people and all nation and for all time this regard for human right as the foundation of peace be at the heart of the u.n. those who starve in ethiopia those who die among the kurds those who face racial injustice in south|africa those who still can not write or speak freely in the|soviet|union those who can not worship in the ukraine those who struggle for life and freedom on boat in the|south|china|sea those who can not publish or assemble in managua — all of this be more than just an agenda item on calendar must be a first concern an issue above other for when human right concern be not paramount at the|united|nation when the|universal|declaration|of|human|right be not honor in these hall and meeting room then the very credibility of this organization be at stake the very purpose of existence in question that be why when human right progress be make the united|nation grow strong and the|united|state be glad of follow a effort lead by the|united|state for example the|u.n.|human|rights|commission take a major step toward end the double standard and cynicism that have characterize too much of past for year cuba a blatant violator of citizen ' human right have escape u.n. censure or even scrutiny this|year cuba have respond to pressure generate by the|human|rights|commission by accept an investigation into human right abuse fidel|castro have already begin to free some political prisoner improve prison condition and tolerate the existence of a small independent national human right group more must be do the|united|nation must be relentless and unyielde in seek change in cuba and elsewhere and must also see to that the universal declaration should not be debase with episode like the zionism be racism resolution respect for human right be the first and fundamental mission of this body the most elementary obligation of member indeed wherever turn in the world today there be new awareness a grow passion for human right the people of the world grow unite new group new coalition form coalition that monitor government that work against discrimination that fight religious or political repression unlawful imprisonment torture or execution as those speak to at spaso|house say to such movement make a difference turn now to regional conflict feel again the uplift of hope in the|gulf|war between iran and iraq of the bloody conflict since world|war|ii have a cease fire the resolution and the firmness of the allied nation in keep the|persian|gulf open to international shipping not only uphold the rule of law help prevent further spread of the conflict and lay the basis for peace so too the|security|council 's decisive resolution in july a|year|ago have become the blueprint for a peaceful gulf let this war a war in which there have be no victor or vanquish only victim let this war end now let both iran and iraq cooperate with the secretary general and the|security|council in implement resolution|598 let peace come move on to a second region when first address the|u.n.|general|assembly in world attention be focus on the brutal invasion and illegal occupation of afghanistan after nearly|9|long|year of war the courage and determination of the afghan people and the afghan freedom fighter have hold sway and today an end to the occupation be in sight on april|14 the u.s.s.r. sign the|geneva|accord which be negotiate under u.n. auspex by pakistan and the kabul regime encourage the|soviet|union to complete troop withdrawal at the early possible date so that the afghan people can freely determine future without further outside interference in southern africa too year of patient diplomacy and support for those in angola who seek self determination be have effect look forward to an accord between the government of angola cuba and south|africa that will bring about a complete withdrawal of all foreign troop primarily cuban from angola look forward as well to full implementation of u.n.|security|council resolution and longstanding goal of independence for namibia continue to support a grow consensus among african leader who also believe there can be no end to conflict in the region until there be national reconciliation within angola mr. secretary general there be new hope for cambodia a nation whose freedom and independence seek just as avidly as seek the freedom and independence of afghanistan urge the rapid removal of all vietnamese troop and a settlement that will prevent the return of the|khmer|rouge to power permit instead the establishment of a genuinely representative government a government that will at last respect fully the right of the people of cambodia and end the hideous suffering have so bravely and needlessly bear in other critical area applaud the secretary general 's effort to structure a referendum on the western sahara and in the mediterranean direct talk between greek and turkish cypriot community hold much promise for accord in that divide island nation and finally look to a peaceful solution to the arab israeli conflict so too the unnatural division of europe remain a critical obstacle to soviet american relation in most of these area then see progress and again be glad of only|a|few|years|ago all of these and other conflict be burn dangerously out of control indeed the invasion of afghanistan and the apparent will among democratic and peace love nation to deter such event seem to cause a climate where aggression by nation large and small be epidemic a climate the world have not see since the 's only this time large war be avoid avoid because the free and peaceful nation of the world recover strength of purpose and will and now the|united|nation be provide valuable assistance in help this epidemic to recede and because be resolve to keep so would be remiss in duty if do not now take note here of the exception to progress in regional conflict refer here to the continue deterioration of human right in nicaragua and the refusal of the tiny elite now rule that nation to honor promise of democracy make to own people and to the international community this elite in call revolutionary seek no real revolution the use of the term be subterfuge deception for hide the old most corrupt vice of all man 's age old will to power lust to control the life and steal the freedom of other and that be why as president will continue to urge the congress and the american public to stand behind those who resist this attempt to impose a totalitarian regime on the people of nicaragua that the|united|states will continue to stand with those who be threaten by this regime 's aggression against neighbor in today also call on the|soviet|union to show in central|america the same spirit of constructive realism have show in other regional conflict to assist in bring conflict in to a close by halt the flow of billions|of|dollars worth of arm and ammunition to the sandinista regime a regime whose goal of regional domination while ultimately doom can continue to cause great suffering to the people of that area and risk to soviet american relation unless action be take now move now to the arm reduction agenda have mention already the importance of the inf treaty and the momentum develop in the start negotiation the draft start treaty be a lengthy document fill with bracketed language designate section of disagreement between the side but through this|summer in geneva those bracket have diminish there be every reason to believe this process can continue can tell this assembly that be highly doubtful such a treaty can be accomplish in a|few|month but can tell a year from now be a possibility more than a possibility but have no deadline no agreement be well than a bad agreement the|united|states remain hopeful and acknowledge the spirit of cooperation show by the|soviet|union in these negotiation also look for that spirit to be apply to concern about compliance with exist agreement so too discussion on nuclear testing and defense and space have be useful but let here stress to this|general|assembly that much of the momentum in nuclear arm control negotiation be due to technological progress especially in the potential for space base defensive system believe that determination to research and develop and when ready deploy such defensive system — system target to destroy missile not people — account for a large share of the progress make in recent|years in geneva with such system for the first time in case of accidental launch or the act of a madman somewhere major power will not be face with the single option of massive retaliation but will instead have the chance of a sane choice to shield against an attack instead of avenge so too as defensive system grow in effectiveness reduce the threat and the value of great and great offensive arsenal only recently briefing have receive in the oval|office indicate that progress toward such system may be even more rapid and less costly than have at first thought today the united|states reaffirm commitment to strategic defense initiative and offer to share the benefit of strategic defense with other and yet even as diplomatic and technological progress hold out the hope of at last diminish the awful cloud of nuclear terror have live under in the postwar era even at this moment another ominous terror be loose once again in the world a terror think the world have put behind a terror that loom at now from the long bury past from ghostly scar trench and the haunting wan face of million dead in of the most inhumane conflict of all time poison gas chemical warfare mr. secretary general distinguished delegate the terror of the horror of condemn the use of chemical weapon in the iran iraq war beyond tragic human toll jeopardize the moral and legal stricture that have hold those weapon in check since world|war|i. let this tragedy spark reaffirmation of the geneva protocol outlaw the use of chemical weapon call upon the signatory to that protocol as well as other concerned state to convene a conference to consider action that can take together to reverse the serious erosion of this treaty and urge all nation to cooperate in negotiate a verifiable truly global ban on chemical weapon at the|conference|on|disarmament in geneva be incumbent upon all civilized nation to ban once and for all and on a verifiable and global basis the use of chemical and gas warfare finally mr. secretary general must redouble effort to stop further proliferation of nuclear weapon in the world likewise proliferation in other high technology weapon such as ballistic missile be reach global proportion exacerbate regional rivalry in way that can have global implication the number of potential supplier be grow at an alarming rate and more must be do to halt the spread of these weapon this be a matter of discussion last|week between secretary shultz and foreign minister shevardnadze talk between american and soviet expert begin on this today and hope to see a multilateral effort to avoid have area of tension like the|middle|east become even more deadly battleground than already be but in most of these area see not only progress but also the potential for an increasingly vital role for multilateral effort and institution like this|united|nations that be why now more than ever the|united|nation must continue to increase effectiveness through budget and program reform the u.n. already be enact sweeping measure affect personnel reduction budget by consensus and the establishment of program priority these action be extremely important the progress on reform have allow to release fund withhold under congressional restriction expect the reform program will continue and that further fund will be release in our|new|fiscal|year and let say here congratulate the|united|nation on the work have do in area of special concern first struggle against the scourge of terrorism and state sponsor terrorism must continue and must also end the scourge of hostage taking second the work of the|world|health|organization in coordinate and advance research on aids be vital all international effort in this area must be redouble the aids crisis be a grave one must move as to meet and so too be the drug crisis be move now toward a new anti - drug traffic convention this important treaty will be complete in december be confident other strong u.n. drug control program will also follow the american people be profoundly concerned and deeply angered will not tolerate the drug trafficker mean to make war on and believe this be war the|united|nation can endorse and participate in yes the|united|nation be a well place than be and so too be the world but the real issue of reform in the|united|nation be not limit just to fiscal and administrative improvement but also to a high sort of reform an intellectual and philosophical reform a reform of old view about the relationship between the individual and the state few development for example have be more encouraging to the|united|states than the special session this body hold on africa a session in which the|united|nation join as in a call for free market incentive and a lessening of state control to spur economic development at of the first international assembly of presidency in cancun mexico say history demonstrate that time and again in place after place economic growth and human progress make great stride in country that encourage economic freedom that individual farmer laborer owner trader and manager be the heart and soul of development trust because where be allow to create and build where be give a personal stake in decide economic policy and benefit from success then society become more dynamic prosperous progressive and free believe in freedom know work and this mr. secretary general and distinguished delegate be the immutable lesson of the postwar era that freedom work even more that freedom and peace work together that pass everywhere in the world this lesson be take hold from the|people's|republic|of|china to cameroon from bolivia to botswana and yes in the citadel of marxism leninism no country do not invent this synergy of peace and freedom but believe impose no restriction on the free export of more than century of experience with free people bless by economic opportunity and protect by law that respect the dignity of the individual be not drive toward war or the domination of other here then be the way to world peace and yet americans champion freedom not only because be practical and beneficial but because be also just morally right and here mr. secretary general hope will permit to note that have address this assemblage more than any of predecessor and that this will be the last occasion do so so hope too may be permit now some closing reflection the world be currently witness another celebration of international cooperation at the olympics see nation join together in the competition of sport and see young people who know precious little of the resentment of elder come together as of young athlete from a home of modest mean say that draw the strength for achievement from another source of wealth be rich as a family say about the love be give and the value be teach mr. secretary general dare to hope that in the sentiment of that young athlete see a sign of the rediscovery of old and tested value value such as family the first and most important unit of society where all value and learning begin an institution to be cherish and protect value too such as work community freedom and faith for be here find the deep rationale for the cause of human right and world peace and own experience on this continent the american experience though brief have have unmistakable encounter an insistence on the preservation of sacred truth be a truth that first president founding father pass on in the first farewell address make to the american people be a truth that hope now will permit to mention in these remark of farewell a truth embody in declaration of independence that the case for inalienable right that the idea of human dignity that the notion of conscience above compulsion can be make only in the context of high law only in the context of what of the founder of this organization secretary general dag|hammarskjold have call devotion to something which be great and high than be this be the endless cycle the final truth to which humankind seem always to return that religion and morality that faith in something high be prerequisite for freedom and that justice and peace within be the first step toward justice and peace in the world and for the age yes this be a place of great debate and grave discussion and yet can not help but note here that of founding|father the most worldly of man an internationalist benjamin|franklin interrupt the proceeding of own constitutional|convention to make much the same point and can not help but think this|morning of other beginning of where and when first read those word and shall beat sword into plowshare and young man shall see vision and old man shall dream dream this|morning thought go to who give many thing in life but most important gift be the knowledge of happiness and solace to be gain in prayer be the great help have have in presidency and recall here lincoln 's word when say only the most foolish of man would think could confront the duty of the office now hold without turn to someone strong a power above all other think then of and other like in that small town in illinois gentle people who possess something that those who hold position of power sometimes forget to prize no one of could ever have imagine the boy from the bank of the|rock|river would come to this moment and have this opportunity but have be tell would happen think would have be a bit disappointed if would not speak here for what know so well that when grow weary of the world and trouble when faith in humanity falter be then that must seek comfort and refreshment of spirit in a deep source of wisdom great than and so if future generation do say of that in time peace come closer that do bring about new season of truth and justice will be cause for pride but shall be a cause of great pride still if be also say that be wise enough to know the deliberation of great leader and great body be but overture that the truly majestic music the music of freedom of justice and peace be the music make in forget self

funnel aid to the contra through convict drug dealer value begin at the top in the|white|house those be the value want to bring to the presidency and to the|white|house begin in january|of|1989 lehrer governor a follow up question have two|minute to answer be suggest sir that president reagan be of the cause of the drug problem in this country dukakis be say that those of who be elect to position of political leadership jim have a special responsibility not only to come up with program and have outline in detail the very important very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education prevention and mr. bush be right the go hand in hand but if government be do business with people who know be engage in drug profiteering and drug trafficking if do not understand that that send out a very very bad message to young people be a little difficult for to understand just how can reach out to that youngster that talk about and to young people like all over the country and say to want to help now have outline in great detail a program for be tough on enforcement at home and abroad double the number of drug enforcement agent have a hemispheric summit soon after the|20th|of|january when bring democratic neighbor and ally together here in this hemisphere and go to work together but also have to take demand seriously know have of the world 's population in this country be consume of the world 's cocaine and in state be proud to say have organize a drug education and prevention program which the|federal|drug|enforcement|administration say be a model for the country be help youngster be reach out to and be begin with drug education and prevention beginning in the early elementary grade in every elementary school in state and that be the kind of effort need in every elementary school in the|united|states|of|america and have get to begin early in the first second and third grade before youngster begin to experiment with these very very dangerous substance guess the question would ask of mr. bush be how instill those value how create this environment for the drug free school that want in this country if or representative of the administration be either with or involve people like noriega in foreign policy or do not pursue that connection in a way that make possible for to cut off and to be an example to kid all over the country lehrer a|minute to rebut mr. vice president bush well the other day opponent be give a briefing by the cia ask for and receive the same briefing be very careful in public life about deal with classified information and what be about to say be unclassified administration be deal with mr. noriega be the reagan bush administration that bring this man to justice and as the governor of massachusetts know there be no evidence that governor that mr. noriega be involve in drug no hard evidence until indict and so think be about time get this noriega matter in perspective panama be a friendly country go down there and talk to the president of panama about clean up money laundering and mr. noriega be there but there be no evidence at that time and when the evidence be there indict and want to bring to justice and so call off all those picket out there that be try to tear down different administration lehrer all right the next question will be ask by john|mashek go to governor dukakis and will have two|minute to answer mashek governor dukakis another troublesome issue for voter this|year be the bulge federal deficit in a dukakis administration say taxis will be raise only as a last resort would identify for then please specific program that be willing to cut to bring that deficit down dukakis yes have be very specific about those john and let lay out for own strategy for bring that deficit down because as a chief executive that be balanced budget in a row have have to make those tough decision and those tough choice first have suggest that there be certain weapon system which do not need and can not afford mr. bush have be critical of for that but think those be the kind of tough choice have to make have also suggest that there be weapon system that should proceed on and have outline those in detail secondly have get to invest in economic growth in this country in every part of this country build that kind of growth expand revenue and help to bring down that deficit thirdly have to bring interest rate down and will as come up with a good solid plan with the congress for bring that deficit down and finally have get to go out there and collect billions|and|billions|of|dollar in taxis owe that be not be pay to this country be very unfair to the average taxpayer who pay taxis and pay on time to permit these monie to go uncollected have also suggest that on the domestic side there be area where can make some cut ought to be able to come up with an agricultural policy in this country that give farm family a fair price and a decent future without spend a year which be what have be do under this administration can help people to live well life and at the same time save money by help hundreds|of|thousands of family on welfare to get off or welfare and to become productive citizen again the thing do not understand about mr. bush 's approach to this be how could possibly be serious about bring that deficit down give what say want to do seem to want to spend a great deal of money on just about every weapon system say be against new taxis although be break that pledge at least time in the|last|year that know of want to give the wealthy taxpayer in this country a year tax break also want to spend a lot of money on additional program if keep this up be go to be of american politic dukakis but hope will not take five|second away from will say this lehrer two|minute be up governor dukakis if be serious about what be say then the only place can go to balance that budget be to raid and try that in and think be go to try again lehrer have a minute to rebut bush be this the time to unleash liner that answer be about as clear as boston harbor let help the governor there be so many thing there do not quite know where to begin when cut capital gain put people to work john|kennedy propose cut capital gain paul|tsonga a liberal senator from massachusetts say the dumb thing do be to oppose the capital gain cut be not go to cost the government money be go to increase revenue to the federal government and be go to create job so that be of the thing that think make a big difference between massachusetts do not have an enormous defense budget but nevertheless the governor raise taxis different time that happen to be a fact and so let kind of stay on the issue and have make a specific proposal for what call a flexible freeze and permit economist on the|east|coast and west think be good permit the president to sort out the priority and continue to grow because will not raise taxis lehrer time be up too a follow up john mashek mr. vice president have vow not to raise taxis of any kind during administration and at the same time have propose this capital gain cut have propose more incentive break for the oil industry have suggest new spending program and even some republican say the flexible freeze just speak about will hardly make a dent in the deficit be the deficit no longer really a concern of your or the taxpayer bush think be and concern to bring down and presidential leadership that want to provide in this area will bring down but have get to get the democrats congress under control do all the spending appropriate every dime and tell how to spend every dime would like to ask the governor to join in get for the president what governor have the line item veto have to operate in massachusetts under a balanced budget proviso would like a balanced budget amendment but the dynamic of the economy cut the taxis and revenue be up by in three|years so the problem be be not that the working be be tax too little or the person work out the woman work in some factory be tax too little be that be continue to spend too much so formula say grow at the rate of inflation permit the president to set the priority on where do the spending and remember the federal deficit have come down in one|year in and if and the – actually this|year congress be do a little well in control the growth of spending spending be only up something like so be not that be take too little from taxpayer be spend too much still and the formula have give work have put through a good economic model have get good economist on the|west|coast michael|boskin and marty|feldstein up there who be a very respected economist in the – massachusetts and agree that if can do what have say can get down without go and sock the american taxpayer once again capital gain more point on that please let learn from history a capital gain differential will increase job increase risk taking increase revenue to the federal government lehrer governor have a minute to rebut dukakis well hope all of those americans out there who be watch listen to and try to make up mind about which of ought to be president of the|united|state listen to the vice president very carefully what be propose after over a in new debt which have be add in the federal debt in the course of the|past|eight|years an iou child and grandchild will be pay for year be a tax cut for the wealthy of the people in this country an average of about|$30,000 that be go to give to people make a year why that be more than the average teacher make have have enough of that lady and gentleman have run up more debt in the|last|eight|years than under all the presidents from george|washington to jimmy|carter combine be time for a chief executive who can make tough choice can work with the congress can get that deficit down and begin to build a strong fiscal foundation under this country lehrer all right the next question will be ask by anne|groer and will go the vice president have two|minute to answer sir groer mr. vice president have say want a kind gentle presidency that help the less fortunate today americans include many work family with age parent and young child can not afford any health insurance but earn too much to qualify for medicaid what will do to provide protection for and how will pay for bush thing will not do be sock every business in the country and thus throw some people out of work want to keep this economic recovery go more americans at work today than any time in history a great percentage of the work force what will do be permit people to buy into medicaid believe that be the answer be proud to have be part of an administration that past the first catastrophic health bill and in that there be some medicaid provision that will be very helpful to the very kind of people be talk about here but have get to keep go forward without kill off the engine and throw people out of work so the answer lie seem to in full enforcement of the catastrophic program lie to in flexibility in medicaid so people at the low end can buy in there and get need cover and then also do not want to see mandate across the board that every company have to do this because really think that marginal operator be go to go say can not make and think then be go to see that people be put out of work all these program and this cost on – be be see an estimate would love to know what think and seem to that somebody pay that there be not any such thing as something free out there either get pass along as increase price or get pass along by people be put out of work so the business can continue to compete so think ought to do in the medicaid system think ought to do by full enforcement of the catastrophic health insurance think ought to do by everybody do what can do out of conscience be a terrible problem in term of flexibility on private insurance but just do not want to mandate and risk put this set the recovery back lehrer a rebuttal governor dukakis but george that be no answer bush do not like the answer but be an answer dukakis well no be no answer to those people most of member of work family who do not have a dime of health insurance and do not know how to pay the bill if kid get sick at night be in houston on tuesday meeting with a group of good citizen work citizen all of with little or no health insurance of be a father who have be lay off a|few|months|ago and lose health insurance have an 11-year old son and can not let that son compete in sport and little|league because be afraid be go to get hurt and will not be able to provide health insurance to pay those bill state just become the only state in the nation to provide for universal health care and do with the support of the business community and labor and the health care community and with virtually everybody in the state the fact of the matter be that employer who today be insure employee be pay the freight because be pay for those who be not and think be time that when get a job in this country come with health insurance that be the way be go to provide basic health security for all of the citizen of this country of lehrer follow up anne groer yes since massachusetts health plan have be attack by the vice president and have defend in this way would like to move on to perhaps of the most costly medical catastrophe face americans today and that be aids in at the|end|of|september the thousand of aids patient will lose access to azt which be the only federally approve drug for treatment of the disease now would like to now sir if what position be on extend that and what be think the government ought to be do about make azt and other drug available to people who be suffer from this disease dukakis well anne let just say before answer question that do not know that the vice president attack program in massachusetts hope have not because have win the support of a great many people all over the state and think be a model for what hope can do across the country but when propose plan this|past|tuesday or of spokesman call socialize medicine the last time the vice president use that phrase suspect remember do not be in and that be what call medicare well be wrong then and be wrong now lehrer if may interrupt at this point and caution the audience as do before go on the air please hold down be only take time away from candidate when do that governor continue please dukakis let say this about aids be the single most important public health crisis single most important public health emergency have have in lifetime and think there be a number of thing have to do include support legislation which be now move through the congress which will commit this nation to the resource to find a cure which will provide broad education and prevention which will provide sensitive and caring treatment for the victim of aids think have to demonstrate some flexibility and think the fda be attempt to do so now in try to make possible for new and experimental drug to be available to people who be at risk at aids and would hope that could bring that kind of a policy to bear beginning in january and would encourage the current administration to proceed with that kind of flexibility where be appropriate and where be do carefully and responsibly but have not have the kind of leadership should have have in this particular area think the vice president and be in general agreement on what have to do the special federal commission make good solid recommendation think be both supportive of and would strongly lead in that area as have in state as governor lehrer mr. vice president a minute of rebuttal bush well be on the right track the nih be do a good job in research the|surgeon|general be do a good job in encourage the proper kind of education notice that the governor do not mention any testing but get to have a knowledge base testing should be confidential but have to have a knowledge can not simply stick head in the sand in term of testing be chairman of the president 's task|force|on|regulatory|relief and be work with the fda and have speed up bring drug to market that can help and get to be careful here because there be a safety factor but think these thing and then also be who believe have get to go the extra mile in clean be sure that that blood supply be pure can not have a lack of confidence in the blood supply when come to operation and surgery and thing of this nature so research speed the drug to market testing blood supply be very important element of this lehrer next question will be ask by peter|jenning go to the governor jennings good evening mr. vice president governor governor theme that keep come up about the way govern have both mention leadership tonight so would like to stay with that for a second the theme that keep come up about the way govern be passionless technocratic dukakis passionless jennings passionless technocratic the smart clerk in the world critic maintain that in the|1960s public passion be not the war in vietnam or civil right but no fault auto insurance and say in the|1970s play virtually no role in the painful busing crisis in boston give the fact that a president must sometimes lead by sheer inspiration and passion need to know if this be a fair portrait of governing or if be a stereotype and if be not fair give an example of where have have that passion and leadership that sometimes a president need dukakis peter care deeply about people all people work people work family people all over this country who in some case be live from paycheck to paycheck in other case be have a hard time open up the door of college opportunity to child in other case do not have basic health insurance which for most of accept as a matter of course and assume be go to have in order to pay the bill that incur when get sick be somebody who believe deeply in genuine opportunity for every single citizen in this country and that be the kind of passion bring to state be a leader in the civil right movement in state and in legislature care very deeply about that war in vietnam think be a mistake think be wrong and be of the few legislator early in that war that take a stand against the war think be the right stand at the time and think history have prove to be correct but have learn over time serve term be defeat as know and defeat sometimes be an important lesson think be a much well governor today think be a much well person a much well listen think will be a much well president for have go through that experience but the thing that have do in state to bring opportunity to people on public assistance over|50,000 family on welfare that have help to move from welfare to work and to become productive citizen the universal health care bill that just talk about which will guarantee health care for all of citizen the opening up of opportunity to minority in state affirmative action minority contracting the fact that have a unemployment rate and more job than people to fill which give a tremendous opportunity to reach out to everybody and make a part of this wonderful nation of with the opportunity that create these be thing that believe in very very deeply may be a little calm than some about may be a great consensus builder these|day than use to be and think that be a good thing but be run for the presidency of the|united|state have be in public service for because believe deeply in american goal and value and the people of this country and that be the kind of president want to be lehrer mr. vice president a rebuttal bush well do not question passion question and do not question concern about the war in vietnam introduce or support legislation back then that suggest that kid of massachusetts should be exempt from go overseas in that war now that be a certain passion that in view be misguided passion have a big difference on issue see last|year in the primary express passion say be a strong liberal democrat –|august then say be a card carry member of the aclu that be what say be out there on out of the mainstream be very passionate argument with the governor be do want this country to go that far leave and wish have time to let explain but salute for passion just have a big difference on where this country should be lead and in what direction ought to go lehrer peter a question question for the vice president peter jennings would actually like to follow up if may on this mention have make of card carry membership in the|american|civil|liberties|union have use the phrase card carrying so many time since governor dukakis first acknowledge that be a card carry member of the aclu that some people have come to believe that have use to brand in some way to identify as people be identify in the|1950s as less than patriotic would like to know why keep repeat the phrase and what be the important issue here what be so wrong with the governor be a member of an organization which have come to the defense of among other people colonel oliver|north bush nothing be wrong with but just take a look at the position of the aclu but peter please understand the liberal do not like talk about liberal do not like when say that say be a card carry member now if that quote be wrong can repudiate right here have see authoritatively write twice and if have do an injustice and do not say be very very sorry but do not agree with a lot of most of the position of the aclu simply do not want to see the rating on movie do not want 10-year old grandchild to go into an x rat movie like those rating system do not think be right to try to take the tax exemption away from the|catholic|church do not want to see the kiddie pornographic law repeal do not want to see under god come out from currency now these be all position of the aclu and do not agree with have every right to exercise passion as what say a strong progressive liberal do not agree with that come from a different point and think be more in touch with the mainstream of america raise the same thing with on see would have find a way to sign that bill governor thompson|of|illinois do be not question patriotism go out and say the man be question patriotism and then all the liberal columnist join in be not be question judgment on these matter or where be come from have every right to do but believe that be not what the american people want and when say when say at the convention ideology do not matter just competence be move away from own record from what passion have be over the|year and that be all be try to do be put in focus and hope people do not think that be question patriotism when say use word to describe participation in that organization lehrer governor a response dukakis well hope this be the first and last time have to say this of course the vice president be question patriotism do not think there be any question about that and resent resent parent come to this country as immigrant teach that this be the great country in the world be in public service because love this country believe in and nobody be go to question patriotism as the vice president have now repeatedly the fact of the matter be if the|pledge|of|allegiance be the acid test of one 's patriotism the vice president be be the preside officer in the|united|states|senate for the|past|seven|and|a|half|year to the good of knowledge be never once suggest that a session of the senate begin with the|pledge|of|allegiance mr. bush do not question patriotism when be attack for military record immediately say be inappropriate have no place in this campaign and reject would hope that from this point on get to the issue that affect the vast majority of americans job school health care housing the environment those be the concern of the people that be watch tonight not label that attach to each other question about each other 's patriotism and loyalty lehrer the time be up governor let go now to john|mashek again a question for the vice president mashek mr. vice president in a debate during the republican primary say most of the nation 's homeless be suffer from mental illness an assertion immediately challenge by of rival estimate of the homeless range from a low of by the government to around three|million include work family and child what commitment be willing to make tonight to this voiceless segment of society bush want to see the|mckinney|act fully fund believe that that would help in term of shelter want to see when talk at convention about a point of light be talk about the enormous number of shelter and organization that help the governor 's wife have be very active in the homeless campaign chairman secretary jim|baker 's wife this be not government these be people that care that be try to give of the government have a role be to fully fund the|mckinney|act there be certain army basis that the act call for that can be use in certain case to shelter people when be rough and so think that be on the right track do not see this incidentally as a democrat or a republican or a liberal or conservative idea see an involvement by a point of light see the funding that be require and hope the congress will fully fund this bill give a great deal of conscience and a great deal of work and be on the track on this one but and look mental that be a little overstate would say around|30|percent and think maybe could look back over shoulder and wonder whether be right to let all those mental patient out maybe need to do a well job in mental clinic to help because there be a major problem there a lot of be mentally sick and have get to attend to but fully short range answer be fully fund that mckinney|act lehrer governor a response dukakis well this be another fundamental difference that have with the vice president just as do in the case of health care for member of work family in this country who do not have health insurance the problem mr. bush be that have cut back by on commitment to affordable housing for family of low and moderate income and when do that have have homeless family do not have two|and|a|half|million or three|million homeless people live on street and in doorway in this country ten|years|ago have get to begin to get back to the business of building and rehabilitate housing for family of low and moderate income in this country housing for young family that can look forward some|day to buy have get community in this country increasingly where own kid can not afford to live in the community that grow up in that be an essential commitment and think the housing community be ready but be go to take a president who be commit to housing who be have experience in building and rehabilitate housing who understand that affordable housing for family of low and moderate income for young family first time home buyer be an essential part of the american dream and while be all for the mckinney bill that by simply will not do have get to have a president that can lead on this issue that can work with the congress and be prepared to do so this be of the most important priority that face this country lehrer john a question for the governor mashek governor have mention the american dream of home ownership and be certainly become an impossible for many of the young people of nation who be catch up in this economic squeeze of the middle class as have say so frequently during the campaign and yet in spite of answer just|a|few|minutes|ago what promise can realistically hold out to these people that with the cost of housing go up and with limited help available from washington be destine to become a nation of renter dukakis well certainly hope not and be all a question of what priority be mr. bush talk about value agree with what be value be not provide housing for family of low and moderate income be not make possible for young family first time home buyer to own own home some|day something that be part of the american dream think so know back after world|war|ii when have hundreds|of|thousand of gis who come back from the war do not sit around go out and build housing the government be very much involved so be the housing industry so be the banking industry so be housing advocate so be non - profit agency so be governor and mayor and people all over this country who believe deeply in home ownership and affordable housing now that be the kind of leadership that want to provide as president of the|united|state this be not a question of a little charity for the homeless this be a question of organize the housing community have talk to banker and builder and developer the housing advocate community development agency and want leadership from washington washington by can not do all should not expect that but governor be ready mayor be ready builder and community leader be ready will require some fund john and ought to be prepared to provide those fund but that too will require some choice mr. bush want to spend billion and trillion on star wars well that be a choice have to make be not do spend money on that weapon system in the billion and trillion or be provide some decent and affordable housing for family of this country something that be at least as important and probably more so because be so essential to economic strength and to future now that be the kind of presidency believe in and simply to say well the mckinney bill will do just do not do need a president who will lead on this issue who have have experience on this issue be the kind of priority that will be at the top of list begin in january|of|1989 lehrer a response mr. vice president bush think the governor be blur housing and the homeless let talk about housing which the question be when talk to those banker do discuss where interest rate be when party control the|white|house ten|day before take the oath of office as president be now how do that grab for increase housing housing be up be serve a|million more family now but be not go to do in that old democratic liberal way of try to build more brick and mortar go out and take a look at st.|louis at some of that effort be wrong favor home ownership want to see more voucher want to see control of some of these project and want to keep the interest rate down be half now of what be when come into office and with policy of get this deficit under control will be a lot less but if spend and spend and spend that be go to wrap up the housing market and will go right back to the day of the misery index and malaise that president reagan and have overcome thank god for the|united|state on that lehrer all right the next question be to the governor ann|groer will ask groer governor dukakis be there a conflict between opposition to the death penalty and support for abortion on demand even though in the mind of many people that be also kill dukakis no do not think there be there be very different issue here and have get to be deal with separately be opposed to the death penalty think everybody know that be also very tough on violent crime and that be of the reason why state have cut crime by more than any other industrial state in america be of the reason why have the low murder rate of any industrial state in the country be of the reason why have a drug education and prevention program that be reach out and help youngster all over state the kind of thing want to do as president of the|united|state know the vice president say want to impose the death penalty on drug trafficker and yet administration have a federal furlough program which be of the most permissive in the country which give last|year furlough to drug trafficker and drug pusher the same people that say now want to execute the issue of abortion be a very difficult issue that think that all have to wrestle with have to come to term with do not favor abortion do not think be a good thing do not think most people do the question be who make the decision and think have to be the woman in the exercise of own conscience and religious belief that make that decision lehrer response mr. vice president bush well the massachusetts furlough program be unique be the only in the nation that furlough murderer who have not serve enough time to be eligible for parole the federal program do not do that no other state program do that and favor the death penalty know be tough and honest people can disagree but when a narcotic wrap up guy go in and murder a police officer think ought to pay with life and do believe would be inhibit and so be not go to furlough man like willie|horton and would meet with the victim of last escapade the rape and the brutalization of the family down there in maryland maryland would not extradite willie|horton the man who be furlough the murderer because do not want to be furlough again and so have a fundamental difference on this one and think most people know position on the sanctity of life favor adoption do not favor abortion lehrer question for the vice president ann groer yes mr. vice president would like to stay with abortion for just a moment if may over the|year have express several position while oppose nearly all form of government payment for now say that support abortion only in case of rape incest or threat to a mother 's life and also support a constitutional amendment that if ratify would outlaw most abortion but if abortion be to become illegal again do think that the woman who defy the law and have anyway as do before be okay by the|supreme|court and the doctor who perform should go to jail bush have not sort out the penalty but do know do know that oppose abortion and favor adoption and if can get this law change everybody should make the extraordinary effort to take these kid that be unwanted and sometimes abort take the let come to birth and then put in a family where will be love and see yes position have evolve and be continue to evolve and be evolve in favor of life and have have a couple of exception that support rape incest and the life of the mother sometimes people feel a little uncomfortable talk about this but be much clear for now as have see abortion sometimes use as a birth control device for heaven sake see the million of these killing accumulate and this be where can have an honest difference of opinion certainly do but no be for the sanctity of life and once that illegality be establish then can come to grip with the penalty side and of course there be get to be some penalty to enforce the law whatever may be lehrer governor dukakis well think what the vice president be say be that be prepared to brand a woman a criminal for make this decision be as simple as that do not think be enough to come before the american people who be watch tonight and say well have not sort out this be a very very difficult and fundamental decision that all of have to make and what be say if understand correctly be that be prepared to brand a woman a criminal for make this choice bush just dukakis let finish let simply say that think have to be the woman in the exercise of own conscience and religious belief that make that decision and think that be the right approach the right decision and would hope by this time that mr. bush have sort out this issue and come to term with as have respect right to disagree with but think be important that have a position that take and state to the american people lehrer peter|jenning a question for the vice president jennings mr. vice president be strike by discussion of woman and the sanctity of life and lead to recall own phrase that be haunt by the life which child in inner city live certainly the evidence be compelling there be an explosion of single parent family and by any measure these single parent family many with unwanted child be the source of poverty school drop out crime which many people in the inner city simply feel be out of control if haunt so why over the|eight|years of the reagan bush administration have so many program design to help the inner city be eliminate or cut bush of the reason and first would like to know which program be talk about and then could talk on the merit of the program but see fundamental philosophy be give local and state government as much control as possible that may be the explanation if tell the program do strongly support the wic program think be good think part of the answer to this haunting of these child that be out there and suffer lie in extension of medicaid to challenge the state and maybe be go to have to enforce more on the state in term of medicaid take care of these but peter so much of be get into a whole other phase of thing the neighborhood the kind of environment people be grow up in and that lead to the program be talk about in term of education think that part of be the crime infest neighborhood and that be why be a strong believer in try to control crime in the neighborhood why be so pleased to be endorse by the policeman on the beat the|boston|police|department the|other|day think understand commitment to help in the neighborhood and so be a combination of these thing but do not erode out of the system the point of light the people that be out there try to help these kid the program like city and school the work that barbara|bush be do so people can learn to read in this country and then go on and break this cycle of poverty be for head start and move that up and have already make a proposal and yes will cost some money but favor that so these be the combination of thing want and the fact that do not think the federal government can endorse a program do not mean have less compassion than the person who endorse such a program lehrer governor dukakis well must have be live through a different eight|year then the one the vice president be be live through because this administration have cut and slash and cut and slash program for child for nutrition for the kind of thing that can help these youngster to live well life be cut federal aid to education be cut pell grant and loan to close the door to college opportunity on youngster all over this country and that too be a major difference between the vice president and let just give other example have a great many people hundreds|of|thousand of people live on public assistance in this country the governor of this nation have propose to the congress that help those family to get off of welfare help those youngster help mother to become independent and self sufficient be take month and month and month to get mr. bush and the administration to support that legislation and be still resist that be the way help people be haunt a|thousand point of light do not know what that mean know what strong political leadership be know what be happen over the course of these program have be cut and slash and butcher and have hurt kid all over this country lehrer a question for the governor peter jennings governor the crisis be no less a crisis for if be elect president where would get the money to devote to the inner city which be clearly need and can be specific about the program not only would reinstate but the more imaginative one that would begin dukakis well say a|few|minutes|ago peter that could improve the life of family and youngster and save money at the same time welfare reform be way to do if invest in job training in child care for those youngster in some extended health benefit so that that mother and kid do not lose health benefit when go to work can help literally hundreds|of|thousands if not million of family to get off of welfare to become independent and self sufficient to be taxpaye citizen and to improve life the quality of life future and the future of those child that be just example of how can save money and improve the quality of life at the same time in own state for example now have that universal health care system which the vice president oppose think very unwisely of the great barrier to opportunity for a family and for those child be the threat that mat lose health insurance think about that father down there in houston who have to tell youngster that can not play little league ball that can not go out on the ball field because be afraid be go to get hurt and yet mr. bush say well do not think ought to expect business to provide health insurance for employee when responsible employer a majority of employer in this country do and be pay more for insurance to reimburse hospital for free care on account of people that be not insure that have to go to that hospital so these be the way that help family help youngster to live well life and more decent life be ready to go to work at the state and local level all of know the private sector be people be all over the country but take presidential leadership take a commitment to be involve and the leading and that be the kind of presidency want to lead lehrer mr. vice president bush what trouble be that when talk of the voluntary sector and a point of light and a different way to help on these problem the man have just say do not understand what be talk about this be the problem have with the big spending liberal think the only way to do be for the federal government to do all the fact happen to be that education spending be up by the federal government be up be not down but here be the point miss the federal government spend of the total on education and the rest of the state government and local government and the point of lightened be talk about private school and private church school and thing of this nature be put up but the federal spending for education be up and want to be the education president because want to see do better be put more money per child into education and be not perform as should have get away fro value and the fundamental and would like to urge the school superintendent and the other around the country to stand up now and keep move forward on a path towards real excellence and can do but it¹s not go to be dedicate by some federal bureaucracy in washington d.c. lehrer all right let move now to some question on foreign and national security policy john|mashek will ask the first question of the governor mashek governor the vice president continually refer to lack of experience weakness naivete on foreign policy and national security matter say be prepared to eliminate weapon system that will result in the unilateral disarmament of this country be that true dukakis of course not of course that be a charge that be always make against any governor who run for the presidency think be of the thing that mr. bush say about mr. reagan back in remember that george and yet some of fine president some of strong international leader be governor — franklin roosevelt woodrow|wilson theodore|roosevelt not the amount of time spend in washington be not the length of resume be strength be value be the quality of the people pick be understanding of the force of change that be sweep the world and whether or not be in a position to provide leadership to make those force of change work for and not against the vice president have a long resume but do not stop from endorse the sale of arm to the ayatollah and now know that be not out of the loop be in meeting after meet listen to secretary shultz and secretary weinberger oppose that and yet support experience do not prevent from participate or involve or in some way be involve in the relationship between this government and mr. noriega and drug trafficking in panama go to philippines in the|early|80s and commend ferdinand|marcos for commitment to democracy and continue to support a fail policy in central|america which be get bad and bad and which have in fact increase cuban and soviet influence in that region so do not believe that the fact have get that long resume or have that experience be the real question the question be value the question be strength the question be willingness to provide the kind of leadership that must be provide be ready to provide that leadership want to be the commander in chief of this country think take fresh leadership now and an understanding of those force of change to provide the kind of strength that need and perhaps the vice president can explain what be do when support the trading of arm to terrorist nation and involvement in panama and that endorsement of mr. macros but do not think be just experience that make the difference be strength be value lehrer mr. vice president bush well think the question be about defense the governor be for a nuclear freeze that would have lock in a soviet intermediate nuclear force weapon and for the west and because do not listen to the freeze advocate and strengthen the defense of this country now have the first arm control agreement in the nuclear age now be sit down and talk to the soviets about strategic arm and want to do away with the midgetman and the mx the modernization or nuclear capability that be not the way deal with the soviets have meet mr. gorbachev met mr. shevardnadze and talk substance with the other day these people be tough but now have a chance few have experience and now how to handle but please do not go back to the|days when the military be as weak as could be when the morale be down and when be the laugh stock around the world and now be back because have strengthen the defense of this country and believe do not want to see return to those day as to ferdinand|marcos be not there any more be under administration that mrs. aquino come in but will tell what be think of fly a combat mission last one be over manila and be down there fight against imperialism and have just— lehrer mr. vice president bush and just lift martial law and just call for new election and all of those thing happen because the philippines do crave democracy and out go lehrer mr. vice president time be up john a question for the vice president mashek mr. vice president the governor have suggest that have never meet a weapon system that do not like or want be prepared to tell the voter system in this time of tight budgetary restraint and problem at the pentagon that would be willing to cut or even eliminate that would not endanger national security bush do not think be a question of eliminate can tell some be against a-6f for example divad and can go on and on minuteman|iii penetration system mean there be plenty of that oppose but what be not go to do when be negotiate with the|soviet|union sit down talk to mr. gorbachev about how achieve a reduction in strategic weapon be not go to give away a couple of ace that very tough card game be simply not go to do that and under when lead this country the secretary of defense be go to have to make the choice between how keep how protect the survivability of nuclear deployment on the midgetman missile or on the minuteman whatever be be go to have to — the mx be go to have to do that be christmas bush would not be nice to be perfect dukakis hope be not christmas when make that decision bush would not be nice to be the ice man so never make a mistake these be the answer be do not make these unilateral cut and everybody now realize that peace through strength work and so this be where have a big difference of course be go to have to make some determination on this and be go to have to make on the convention force but now have get a very good concept call competitive strategy will do what do best be a strategy that have be work on for a|couple|of|year be go to take to much well advantage in conventional force but look let sum up want to be the president that get conventional force balance want to be the to banish chemical and biological weapon from the face of the earth but have to have a little bit of experience to know where to start and think have have that lehrer governor dukakis well first let say with respect to the freeze that back in the|spring|of|1982 mr. bush be a lot more sympathetic to the freeze than seem to be today as a matter of fact say be not and should not be subject to partisan demagoguery because be too important for the|united|state or for the world do not hear john exactly where be go to cut and what be go to do but know this have serious financial problem in this country have pile up over a|trillion|dollars in debt and the next president of the|united|state be go to have to make some choice mr. bush want to spend billion on star wars apparently want to spend billion on the mx on railroad car a weapon system do not need and can not afford think the administration be oppose to the midgetman think the administration be at the negotiating table in geneva suggest that ban mobile missile system entirely but those be the choice the next president of the|united|state be go to have to make be for the stealth be for the d-5 be for go ahead with the advance cruise missile but do not think need these other system do not think need to remain strong have get to move ahead with the strategic arm negotiation process with the comprehensive test ban treaty and with negotiation lead to conventional force reduction in europe with deep cut on the soviet side and senator bentsen and will pursue that policy lehrer anne|groer a question for the vice president groer well mr. vice president say have meet with secretary general gorbachev have meet with mr. shevardnadze but for the|last|40|year americans have be teach to regard the|soviet|union as the enemy yet president reagan have sign arm control treaty and be promise to share star wars technology with the very country once call the evil empire so perhaps can tell this|evening should be do a lot to help the economic and the social development of a country that have so long regard as an adversary bush what think ought to do be take a look at perestroika|and|glasnost welcome but keep eye open be cautious because the soviet change be not fully establish yet yes think be fine to do business with and so be encourage with what see when talk to mr. – what hear when talk to mr. gorbachev and mr. shevardnadze but can pull off and when have a a deal that be good for as china start to do the change in china since barbara and live there be absolutely amazing in term of incentive in partnership and thing of this nature and now the|soviet|union seem to be walk down that same path should encourage that ought to say this be good but where differ with opponent be be not go to make unilateral cut in strategic defend system or support some freeze when have superiority be not go to do that because think the jury be still out on the soviet experiment and the interesting place of the thing that fascinate about this perestroika and glasnost be wheat go to happen in see the turmoil in poland today and think have enormous opportunity for trade do not want to go back to the carter grain embargo on the soviets be once again reliable supplier and would never use food as a political tool like predecessor do but this be an exciting time but all be suggest be let not be naïve in deal with the soviet and make a lot of unilateral cut hope against hope that will match bid look at the inf treaty and if have not learn from the negotiating history on that will never learn the freeze people be wrong the reagan bush administration be right lehrer governor dukakis dukakis be a very different george|bush who be talk much more sympathetically about the freeze in than be today and be right then george when say be no time for partisan demagoguery nobody be suggest that unilaterally disarm or somehow reduce strength of course not what be talk about be a combination of a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent strong well equip well train well maintain conventional force and at the same time a willingness to move forward steadily thoughtfully cautiously have serious difference with the|soviet|union have very fundamental difference about human right democracy and basic system basic view of human being and of what life be all about but there be opportunity there now senator bentsen and have a plan for the|1990 and beyond mr. bush and mr. quayle do not and want to pursue that plan in a way which will bring down the level of nuclear armament will build a more stable and more peaceful world while make choice here at home let not forget that national security and economic security go hand in hand can not be strong militarily when be teeter totter on top of a mountain of debt which have be create in that be why need a democratic administration in washington in lehrer anne|groer a question for the governor groer yes governor dukakis speak of seem change of position have go from call the strategic defense initiative or star wars a fantasy and a fraud to say recently that would continue sdi research and may even deploy the system if congress support such a move why the change of heart dukakis no there be be no change of heart say from the beginning that ought to continue research into the strategic system at about the level that be add in that be about|a|billion|dollar a year but do not know of any reputable scientist who believe that this system at least as originally conceive could possibly work this notion of some kind of astrodome over that could protect from enemy attack make real sense and as a matter of fact the system that the administration be now talk about be very different from the one that be originally propose in so be for continued research but also want strong conventional force now the|other|day mr. bush say well if continue with star|war — star|wars have to cut some place have not tell where know where be cut know where be cut right now be cut into the fiber and muscle of conventional force be cut back on maintenance and equipment an air|force|general not too long ago in europe who say that pretty soon would have airplane without engine tank commander who can not drive tank more than quarter of a mile because do not have enough fuel coast|guard cutter tie up at the dock this|summer not patrol be suppose to be first line of defense against drug and the war against drug because do not have enough fuel have to make choice be not make those choice and to spend billions|and|billions|of|dollar as mr. bush apparently want to although have be all over the lot on this issue lately on star wars in judgment make no sense at all need a strong credible effective nuclear deterrent have strategic nuclear warhead right now on land on sea and in the air enough to blow up time over have about|12,000 so have get to move forward with those negotiation get the level of strategic weapon down but to continue to commit billion to this system make no sense at all and think mr. bush have be reconsider position over the course of the|past|few|week that's at least that be what read maybe will tell where stand on tonight lehrer mr. vice president bush be not reconsider position question how do deter nuclear attack without modernize nuclear force when the soviets be modernize and how come spend willing to spend a dime on something that consider a fantasy and a fraud those be hypo rhetorical question be the man on conventional force that want to eliminate carrier battle group the armed force the conventional force of the|united|state have never be more ready every single of the|joint|chiefs will testify to the fact that readiness be in an historic high and secondly in term of the cutting of the|coast|guard the democratic control congress so please help with that who cut from the|coast|guard out of the interdiction effort on narcotic be get to get this thing more clear why do spend a|billion|dollar on something think be a fantasy and a fraud will fully research go forward as fast as can have set up the level of funding and when be deployable will deploy that be position on sdi and be never waver a bit lehrer peter|jenning a question for governor dukakis jennings well governor and vice president bush have both talk tonight about hard choice let try to give one somewhere in the|middle|east tonight americans be be hold hostage if be commander in chief and americans be hold hostage what will be more important to individual fate or the commitment that the united|states government must never negotiate with terrorist and if any americans be hold hostage and become president to what length would go to rescue dukakis peter be of the most agonizing decision a president have to make these be american citizen care deeply about family care deeply about want back and understandably so and want to do everything can to bring back but if there be thing also understand be that can not make concession to terrorist ever ever because if do be an open invitation to other terrorist to take hostage and to blackmail and that be the tragedy of the iran contra scandal as a matter of fact mr. bush be the chairman of a task force on international terrorism which issue a report shortly before that decision be make and say and rightly so that never ever can make concession to terrorist and hostage taker and yet after sit through meeting after meeting endorse that decision endorse the sale of arm to the ayatollah in exchange for hostage of the most tragic of the most mistaken foreign policy decision have ever make in this country and dare say encouraged other to take hostage as now know so there can be no concession under any circumstance because if do be an open invitation to other to do the same have get to be tough on international terrorism have get to treat as international crime have get to attack at all point have go to use undercover operation have to be prepared to use military force against terrorist base camp have to work closely with ally to make sure that be work with and with and can give no quarter when come to break the back of international terrorism yes should make every effort to try to help those hostage come home but can never be because make concession that be a tragic mistake that make a mistake that mr. bush make and other make and should never ever be make again lehrer mr. vice president bush write the anti - terrorist report for this government be the good anti - terrorist report write yes should not trade arm for hostage but have make vast improvement in anti - terrorism now be fine to say that sometimes have to hit base camp but when the president see this state sponsor fingerprint of muammar|khadaffi on the loss of american life hit libya and opponent be unwilling to support that action dukakis that be not true that be not true bush and since that action terrorist action against the|united|state citizen have go down dukakis that be not true bush and have long ago say support the president on this other matter and have say mistake be make clearly nobody be go to think the president start out think be go to trade arm for hostage that be a very serious charge against the president the matter have be thoroughly look into but the point be sometimes the action have to be take by the federal government and when take action have a favorable response lehrer a question for the vice president peter jennings seem perhaps a good subject mr. vice president on which to make the point that have campaign vigorously as part of a leadership team but so far will not tell the american people in considerable measure what advice give the president include the sale of arm to iran and what should have be do about the hostage to the good of knowledge there be no constitutional requirement which prevent from do so jimmy|carter urge vice president walter|mondale to tell the american people would now ask president reagan for permission to tell the american people what advice do give and if do not how do judge judgment in the|oval|office in the|last|eight|years bush be judge by the whole record be judge by the entire record be close to peace be do better in anti - terrorism should have listen to opponent who want to send the un into the|persian|gulf or in spite of the mistake of the past be do better there how be credibility with the gcc country on the western side of the gulf be iran talk to iraq about peace judge on the record be the soviet come out of afghanistan how do look in a program call or some of these marvelous boston adjective up there and — about angola now have a chance — several bostonians do not like but the rest of the country will understand now have a chance now have a chance and so think that would leave right there and say that judge on the whole record and let say this all can talk about go around rant about noriega now have tell what the intelligence briefing receive say about that can talk about iran contra and also i'll make a deal with will take the blame for those incident if give half the credit for all the good thing that have happen in world peace since ronald|reagan and take over from the carter administration still have a|couple|of|minute leave and there be a difference principle lehrer sorry mr. vice president bush be only on yellow here wait a minute lehrer be wrong go ahead apology bush jim lehrer say nobody 's perfect bush say be not perfect where be dukakis 25th of december mr. vice president bush finish dukakis can have another|ten|second if want jim lehrer governor have a minute to respond dukakis well the matter of judgment be very important and think be important to understand what happen here a report on international terrorism chair by the vice president be release and make some very specific recommendation about how to deal with terrorism be ignore the vice president ignore say mistake be make very serious mistake in judgment be make say well let concede that the administration have be do business with noriega have make a part of foreign policy and have be funnel aid to contras through convict drug dealer think those be very very serious question of judgment which those of who be watch here tonight have a right to judge and review be not go to make those kind of mistake can not make concession to terrorist if do invite the taking of more hostage that be a basic principle be ignore in that case and be a very very serious mistake in judgment lehrer a question from john|mashek go to the vice president mashek mr. vice president democrats and even some republicans be still express reservation about the qualification and credential of senator dan|quayle of indiana choose running mate to be a heartbeat away from the presidency what do see in that other do not bush see a young man that be elect to the senate twice to the|house|of|representatives twice see a man who be young and be put confidence in a whole generation of people that be in 30s|and|40s see a man that take the leadership in the|job|training|partnership|act and that retrain people in this highly competitive change society be in so if a person lose hob be retrain for a benefit for a work that will be productive and will not have to go on of these many program that the liberal talk about see a young man who be a knowledgeable in defense and there be people on ticket that be knowledgeable in the whole in the race knowledgeable in defense and dan|quayle be of and be of and believe that will be outstanding and take a tremendous pounding and everybody now know that take a very unfair pounding and would like each person to say do jump to conclusion run down rumor that be so outrageous and so brutal and be keep head up and will do very very well and have full confidence and will have the confidence of people that be in 30 and 40 and more so judge the man on record not on the — lot of rumor and innuendo and try to fool around with name opponent say do know who j.|danforth be be a man who give life in world|war|ii so ridicule a person 's name be a little beneath this process and will do very well when get into the debate dukakis well when come to ridicule george win a gold medal think can agree on that in the course of this campaign bush just the fact dukakis but do — do sense a desire that maybe lloyd|bentsen ought to be running mate when say there be people on ticket bush no think the debate ought to be between and lloyd dukakis think the american people have a right to judge on this question on how pick a running mate a person who be a heartbeat away from the presidency pick lloyd|bentsen distinguished strong mature a leader in the senate somebody whose qualification nobody have question mr. bush pick doubt very much that dan|quayle be the good qualified person for that job and as a matter of fact think for most people the notion of president quayle be a very very troubling thought lehrer john will ask a question of the governor will be the last question and then the vice president will have a rebuttal mashek well governor do select lloyd|bentsen of texas dukakis do indeed mashek and have a lot of disagreement with on fundamental issue include the reagan tax cut aid to the rebel in nicaragua the death penalty gun control who be right dukakis well john be a man that be be a chief executive for ten|year have pick a lot of people have pick cabinet have name judge know that the people pick make an enormous difference in ability to govern and set high standard try to meet and insist that people who work for meet if do not do not stick around very long but do not pick lloyd|bentsen because be a clone of mike|dukakis pick because be somebody who would be a strong vice president somebody who would be an active vice president somebody who would come to if somebody come up with a crazy idea that ought to trade arm to the ayatollah for hostage and say mr. president that be wrong should not do that that be the kind of vice president want have say and rightly so that will be a strong vice president when the vice president make a decision that will be decision and be very very proud of that choice and do not pick because agree with on everything know sam|rayburn once say that if people agree on everything then only|one person be do the thinking the fact be have pick somebody who not only will be a great vice president but if god forbid something happen to the president could step into that office and do so with distinction and with strength and with leadership doubt very much doubt very much that mr. bush 's selection for the vice presidency of the|united|states meet that test lehrer mr. vice president bush well — obviously have a difference believe do meet the test will have an opportunity to see the of in action in a friendly forum wonderful friendly fashion like this have hope this have be a|little|friendlier|evene want to hitchhike a ride home in tank with but now have get the line too carefully draw here but talk about judgment mean what kind of judgment mean jump all over the president on decision on area of farm policy what kind of judgment sense have chief education adviser now in jail in massachusetts mean there' — do not think this be a fair argument but nevertheless support nominee for vice president and will do an outstanding job lehrer gentlemen be give some bad word a moment ago there be time for more question get in ear and ann|groer will ask ann to the governor groer governor dukakis as many u.s. farmer face or undergo foreclosure be consider the possibility of forgive a certain percentage of debt owe by latin|american and third world country do favor give these country a break in loan and if so how do explain that to the american farmer who be lose land and livelihood dukakis well think have to go to work on the problem of third world debt and have get to assist those third world country in deal with this massive debt which currently which have incur and which be burden and which if do not do something about and assist along with other nation around the world will destroy economy destroy future and at the same time will destroy market that be important to farmer but also believe need an agricultural policy which do not cost to dollar a year that be be cost over the course of the|past|three|or|four|years under this administration think be go to require good solid credit policy and thank to the congress now have an agricultural credit bill which be help and improve the situation with at least some of farmer think be go to require a combination of supply management and reasonable price support to make sure that farmer get a decent price and think also be go to require an administration that understand that there be tremendous opportunity out there for the development of new us for agricultural product new us which can help to clean up environment at the same time bio degradable plastic — plastic — gasohol which the vice president have be involve in road de icer make from corn product mean there be enormous opportunity out there to expand market and to build a strong future for farmer but do not think there be anything mutually exclusive or contradictory about build a strong farm economy in this country and assist family farm and provide a good strong future for rural community and for rural america and at the same time work on third world debt as a matter of fact mexico be of big agricultural customer so in the sense that can work to help mexico rebuild and expand and deal with these very serious economic problem help farmer at the same time lehrer mr. vice president bush oppose supply management and production control support the farm bill the farm bill and spending be move in the right direction want to expand market abroad and that be why have call for that first economic summit to be on agriculture will not go back to the way the democrats do and use food as a political weapon and throw a grain embargo on the farmer in this country want to see rural redevelopment and have be out front in favor of alternate source of energy and of be gasohol and come from use corn and think can do better in term of biodegradable for a lot of product so be optimistic about the agricultural economy in term of the third world support the baker plan want to see market economy spring up all around the world and to the degree do be succeed and do not want to see the bank let off the hook would oppose that but think be on the right track in agriculture and be very very encouraged but let not go back to that what call supply management and production control that will simply price out of the international market let try to expand market abroad lehrer all right that really be the end now let go to closing statement will be two|minute each in duration by agreement vice president bush go first governor dukakis second mr. vice president bush talk in new|orlean about a gentle and kind nation and have make specific proposal on education and the environment and on ethic and energy and how do better in battle crime in country but there be main focal point of this election opportunity and peace want to keep this expansion go yes want change but be the change be the change do not want to go back to malaise and misery index and so opportunity keep|america at work the good poverty program be a job with dignity in the private sector and in term of peace be on the right track have achieve an arm control agreement that critic think be never possible and want to build on want to see finalize that start agreement and want to be the one to finally lead the world to banishing chemical and biological weapon want to see asymmetrical reduction in conventional force and then get down to a question of value have have a chance to spell out difference on the|pledge|of|allegiance here tonight and on tough sentencing of drug king pin and this kind of thing and do favor the death penalty and have get a wide array of difference on those but in the final analysis in the final analysis the person go into that voting booth be go to say who have the value believe in who have the experience that trust who have the integrity and stability to get the job do fellow americans be that man and ask for support thank very much dukakis this have be an|extraordinary|18|month for kitty and and for family have have an opportunity to campaign all over this country and to meet with so many of in community and state and region to get to know be more optimistic today than be when begin about this nation provide have the kind of leadership in washington that can work with that can build partnership that can build job in every part of this country not certain part of this country know friend parent come to this country as immigrant

affordable housing that people can buy and own and live in so that end the shame of hopelessness in america with decent and affordable healthcare for all work family yes be a tough problem as mr. bush say but it¹s not an insolvable problem be one that will solve and must solve with a clean and wholesome environment and with a strong america that be strong militarily and economically as must be an

be talk about instead of and now hear talk that be time for a change well lady and gentleman another friendly reminder be the change roll up sleeve and go to work in january|of|1981 focus on hope not despair challenge the fail policy of the past because believe that a society be great not because of promise make by government but only because of progress make by people and that be change say something shocking taxis ought to be reduce not raise cut the tax rate for the work folk of america index taxis and that stop a bracket creep which kick average wage earner into high tax bracket when have only receive a cost of living pay raise and initiate reform of the unfairness in tax system and what do know the top of earner be pay a high percentage of the total tax revenue at the low rate than ever have before and million of earner at the bottom of the scale have be free from pay any income tax at all that be change so together pull out of a tailspin and create good job that be more|than|a|quarter of a new job a month every month for america be work again and just since convention have create of those new job now just why would friend on the other side want to change that why do think put out of work be well than put to work new home be be build new car sale reach record level export be start to climb again factory capacity be approach maximum use know have notice do not call reaganomics anymore laughter as for inflation well that too have change change from the time hit in down to between|3.5|and|4|percent interest rate be less|than|half of what be in fact nearly|half of all mortgage take out on family home in and more|than|a|third of those in be actually old loan be refinance at the new low rate young family have finally be able to get some relief these too be change rebuild armed|force liberate grenada from the communists and help return that island to democracy strike a firm blow against libyan terrorism have see the growth of democracy in of the soviets have begin to pull out of afghanistan the bloody iran iraq war be come to an end and for the first time in have the prospect of peace in southwest|africa and the removal of cuban and other foreign force from the region and in the|2,765|days of administration not i inch of ground have fall to the communists the president today have the first treaty in world history to eliminate an entire class of u.s. and soviet nuclear missile be work on the strategic defense initiative to defend and ally against nuclear terror and american and soviet relation be the good have ever be since world|war|ii and virtually all this change occur and continue to occur in spite of the resistance of those liberal elite who loudly proclaim that be time for a change resist defense buildup resist tax cut resist cut the fat out of government and resist appointment of judge commit to the law and the constitution and be time for some more straight talk this time be about the budget deficit yes be much too high but the president do not vote for a budget and the president can not spend a dime only the congress can do that blame the defense increase for the deficit yet defense spending today in real dollar be almost exactly what be in a period congress cut defense spending authority by over|$125|billion and for every reduction in defense outlay add to domestic spending now if have pass first budget first spending plan in the cumulative outlay and deficit would have be low by every single year have be in office have support and call for a balanced budget amendment to the constitution and the liberal have say no every year call for the line item veto which governors have to cut fat in the budget and the liberal have say no every year have attempt to limit wild spending spree and have say no would have believe that runaway budget deficit begin in when take office well let tell something the fact be when begin war on poverty in the|middle|sixties from through just those the budget increase to time what have be and the deficit go up|to|52 time what have be before war on poverty now do not know that if be elect answer will be the one have rely on in the past and that be high taxis the other party have control the|house|of|representatives for out of the|last|56|year have control the senate also for of those year where really need a change be to elect republican majority in both houses and then george|bush can have a team that will protect tax cut keep america strong hold down inflation and interest rate appoint judge to preserve right and yes reduce the budget deficit early in the first term set out to reduce federal regulation that have be impose on the people on business and on local and state government today be proud to say that have eliminate so many unnecessary regulation that government require paperwork impose on citizen business and other level of government have be reduce by an|estimated|600|million man hour of paperwork a|year and george be there no have not hear all yet george|bush head up that task force that eliminate those regulation in and before take 7|week to get a social|security card now take only take to get a passport use to take take to get an export license now be only|17|day and for some country take over to process a claim for a|department|of|housing|and|urban|development title i day now take fourth of that—22 day think these specific suggest there be a new level of competent management in the departments of government george play a major role in everything that have accomplish in these|8|year now early on have a foreign policy problem nato ally be under the threat of soviet intermediate range missile and nato have no equivalent deterrent effort to provide a deterrent pershing and ground launch cruise missile on the nato line result in political problem for nato ally there be objection on the part of many other people to deployment of missile george represent in brussels with the head of the nato country and agree when finish to take the missile this subsequently persuade the soviets to sign the inf treaty and begin remove ss-20 's none of achievement happen by accident but only because overcome liberal opposition to put program in place and without george|bush to build on those policy everything have achieve will be at risk all the work sacrifice and effort of the american people could end in the very same disaster that inherit in because feel so strongly about the work that must continue and the need to protect gain for the american family and for national security want to share with the quality should seek in the next president need someone who be big enough and experience enough to handle tough and demand negotiation with mr. gorbachev because this be no time to gamble with on the job training need someone who be prepared to be president and who have the commitment to stand up for against massive new taxis and who will keep alive the hope and promise that keep economy strong will take somebody who have see this office from the inside who sense the danger point will be cool under fire and know the range of answer when the tough question come well that be the george|bush that have see up close when the staff and cabinet member have close the door and when the of be alone someone who be not afraid to speak mind and who can cut to the core of an issue someone who never run away from a fight never back away from belief and never make excuse this office be not to give only the people can do that but love america too much and care too much about where will be in the|next|few|year care that give custody of this office to someone who will build on change not retreat to the past someone who will continue the change all of fight for to preserve what have and not risk lose all america need george|bush — and barbara|bush as first lady okay all right with george|bush will know as approach the new millennium child will have a future secure with a nation at peace and protect against aggression will have a prosperity that spread the blessing of abundance and opportunity across all america will have safe and active neighborhood drug free school that send child soar in the atmosphere of great idea and deep value and a nation confidently willing to take leadership into the uncharted reach of a new age so george be in corner be ready to volunteer a little advice now and then and offer a pointer or on strategy if ask will help keep the fact straight or just stand back and cheer but george just personal request go out there and win for the gipper as can imagine be sorely tempt to spend the rest of this evening tell the truth about friend who meet in atlanta but then why should have all the fun laughter so for the next few moment let talk about the future this be the last republican convention will address as president maybe will see way to invite back sometime but like so many of as say earlier start out in the other party but cast last vote as a democrat be a party in which franklin|delano|roosevelt promise the return of power to the states be a party where harry|truman commit a strong and resolute america to preserve freedom f.d.r. have run on a platform of eliminate useless board and commission and return autonomy and authority to local government and to the states that party change and will never be the same leave do not leave so be that give a political home when sign up for duty do not have to check principle at the door and soon find out that the desire for victory do not overcome devotion to ideal and what ideal those have be party speak for human freedom for the sweep of liberty that be at the core of existence do not shirk from duty to preserve freedom so can unfold across the world for yearn million believe that last peace come only through strength and not through the good will of adversary have a healthy skepticism of government check excess at the same time be willing to harness energy when help improve the life of citizen have pretty strong notion that high tax receipt be no inherent right of the|federal|government do not think that inflation and high interest rate show compassion for the poor the young and the elderly respect the value that bind together as family and as a nation for child do not think be wrong to have commit to pledge each|day to the nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all and have so many requirement in classroom why can not at least have thing that is voluntary and that be allow kid to repair quietly to faith to say a prayer to start the|day as congress do for the unborn quite simply should not be able to live to become child in those classroom those be some of principle in this room and million like watch and

struggle along the way yes be what learn from fail like an athlete in competition or a scholar in pursuit of the truth experience be the great teacher and that be why be so hard for government planner no matter how sophisticated to ever substitute for million of individual work night and day to make dream come true the fact be bureaucracy be a problem around the world there be an old story about a town could be anywhere — with a bureaucrat who be know to be a good for nothing but somehow have always hang on to power so in a town meeting an old woman get up and say to there be a folk legend here where come from that when a baby be bear an angel come down from heaven and kiss on part of body if the angel kiss on hand become a handyman if kiss on forehead become bright and clever and have be try to figure out where the angel kiss so that should sit there for so long and do nothing laughter be see the power of economic freedom spread around the world place such as the|republic|of|korea singapore taiwan have vault into the technological era barely pause in the industrial age along the way low tax agricultural policy in the subcontinent mean that in some|years india be now a net exporter of food perhaps most exciting be the wind of change that be blow over the|people's|republic|of|china where quarter of the world 's population be now get first taste of economic freedom at the

over|90|percent do in the philippines in the|republic|of|korea free contest democratic election be the order of the|day throughout the world free market be the model for growth democracy be the standard by which government be measure americans make no secret of belief in freedom in fact be something of a national pastime the american people choose a new president and be of those|year at point there be major candidate run in the major party not to mention all the other include the socialist and libertarian candidate all try to get job about|1,000 local television station radio station and daily newspaper each one an independent private enterprise fiercely independent of the government — report on the candidate grill in interview and bring together for debate in the end the people

many place synagogue and mosque and will see family of every conceivable nationality worship together go into any schoolroom and there will see child be teach the|declaration|of|independence that be endow by creator with certain unalienable right among life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that no government can justly deny the guarantee in constitution for freedom of speech freedom of assembly and freedom of religion go into any courtroom and there will preside an independent judge beholden to no government power there every defendant have the right to a trial by a jury of peer usually man and woman — common citizen be the one the only one who weigh the evidence and decide on guilt or innocence in that court the accuse be innocent until prove guilty and the word of a policeman or any official have no great legal standing than the word of the accuse go to any university campus and there will find an open sometimes heat discussion of the problem in american society

become the law of the land march in any demonstration and there be many of the people 's right of assembly be guarantee in the constitution and protect by the police go into any union hall where the member know right to strike be protect by law as a matter of fact of the many job have before this one be be president of a union the|screen|actors|guild lead union out on strike and be proud to say win but freedom be more even than this freedom be the right to question and change the establish way of do thing be the continue revolution of the marketplace be the understanding that allow to recognize shortcoming and seek solution be the right to put forth an idea scoff at by the expert and watch catch fire among the people be the right to dream to follow dream or stick to conscience even if be the only in a sea of doubter freedom be the recognition that no single person no single authority or government have a monopoly on the truth but that every individual life be infinitely precious that every of put on this world have be put there for a reason and have something to offer america be a nation make up of hundred of nationality tie to be more than one of good feeling be tie of kinship in america will find russians armenians ukrainians people from and central|asia come from every part of this vast continent from every continent to live in harmony seek a place where each cultural heritage be respect each be value for diverse strength and beauty and the richness bring to life recently a few individual and family have be allow to visit relative in the west can only hope that will not be long before all be allow to do so and ukrainian americans baltic americans armenian americans can freely visit homeland just as this irish american visit freedom have be say make people selfish and materialistic but americans be of the most religious people on earth because know that liberty just as life be not earn but a gift from god seek to share that gift with the world reason and experience say george|washington in farewell address both forbid to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle and be substantially true that virtue or morality be a necessary spring of popular government democracy be less a system of government than be a system to keep government limit unintrusive a system of constraint on power to keep politic and government secondary to the important thing in life the true source of value find only in family and faith but hope know go on about these thing not simply to extol the virtue of own country but to speak to the true greatness of the heart and soul of land who after all need to tell the land of dostoyevsky about the quest for truth the home of kandinsky and scriabin about imagination the rich and noble culture of the uzbek man of letter alisher|navoi about beauty and heart the great culture of diverse land speak with a glowing passion to all humanity let cite of the most eloquent contemporary passage on human freedom come not from the literature of america but from this country from of the great writer of the|20th|century boris|pasternak in the novel dr. zhivago write think that if the beast who sleep in man could be hold down by threat any kind of threat whether of jail or of retribution after death then the high emblem of humanity would be the lion tame in the circus with whip not the prophet who sacrifice but this be just the point what have for century raise man above the beast be not the cudgel but an inward music the irresistible power of unarmed truth the irresistible power of unarmed truth today the world look expectantly to sign of change step toward great freedom in the|soviet|union watch and hope as see positive change take place there be some know in society who fear that change will bring only disruption and discontinuity who fear to embrace the hope of the future sometimes take faith be like that scene in the cowboy movie butch|cassidy and the sundance kid which some here in moscow recently have a chance to see the posse be close in on the outlaw butch and sundance who find trap on the edge of a cliff with a sheer drop of hundreds|of|feet to the rage rapid below butch turn to sundance and say only hope be to jump into the river below but sundance refuse say would rather fight out with the posse even though be hopelessly outnumbered butch say that be suicide and urge to jump but sundance still refuse and finally admit can not swim butch break up laugh and say crazy fool the fall will probably kill and by the way both butch and sundance make in case do not see the movie think what have just be talk about be perestroika and what goal be but change would not mean rejection of the past like a tree grow strong through the season root in the earth and draw life from the sun so too positive change must be root in traditional value in the land in culture in family and community and must take life from the eternal thing from the source of all life which be faith such change will lead to new understanding new opportunity to a broad future in which the tradition be not supplant but find full flowering that be the future beckoning to generation at the same time should remember that reform that be not institutionalize will always be insecure such freedom will always be look over shoulder a bird on a tether no matter how long the rope can always be pull back and that be why in conversation with general secretary gorbachev have speak of how important be to institutionalize change to put guarantee on reform and have be talk together about|one sad reminder of a divided world the|berlin|wall be time to remove the barrier that keep people apart be propose an increase exchange program of high school student between country general secretary gorbachev mention on sunday a wonderful phrase have in russian for this well to see something once than to hear about a time mr. gorbachev and first begin work on this in in discussion today agree on work up to several|thousand exchange a year from each country in the near future but not everyone can travel across the continent and ocean word travel light and that be why would like to make available to this country more of magazine and periodical and television and radio show that can be beam off a satellite in second nothing would please more than for the soviet people to get to know better and to understand way of life just|a|few|years|ago few would have imagine the progress nation have make together the inf treaty which general secretary gorbachev and sign last|december in washington and whose instrument of ratification will exchange tomorrow the first true nuclear arm reduction treaty in history call for the elimination of an entire class of u.s. and soviet nuclear missile and just|16|days|ago see the beginning of withdrawal from afghanistan which give hope that soon the fighting may end and the healing may begin and that that suffer country may find self determination unity and peace at long last be fervent hope that constructive cooperation on these issue will be carry on to address the continue destruction and conflict in many region of the globe and that the serious discussion that lead to the|geneva|accord on afghanistan will help lead to solution in southern africa ethiopia cambodia the|persian|gulf and central|america have often say nation do not distrust each other because be armed be armed because distrust each other if this globe be to live in peace and prosper if be to embrace all the possibility of the technological revolution then nation must renounce once and for all the right to an expansionist foreign policy peace between nation must be an endure goal not a tactical stage in a continue conflict have be tell that there be a popular song in country perhaps know — whose evocative refrain ask the question do the russians want a war in answer say go ask that silence linger in the air above the birch and poplar there beneath those tree the soldier lie go ask mother ask wife then will have to ask no more do the russians want a war but what of time ally what of those who embrace on the elbe what if be to ask the watery grave of the pacific or the european battlefield where america 's fall be bury far from home what if be to ask mother sister and son do americans want war ask too and will find the same answer the same longing in every heart people do not make war government do and no mother would ever willingly sacrifice son for territorial gain for economic advantage for ideology a people free to choose will always choose peace american seek always to make friend of old antagonist after a colonial revolution with britain have cement for all age the tie of kinship between nation after a terrible civil|war between north|and|south heal wound and find true unity as a nation fight world war in lifetime against germany and with japan but now the|federal|republic|of|germany and japan be of close ally and friend some people point to the trade dispute between as a sign of strain but be the friction of all family and the family of free nation be a big and vital and sometimes boisterous can tell that nothing would please heart more than in lifetime to see american and soviet diplomat grapple with the problem of trade dispute between america and a grow exuberant export soviet|union that have open up to economic freedom and growth and as important as these official people to people exchange be nothing would please more than for to become unnecessary to see travel between east and west become so routine that university student in the|soviet|union could take a|month off in the|summer and just like student in the west do now put pack on back and travel from country to country in europe with barely a passport cheek in between nothing would please more than to see the|day that a concert promoter in say england could call up a soviet rock group without go through any government agency and have play in liverpool the next night be this just a dream perhaps but be a dream that be responsibility to have come true generation be live in of the most exciting hopeful time in soviet history be a time when the first breath of freedom stir the air and the heart beat to the accelerated rhythm of hope when the accumulate spiritual energy of a long silence yearn to break free be remind of the famous passage near the end of gogol 's dead|soul compare nation to a speeding troika gogol ask what will be destination but write there be no answer save the bell pour forth marvelous sound do not know what the conclusion will be of this journey but be hopeful that the promise of reform will be fulfil in this moscow spring this may|1988 may be allow that hope that freedom like the fresh green sapling plant over tolstoy 's grave will blossom forth at last in the rich fertile soil of people and culture may be allow to hope that the marvelous sound of a new openness will keep rise through ring through lead to a new world of reconciliation friendship and peace thank all very much and da vas gospod god bless mr. logunov dear friend mr. president have kindly agree to answer question but since do not have too much time only|15|minute so those who have question please ask strategic arms reduction q and this be a student from the history faculty and say that be happy to welcome on behalf of the student of the university and the first question be that the improvement in the relation between the country have come about during tenure as president and in this regard would like to ask the follow question be very important to get a handle on the question of arm control and specifically the limitation of strategic arm do think that will be possible for and the general secretary to get a treaty on the limitation of strategic arm during the time that be still president president reagan well the arm treaty that be be negotiate now be the so call start treaty and be base on take the intercontinental ballistic missile and reduce by half down to parity between country now this be a much more complicated treaty than the inf treaty the intermediate range treaty which have sign and which government have ratify and be now in effect so there be many thing still to be settle and have have negotiator in geneva for month work on various point of this treaty once have hope that maybe like the inf treaty would have be able to sign here at this summit meeting be not complete there be still some point that be be debate be both hopeful that can be finish before leave office which be in the|coming|january but assure that if isn't — assure that will have impress on successor that must carry on until be sign dream have always be that once have start down this road can look forward to a day can look forward to a day when there will be no more nuclear weapon in the world at all young people q the question be the university influence public opinion and the student wonder how the youth have change since the|days when be a student up until now president reagan well wait a|minute how have change since the era of own youth q how just student have change the youth have change be a student laughter at time there be type how have change president reagan well know there be a period in country when there be a very great change for the bad when be governor of california could start a riot just by go to a campus but that have all change and could be look out at an american student body as well as be look out here and would not be able to tell the difference between think that back in day do happen to go to school get college education in a unique time be the time of the|great|depression when in a country like own there be 25-percent unemployment and the bottom seem to have fall out of everything but have think what maybe should be tell from point here because graduate in that should tell that when get to be age be go to be surprise how much recall the feeling have in these|day here and that — how easy be to understand the young people because of own have be young once know an awful lot more about be young than do about be old laughter and think there be a seriousness think there be a sense of responsibility that young people have and think that there be an awareness on the part of most of about what want adulthood to be and what the country live in — want to be and have a great deal of faith say the other day to student be half american and half russian have hold a conference here and in finland and then in the|united|state and face just the other day and have to say — could not tell the difference look at which be which but say line to say believe that if all the young people of the world today could get to know each other there would never be another war and think that of think that of the other student that have address in other place and of course know also that be young and therefore there be certain thing that at time take precedence will illustrate five|year after graduate alma mater bring back to the school and give an honorary degree and have to tell compound a sense of guilt have nurse for because always feel the first degree give be honorary laughter be great carry on regional conflict q mr. president have just mention that welcome the effort settlement of the afghanistan question and the difference of other regional conflict what conflict do mean central|america conflict southeast|asian or president reagan well for example in south|africa where namibia have be promise independence as a nation another new african nation but be impossible because of a civil war go on in another country there and that civil war be be fight on side by some|30,000 to cuban troop who have go from the americas over there and be fight on side with kind of authoritative government when that country be free from be a colony and give independence faction seize power and make the government of that nation and leader of another — seem the majority of the people have want simply the people to have the right to choose the government that want and that be the civil war that be go on but what believe be that those foreign soldier should get out and let settle let the citizen of that nation settle problem and the same be true in nicaragua nicaragua have be — nicaragua make a promise have a dictator there be a revolution there be an organization that and be aid by other in the revolution and appeal to the|organization|of|american|states for help in get the dictator to step down and stop the killing and do but the|organization|of|american|state have ask what be the goal of the revolution and be give in writing and be the goal of pluralistic society of the right of union and freedom of speech and press and so forth and free election a pluralistic society and then the group that be the best organize among the revolutionary seize power exile many of the other leader and have own government which violate every of the promise that have be make and here again want we're try to encourage the get back those or make those promise come true and let the people of that particular country decide fate soviet mias in afghanistan q esteem mr. president be very much anxious and concerned about the destiny of soviet soldier be miss in afghanistan be willing to help in search and return to the motherland president reagan very much so would like nothing well than that u.s. constitution q the reservation of the inalienable right of citizen guarantee by the constitution face certain problem for example the right of people to have arm or for example the problem appear an evil appear whether spread of pornography or narcotic be compatible with these right do believe that these problem be just unavoidable problem connect with democracy or could be avoid president reagan well if understand correctly this be a question about the inalienable right of the people do that include the right to do criminal act for example in the use of drug and so forth no no have a set of law think what be significant and different about system be that every country have a constitution and most constitution or practically all of the constitution in the world be document in which the government tell the people what the people can do constitution be different and the difference be in word almost escape everyone the word be the people constitution be a document in which the people tell the government what power be and can have no power other than those list in that document but very carefully at the same time the people give the government the power with regard to those thing which think would be destructive to society to the family to the individual and so forth infringement on right and thus the government can enforce the law but that have all be dictate by the people president 's retirement plans q mr. president from history know that people who have be connect with great power with big post say goodbye leave these post with great difficulty since term of office be come to an end what sentiment do experience and whether feel like if hypothetically can just stay for another term laughter president reagan well will tell something think be a kind of revenge against franklin|delano|roosevelt who be elect time the only president there have kind of grow a tradition in country about|two term that tradition be start by washington first president only because there be great talk at the formation of country that may become a monarchy and have just free from a monarchy so when the second term be over george|washington step down and say would do step down so that there would not get to be the kind of idea of an inherited aristocracy well succeed president many of do not get a chance at a second term do term and be go but that tradition kind of remain but be just a tradition and then roosevelt run the time die very early in fourth term and suddenly in the atmosphere at that time add an amendment to the|constitution|that|president could only serve term when get out of office can not do this while be in office because will look as be selfishly do for when get out of office be go to travel around what call the mash potato circuit that be the after dinner speaking and the speaking to luncheon group and so forth i'm go to travel around and try to convince the people of country that should wipe out that amendment to the constitution because be an interference with the democratic right of the people the people should be allow to vote for who want to vote for for as many time as want to vote for and that be who be be deny a right but see will no longer be president then so can do that and talk for that there be a few other thing be go to try to convince the people to impress upon congress the thing that should be do have always describe that if in hollywood when be there if do not sing or dance wound up as an afterdinner speaker and do not sing or dance laughter so have a hunch that will be out on the speak circuit tell about a few thing that do not get do in government but urge the people to tell the congress want do american indians q mr. president have hear that a group of american|indians have come here because could not meet in if fail to meet here will be able to correct and to meet back in the|united|state president reagan do not know that have ask to see if have come here or whether to see there laughter would be very happy to see let tell just a little something about the american indian in land have provide millions|of|acre of land for what be call preservation or reservation should say from the beginning announce that want to maintain way of life as have always live there in the desert and the plain and so forth and set up these reservation so could and have a|bureau|of|indian|affair to help take care of at the same time provide education for school on the reservation and be free also to leave the reservation and be american citizen among the rest of and many do some still prefer however that way — that early way of life and have do everything can to meet demand as to how want to live maybe make a mistake maybe should not have humor in that want to stay in that kind of primitive lifestyle maybe should have say no come join be citizen along with the rest of as say many have many have be very successful and be very pleased to meet with talk with at any time and see what grievance be or what feel may be and would be surprised some of become very wealthy because some of those reservation be overlay great pool of oil and can get very rich pumping oil and so do not know what complaint may be soviet dissidents q. mr. president be very much tantalize since yesterday evening by the question why do receive yesterday do receive and when invite yesterday refusenik or dissident and for the second part of the question be just what be impression from soviet people and among these dissident have invite a former collaborator with a fascist who be a policeman serve for fascist president reagan well that be one do not know about or maybe the information have not be all give out on that but have to understand that americans come from every corner of the world receive a letter from a man that call something to attention recently say can go to live in france but can not become a frenchman can go to live in germany can not become a german or a turk or a greek or whatever but say anyone from any corner of the world can come to live in america and become an american have to realize that be a people that be make up of every strain nationality and race of the world and the result be that when people in country think someone be be mistreat or treat unjustly in another country these be people who still feel that kinship to that country because that be heritage in america whenever meet someone new and become friend of the first thing tell each other be what bloodline be for example when be ask have to say irish english and scotch english and scotch on mother 's side irish on father 's side but all of have that well when take on to a wife do not stop love mother so americans all feel a kind of a kinship to that country that parent or grandparent or even some great grandparent come from do not lose that contact so what have come and what have bring to the general secretary — and must say have be very cooperative about have bring list of name that have be bring to from people that be relative or friend that know that or that believe that this individual be be mistreat here in this country and want to be allow to emigrate to country some be separate family that meet in this the|other|day be bear the same time be be bear of russian parent who have move to america oh way back in and be bear in and then sometime later the family move back to russia now be grow have a son be an american citizen but want to go back to america and be deny on the ground that well can go back to america but son marry a russian young lady and want to keep from go back well the whole family say no be not go to leave alone here be a member of the family now well that kind of a case be bring to personally so bring to the general secretary and as say must say have be most helpful and most agreeable about correct these thing now be not blame be blame bureaucracy have the same type of thing happen in own country and every once in a while somebody have to get the bureaucracy by the neck and shake loose and say stop do what be do and this be the type of thing and the name that have bring and be a list of name all of which have be bring to personally by either relative or close friend and associate applause thank very much be all very kind thank very much and hope answer the question correctly nobody ask what be go to feel like to not be president anymore have some understanding because after would be governor for eight|year and then step down want to tell what be like would only be home a|few|day and someone invite out to dinner nancy and both go out get in the back seat of the car and wait for somebody to get in front and drive

pennsylvania town call gettysburg lincoln speak of duty to government of and by the people and never let perish from the earth at the|start|of|this|decade suggest that live in equally momentous time

century and as pray god always will that another generation of americans have protect and pass on lovingly this place call america this shin city on a hill this government of by and for the people thank and god bless view transcript transcript good evening as be speak to now general secretary gorbachev be leave on return trip to the|soviet|union departure mark the end of three|historic|days here in washington in which mr. gorbachev and continue to build a foundation for well relation between government and people during these|three|days take a step only a first step but still a critical toward build a more durable peace indeed a step that may be the most important take since world|war|ii to slow down the arm buildup be refer to the treaty that sign tuesday afternoon in of the|white|house believe this treaty represent a landmark in postwar history because be not just an arm control but an arm reduction agreement unlike treaty of the past this agreement do not simply establish ceiling for new weapon actually reduce the number of such weapon in fact altogether abolish an entire class of u.s. and soviet nuclear missile the verification measure in this treaty be also something new with far reach implication on site inspection and short notice inspection will be permit within the|soviet|union again this be a first time event a breakthrough and that be why believe this treaty will not only lessen the threat of war can also speed along a process that may someday remove that threat entirely indeed this treaty and all that have achieve during this summit signal a broad understanding between the|united|state and the|soviet|union be an understanding that will help keep the peace as work toward the ultimate goal of foreign policy a world where the people of every land can decide for form of government and way of life yet as important as the inf treaty be there be a further and even more crucial point about and the entire summit process soviet american relation be no longer focus only on arm control issue now cover a far broad agenda one that have at root realism and candor let explain this with a saying have often repeat nation do not distrust each other because be armed be armed because distrust each other and just as real peace mean the presence of freedom and justice as well as the absence of war so too summit must be discussion not just about arm but about the fundamental difference that cause nation to be armed deal then with the deep source of conflict between nation and system of government be a practical and moral imperative and that be why be vital to establish a broad summit agenda one that deal not only with arm reduction but also people to people contact between nation and most important the issue of human right and regional conflict this be the summit agenda have adopt by do so have deal not just with arm control issue but also with fundamental problem such as soviet expansionism human right violation as well as own moral opposition to the ideology that justify such practice in this way have put soviet american relation on a far more candid and far more realistic footing also mean that while there be movement indeed dramatic movement in the arm reduction area much remain to be do in that area as well as in these other critical area that have mention especially — and this go without say — in advance goal of a world open to the expansion of human freedom and the growth of democratic government so much work lie ahead let explain on the matter of regional conflict speak candidly with mr. gorbachev on the issue of afghanistan iran iraq cambodia angola and nicaragua continue to have high hope — and assure that do too that can have real cooperation in resolve regional conflict on term that promote peace and freedom this be essential to a lasting improvement in relation so too on human right there be some very limited movement resolution of a number of individual ease in which prisoner will be release or exit visa grant there be assurance of future more substantial movement which hope to see become a reality and finally with regard to the last item on agenda — scientific educational cultural and economic exchange agree to expand cooperation in way that will break down some of the artificial barrier between nation for example agreement be reach to expand and improve civil air service between country but let point out here that while much work be ahead of the progress have make especially in arm reduction do reflect a well understanding between and the soviets also reflect something deep see since first meeting with general secretary gorbachev in have always regard the american people as full participant in discussion though may surprise mr. gorbachev to discover that all this time there have be a third party in the room with do firmly believe the principal credit for the patience and persistence that bring success this year belong to the american people support over these|last|seven|year have lay the basis for these negotiation support make possible for to rebuild military strength to liberate grenada to strike hard against terrorism in libya and more recently to protect strategic interest and bolster friend in the|persian|gulf support make possible policy of help freedom fighter like those in afghanistan nicaragua angola cambodia and other place around the globe and when last|year at reykjavik refuse soviet demand that trade away sdi strategic defense initiative that could erect a space shield against ballistic missile overwhelming support make clear to the soviet leader that the american people prefer no deal to a bad deal and will back president on matter of national security in short support for foreign policy goal build a safe peace as advance the cause of world freedom have help bring the soviets to the bargaining table make possible now to hope for a real fundamental improvement in relation know the question have often be ask whether democratic leader who be accountable to people be not at a grave disadvantage in negotiating with leader of totalitarian|state who bear no such burden well believe think can answer that question can speak from personal experience over the long run no leader at the bargaining table can enjoy any great advantage than the knowledge that have behind a people who be strong and free and alert and resolve to remain that way — people like and be this kind of informed and enlightened support this hide strength of democratic government that enable to do what do this|week at the washington summit now that the treaty be be sign will be submit to the senate for the next step the ratification process will meet with the leadership of congress here tomorrow morning and be confident that the senate will now act in an expeditious way to fulfill duty under constitution to this end let explain the background in the mid- and late-1970 's the soviets begin to deploy hundred of new mobile intermediate range missile capable of destroy major city and military installation in europe and asia this action be an unprovoked new dimension of the threat against friend and ally on both continent a new threat to which the democratic nation have no comparable counter despite intense pressure from the soviets nato proceed with what call a track policy first would deploy a limited number of own inf missile as a deterrent but at the same time push hard in negotiation to do away with this entirely new nuclear threat and set out to do this with a formula first put forward in be call the option mean the complete elimination of these missile on both side well at first many call this a mere propaganda ploy some even here in this country but be persistent ally steadfast and eventually the soviets return to the bargaining table the result be inf treaty as see from the map on the screen now the soviet missile which will be remove and eliminate under the treaty have be a major threat to the security of friend and ally on continent europe and asia under the term of this treaty will be eliminate deploy warhead while the|soviet|union eliminate or time as many now let also point out that this do not however leave nato unprotected in fact will maintain a substantial deterrent force on the ground in the air and at sea commitment to nato 's strategy of be able to respond as necessary to any form of aggression remain steadfast and with regard to verification as have mention have the breakthrough of on site inspection and short notice inspection not only at potential missile deployment site but at the facility where the soviet ss-20 missile and component have be assemble have a verification procedure that assure each side that the missile of the other side have be destroy and that new one be not build here then be a treaty that show how persistence and consistency eventually can pay off in arm negotiation and let assure too that this treaty have be accomplish with unprecedented consultation with ally and friend have speak personally with the leader of the major democracy as have secretary shultz and diplomat this treaty have full allied support but if persistence be pay off in arm reduction effort the question of human right and regional conflict be still problem in relation but be pleased that some progress have be make in these area also now in addition to these candid exchange on part agenda mr. gorbachev and do do some important planning for a moscow summit next|year agree that must redouble effort to reach agreement on reduce the level of u.s. and soviet long range or strategic nuclear arm as have propose in the start negotiation and make real progress toward goal first agree to at geneva to achieve deep 50-percent cut in arsenal of those powerful weapon agree that should build on effort to achieve agreement on a start treaty at the early possible date and have instruct delegation in geneva accordingly now believe deep reduction in these offensive weapon along with the development of sdi would do much to make the world safe for that reason make clear that sdi program will continue and that when have a defense ready to deploy will do so about the future mr. gorbachev and also agree that as nuclear weapon be reduce become all the more important to redress the disparity in conventional and chemical weapon where the soviets now enjoy significant advantage over the|united|state and ally think then from all of this can see not only the direction of soviet american relation but the large framework of american foreign policy as tell the|british|parliament in seek to rid the world of the great nightmare of the postwar era the threat of nuclear war and the threat of totalitarianism and that be why by pursue sdi which be a defense against offensive missile and by go for arm reduction rather than just arm control be move away from the so call policy of mutual assured destruction by which nation hold each other hostage to nuclear terror and destruction so too be say that the postwar policy of containment be no longer enough that the goal of american foreign policy be both world peace and world freedom that as a people hope and will work for a|day when all of god 's child will enjoy the human dignity that creator intend believe gain some ground with regard to that cause in these|last|few|day since first day in office have argue that the future belong not to repressive or totalitarian way of life but to the cause of freedom freedom of the marketplace freedom to speak assemble and vote and when see the progress of democracy in these|last|years from latin|america to asia must be optimistic about the future of child when be together in iceland mr. gorbachev tell that this sort of talk be sometimes view in the|soviet|union as a threat but tell then and have say since then that this be no threat at all but only a dream the american dream and be a dream that have mean so much to so many a dream that still shin out to the world know a|couple|of|years|ago nancy and be deeply move by a story tell by former new|york|times reporter and greek immigrant nicholas|gage be the story of eleni mother a woman catch in of the terrible struggle of the postwar era the greek civil war at the end of world|war|ii a mother who be try and execute because smuggle child out to safety in america be also the story of how son secretly vow to return to greece someday to take vengeance on the man who have send mother to death but at the end of the story nicholas|gage find can not extract the vengeance promise mr. gage write would have relieve the pain that have fill for so|many|year but would also have break the bridge still connect to mother that part of most like as tell and final cry be not a curse on killer but an invocation of what would die for a declaration of love these simple last word of mr. gage 's mother of eleni be child how that cry echo down through the|century a cry for all child of the world a cry for peace for a world of love and understanding and be the hope of heed such word the call for freedom and peace speak by a choose people in a promise land the call speak by the nazar carpenter nazarene carpenter should say stand at the|sea|of|galilee the carpenter whose birth into the poverty of a stable celebrate be these word that remember as the|holiday|season approach and reflect on the event of this|week here in washington so let remember the child and the future want for and let never forget that this promise of peace and freedom the gift that be ours as americans the gift that seek to share with all the world depend for strength on the spiritual source from which come so during this holy season let also reflect that in the prayer of simple people there be more power and might than that possess by all the great statesman or army of the earth let then thank god for all blessing to this nation and ask for help and guidance so that may continue the work of peace and foster the hope of a world where human freedom be enshrine to sum up then this summit be a clear success make progress on each item in part agenda mr. gorbachev and have agree to meet in several|months in moscow to continue what have achieve during these|past|three|day believe there be reason for both hope and optimism & nbsp & nbsp view transcript transcript the president thank all very much welcome to the|white|house this ceremony and the treaty be sign today be both excellent example of the reward of patience be over november that first propose what would come to be call the option be a simple proposal one may say disarmingly simple unlike treaty in the past do not simply codify the status quo or a new arm buildup do not simply talk of control an arm race for the first time in history the language of arm control be replace by arm reduction"—in this case the complete elimination of an entire class of u.s. and soviet nuclear missile of course this require a dramatic shift in thinking and take conventional wisdom some time to catch up reaction to say the least be mixed to some the option be impossibly visionary and unrealistic to other merely a propaganda ploy well with patience determination and commitment have make this impossible vision a reality general secretary gorbachev be sure be familiar with ivan|krylov 's famous tale about the swan the crawfish and the pike seem that once upon a time these be try to move a wagonload together hitch and harness to the wagon be not very heavy but no matter how hard work the wagon just would not move see the swan be fly upward the crawfish keep crawl backward the pike keep make for the water the end result be that get nowhere and the wagon be still there to this day well strong and fundamental moral difference continue to exist between nation but today on this vital issue at least have see what can be accomplish when pull together the number alone demonstrate the value of this agreement on the soviet side over|1,500 deploy warhead will be remove and all ground launch intermediate range missile include the ss-20 's will be destroy on side entire complement of pershing|ii and ground launch cruise missile with deploy warhead will all be destroy additional backup missile on both side will also be destroy but the importance of this treaty transcend number have listen to the wisdom in an

natural right god have grant to all man to all here who have work so hard to make this vision a reality thank and congratulation above all to ambassadors|glitman and obukhov to quote another russian

sweeping overhaul of tax code in nation 's history to all of here today who have work so long and hard to see this day come thank and the thank of a nation go out to the journey be be long and many say would never make to the end but as usual the pessimist leave thing out of calculation the american people have not make this the free country and the mighty economic force on this planet by shrink from challenge never give up and after almost|3|year of commitment and hard work headline in the|washington|post tell the whole story the|impossible|became|the|inevitable and the dream of america 's fair share tax plan become a reality when sign this bill into law america will have the low marginal tax rate and the most modern tax code among major industrialize nation that encourage risk taking innovation and that old american spirit of enterprise will be refuel the american growth economy with the kind of incentive that help create record new business and job in just|46|month fair and simple for most americans this be a tax code design to take into a future of technological invention and economic achievement that will keep america competitive and grow into the|21st|century but for all tax reform 's economic benefit believe that history will record this moment as something more as the return to the first principle this country be found on faith in the individual not group or class but faith in the resource and bounty of each and every separate human soul founding father design a democratic form of government to enlist the individual 's energy and fashioned a|bill|of|right to protect freedom and in so do tap a wellspring of hope and creativity that be to completely transform history the history of these|united|states|of|america be indeed a history of individual achievement be hard work that build city and farm prairie genius that continually push beyond the boundary of exist knowledge reshape world with the steam engine polio vaccine and the silicon chip be faith in freedom and love of country that sustain through trial and hardship and through war and be courage and selflessness that enable to always prevail but when founding father design this government of by and for the people never imagine what have come to know as the progressive income tax when the income tax be first levy in the top rate be only|7|percent on people with income now that be the equivalent of multimillionaire today but in lifetime have see marginal tax rate skyrocket as|high|as|90|percent and not even the poor have be spare as tax rate escalate the tax code grow ever more tangled and complex a haven for special interest and tax manipulator but an impossible frustration for everybody else blatantly unfair tax code become a source of bitterness and discouragement for the average taxpayer be not too much to call un - american meanwhile the steeply progressive nature of the tax strike at the heart of the economic life of the individual punish that special effort and extra hard work that have always be the drive force of economy as government 's hunger for ever more revenue expand family see tax cut or taxis should say cut deep and deep into paycheck and taxation fall most cruelly on the poor make a difficult climb up from poverty even harder throughout history the oppressive hand of government have fall most heavily on the economic life of the individual and more often than not be inflation and taxis that have undermine livelihood and constrain freedom should not forget that this nation of our begin in a revolt against oppressive taxation founding father fight not only for political right but also to secure the economic freedom without which these political freedom be no more than a shadow in the|last|20|year have witness an expansion and strengthening of many of civil liberty but economic liberty have too often be neglect and even abused protect the freedom of expression of the author as should but what of the freedom of expression of the entrepreneur whose pen and paper be capital and profit whose book may be a new invention or small business what of the creator of economic life whose contribution may not only delight the mind but improve the condition of man by feed the poor with new grain bring hope to the sick with new cure vanish ignorance with wondrous new information technology and what about fairness for family be in family that america 's most important work get do raise next generation but over the|last|40|years as inflation have shrink the personal exemption family with child have have to shoulder more and more of the tax burden with inflation and bracket creep also erode income many spouse who would rather stay home with child have be force to go look for job and what of america 's promise of hope and opportunity that with hard work even the poor among can gain the security and happiness that be the due of all americans can not put a price tag on the american dream that dream be the heart and soul of america be the promise that keep nation forever good and generous a model and hope to the world for all these reason this tax bill be less a freedom or a reform should say than a revolution million of work poor will be drop from the tax roll altogether and family will get a long overdue break with low rate and an almost double personal exemption be go to make economical to raise child again flatter rate will mean more reward for that extra effort and vanish loophole and a minimum tax will mean that everybody and every corporation pay fair share and that be why be certain that the bill be sign today be not only an historic overhaul of tax code and a sweeping victory for fairness be also the good antipoverty bill the good profamily measure and the good job creation program ever to come out of the congress of the|united|state and now that have come this far can not and will not allow tax reform to be undo with tax rate hike must restore certainty to tax code and economy and will oppose with all might any attempt to raise tax rate on the american people and hope that all here will join with to make permanent the historic progress of tax reform think all of here today know what a herculean effort take to get this landmark bill to desk that effort do not start here in washington but begin with the many thinker who have struggle to return economic to classical root to an understanding that ultimately the economy be not make up of aggregate like government spending and consumer demand but of individual man and woman each strive to provide for

transcript transcript good evening as most of know have just return from meeting in iceland with the leader of the|soviet|union general secretary gorbachev as do last|year when return from the summit conference in geneva want to take to share with what take place in these discussion the implication of these talk be enormous and only just begin to be understand propose the most sweeping and generous arm control proposal in history offer the complete elimination of all ballistic missile soviet and american — from the face of the earth by while part company with this american offer still on the table be close than ever before to agreement that could lead to a safe world without nuclear weapon but first let tell that from the start of meeting with mr. gorbachev have always regard the american people as full participant believe without support none of these talk could have be hold nor could the ultimate aim of american foreign policy world peace and freedom — be pursue and be for these aim go the extra mile to iceland before report on talk though allow to set the stage by explain thing that be very much a part of talk a treaty and the other a defense against nuclear missile which be try to develop now have hear title a time the abm treaty and sdi well those letter stand for abm antiballistic missile sdi strategic defense initiative some|years|ago the|united|state and the|soviet|union agree to limit any defense against nuclear missile attack to the emplacement in location in each country of a small number of missile capable of intercept and shoot down incoming nuclear missile thus leave real defense a policy call mutual assured destruction mean if side launch a nuclear attack the other side could retaliate and this mutual threat of destruction be believe to be a deterrent against either side strike first so here sit with thousand of nuclear warhead target on each other and capable of wipe out both country the soviets deploy the few antiballistic missile around moscow as the treaty permit country do not bother deploy because the threat of nationwide annihilation make such a limited defense seem useless for some|year now have be aware that the soviets may be develop a nationwide defense have instal a large modern radar at krasnoyarsk which believe be a critical part of a radar system design to provide radar guidance for antiballistic missile protect the entire nation now this be a violation of the abm treaty believe that a policy of mutual destruction and slaughter of citizen and be uncivilized ask military a|few|years|ago to study and see if there be a practical way to destroy nuclear missile after launch but before can reach target rather than to just destroy people well this be the goal for what call sdi and scientist research such a system be convince be practical and that several|year down the road can have such a system ready to deploy now incidentally be not violate the abm treaty which permit such research if and when deploy the treaty — also allow withdrawal from the treaty upon ' notice sdi let make clear be a nonnuclear defense so here be at iceland for second such meeting in the first and in the|month in between have discuss way to reduce and in fact eliminate nuclear weapon entirely and the soviets have have team of negotiator in geneva try to work out a mutual agreement on how could reduce or eliminate nuclear weapon and so far no success on saturday and sunday general secretary gorbachev and foreign minister shevardnadze and secretary of state george|shultz and meet for nearly|10|hour do not limit to just arm reduction discuss what call violation of human right on the part of the soviets refusal to let people emigrate from russia so can practice religion without be persecute let people go to rejoin family husband and wife — separate by national border be allow to reunite in much of this the|soviet|union be violate another agreement the helsinki accord have sign in yuriy|orlov whose freedom just obtain be imprison for point out to government violation of that pact refusal to let citizen leave country or return also discuss regional matter such as afghanistan angola nicaragua and cambodia but by choice the main subject be arm control discuss the emplacement of intermediate range missile in europe and asia and seem to be in agreement could be drastically reduce both side seem willing to find a way to reduce even to the strategic ballistic missile have aim at each other this then bring up the subject of sdi offer a proposal that continue present research and if and when reach the stage of testing would sign now a treaty that would permit soviet observation of such test and if the program be practical would both eliminate offensive missile and then would share the benefit of advanced defense explain that even though would have do away with offensive ballistic missile have the defense would protect against cheating or the possibility of a madman sometime decide to create nuclear missile after all the world now know how to make liken to keep gas mask even though the nation of the world have outlaw poison gas after world|war|i. seem to be make progress on reduce weaponry although the general secretary be register opposition to sdi and propose a pledge to observe abm for a|number|of|year as the|day be end secretary shultz suggest turn over the note note taker have be make of everything would say to respective team and let work through the|night to put together and find just where be in agreement and what difference separate with respect and gratitude can inform those team work through the|night|till yesterday sunday|morning mr. gorbachev and with foreign minister come together again and take up the report of team be most promising the soviets have ask for a 10-year delay in the deployment of sdi program in an effort to see how could satisfy concern while protect principle and security propose a 10-year period in which begin with the reduction of all strategic nuclear arm bomber airlaunched cruise missile intercontinental ballistic missile submarine launch ballistic missile and the weapon carry would be reduce in during the|next|five|years would continue by eliminate all remain offensive ballistic missile of all range and during that time would proceed with research development and testing of sdi all do in conformity with abm provision at the 10-year point with all ballistic missile eliminate could proceed to deploy advanced defense at the same time permit the soviets to do likewise and here the debate begin the general secretary want word that in effect would have keep from develop the sdi for the|entire|10|year in effect be kill sdi and unless agree all that work toward eliminate nuclear weapon would go down the drain — cancel tell have pledge to the american people that would not trade away sdi there be no way could tell people government would not protect against nuclear destruction go to reykjavik determine that everything be negotiable except thing freedom and future be still optimistic that a way will be find the door be open and the opportunity to begin eliminate the nuclear threat be within reach so can see make progress in iceland and will continue to make progress if pursue a prudent deliberate and above all realistic approach with the soviets from of administration this have be policy make clear have no illusion about the soviets or ultimate intention be publicly candid about the critical moral distinction between totalitarianism and democracy declare the principal objective of american foreign policy to be not just the prevention of war but the extension of freedom and stress commitment to the growth of democratic government and democratic institution around the world and that be why assist freedom fighter who be resist the imposition of totalitarian rule in afghanistan nicaragua angola cambodia and elsewhere and finally begin work on what believe most spur the soviets to negotiate seriously rebuild military strength reconstruct strategic deterrence and above all begin work on the strategic defense initiative and yet at the same time set out these foreign policy goal and begin work toward pursue another of major objective that of seek mean to lessen tension with the soviet and way to prevent war and keep the peace now this policy be now pay dividend sign of this in iceland be the progress on the issue of arm control for the first time in a long while soviet american negotiation in the area of arm reduction be move and move in the right direction not just toward arm control but toward arm reduction but for all the progress make on arm reduction must remember there be other issue on the table in iceland issue that be fundamental as mention such issue be human right as president kennedy once say and be not peace in the last analysis basically a matter of human right make plain that the|united|states would not seek to exploit improvement in these matter for purpose of propaganda but also make plain once again that an improvement of the human condition within the|soviet|union be indispensable for an improvement in bilateral relation with the|united|state for a government that will break faith with own people can not be trust to keep faith with foreign power so tell mr. gorbachev — again in reykjavik as have in geneva — americans place far less weight upon the word that be speak at meeting such as these than upon the deed that follow when come to human right and judge soviet intention be all from missouri — get to show another subject area take up in iceland also lie at the heart of the difference between the|soviet|union|and|america this be the issue of regional conflict summit meeting can not make the american people forget what soviet action have mean for the people of afghanistan central|america africa and southeast|asia until soviet policy change will make sure that friend in these area those who fight for freedom and independence — will have the support need finally there be a fourth item and this area be that of bilateral relation people to people contact in geneva last|year welcome several cultural exchange accord in iceland see indication of more movement in these area but let say now the|united|states remain committed to people to people program that could lead to exchange between not just a few elite but thousand of everyday citizen from both country so think then that can see that do make progress in iceland on a broad range of topic reaffirm fourpoint agenda discover major new ground of agreement probe again some old area of disagreement and let return again to the sdi issue realize some americans may be ask tonight why not accept mr. gorbachev 's demand why not give up sdi for this agreement well the answer friend be simple sdi be america 's insurance policy that the|soviet|union would keep the commitment make at reykjavik sdi be america 's security guarantee if the soviets should — as have do too often in the past fail to comply with solemn commitment sdi be what bring the soviets back to arm control talk at geneva and iceland sdi be the key to a world without nuclear weapon the soviets understand this have devote far more resource for a lot long time than to own sdi the world 's only operational missile defense today surround moscow the capital of the|soviet|union what mr. gorbachev be demand at reykjavik be that the|united|state agree to a new version of a 14-year old abm treaty that the|soviet|union have already violate tell do not make those kind of deal in the|united|state and the american people should reflect on these critical question how do a defense of the|united|state threaten the|soviet|union or anyone else why be the soviets so adamant that america remain forever vulnerable to soviet rocket attack as of today all free nation be utterly defenseless against soviet missile fire either by accident or design why do the|soviet|union insist that remain so forever so fellow americans can not promise nor can any president promise that the talk in iceland or any future discussion with mr. gorbachev will lead inevitably to great breakthrough or momentous treaty signing will not abandon the guiding principle take to reykjavik prefer no agreement than to bring home a bad agreement to the|united|state and on this point know be also interested in the question of whether there will be another summit there be no indication by mr. gorbachev as to when or whether plan to travel to the|united|state as agree would last|year in geneva repeat tonight that invitation stand and that continue to believe additional meeting would be useful but that be a decision the soviets must make but whatever the immediate prospect can tell that be ultimately hopeful about the prospect for progress at the summit and for world peace and freedom see the current summit process be very different from that of previous|decades be different because the world be different and the world be different because of the hard work and sacrifice of the american people during the|past|five|and|a|half|year energy have restore and expand economic might support have restore military strength courage and sense of national unity in time of crisis have give pause to adversary hearten friend and inspire the world the western democracy and the nato alliance be revitalize and all across the world nation be turn to democratic idea and the principle of the free market so because the american people stand guard at the|critical|hour freedom have gather force regain strength and be on the march so if there be impression carry away with from these october talk be that unlike the past be deal now from a position of strength and for that reason have within grasp to move speedily with the soviets toward even more breakthrough idea be out there on the table will not go away be ready to pick up where leave off negotiator be head back to geneva and be prepared to go forward whenever and wherever the soviets be ready so there be reason good reason for hope see evidence of this be in the progress make in the talk with mr. gorbachev and see evidence of when leave iceland yesterday and speak to young man and woman at naval installation at keflavik a critically important base far closer to soviet naval basis than to own coastline as always be proud to spend a few moment with and thank for sacrifice and devotion to country represent america at fine commit to defend not only own freedom but the freedom of other who would be live in a far more frightening world be not for the strength and resolve of whenever the standard of freedom and independence have be unfurl there will be america 's heart benediction and prayer john|quincy|adams once

very clear nancy 's personal crusade like that of so many other wonderful individual should become national crusade must include a combination of government and private effort which complement another last|month announce initiative which believe will do just that first seek a drug free workplace at all level of government and in the private sector second will work toward drug free school third want

a threat to national security in october|1 will be meet with key u.s.|ambassador to discuss what can be do to support friend abroad fifth must move to strengthen law enforcement activity such as those initiate by vice president bush and attorney general meese and finally seek to expand public awareness and prevention in order to further implement these goal will announce tomorrow a series of new proposal for a drug free america take as a whole these proposal will toughen law against drug criminal encourage more research and treatment and ensure that illegal drug will not be tolerate in school or in workplace together with ongoing effort these proposal will bring the federal commitment to fight drug to as much financing as commit however would be fool if think that massive new amount of money alone will provide the solution let not forget that in america people solve problem and no national crusade have ever succeed without human investment win the crusade against drug will not be achieve by just throw money at the problem government will continue to act aggressively but nothing would be more effective than for americans simply to quit use illegal drug seek to create a massive change in national attitude which ultimately will separate the drug from the customer to take the user away from the supply believe quite simply that can help quit and that be where come in generation will remember how america swing into action when be attack in world|war|ii the war be not just fight by the fellow fly the plane or drive the tank be fight at home by a mobilized nation — man and

just come from geneva and talk with general secretary gorbachev in the|past|few|day the|past|2|days spend over|15|hour in various meeting with the general secretary and the member of official party and approximately of those hour be talk between mr. gorbachev and just on that be the good part fireside summit there will be know a great deal of commentary and opinion as to what the meeting produce and what be like there be reporter in geneva so be possible there will be opinion on what happen so maybe be the old broadcaster in but decide to file own report directly to meet as have to meet call for a fresh start and make that start can not claim that have a meeting of the mind on such fundamental as ideology or national purpose but understand each other better and that be a key to peace gain a well perspective feel do too be a constructive meeting so constructive in fact that look forward to welcome mr. gorbachev to next|year and have accept invitation to go to moscow the|following|year arrange that out in the parking lot find mr. gorbachev to be an energetic defender of soviet policy be an eloquent speaker and a good listener subject matter be shape by the fact of this|century these|past|40|year have not be an easy time for the west or for the world know the fact there be no need to recite the historical record suffice to say that the|united|states can not afford illusion about the nature of the u.s.s.r. can not assume that ideology and purpose will change this imply endure competition task be to assure that this competition remain peaceful with all that divide can not afford to let confusion complicate thing further must be clear with each other and direct must pay each other the tribute of candor when take the oath of office for the first time begin deal with the|soviet|union in a way that be more realistic than in say the recent past and so in a very real sense preparation for the summit start not months|ago but when with the help of congress begin strengthen economy restore national will and rebuild defense and alliance america be once again strong and strength have give the ability to speak with confidence and see that no true opportunity to advance freedom and peace be lose must not now abandon policy that work need continued support to keep america strong that be the history behind the geneva summit and that be the context in which occur and may add that be especially eager that meeting give a push to important talk already underway on reduce nuclear weapon on this subject would be foolish not to go the extra mile or in this case the extra discuss the great issue of time make clear before the first meeting that no question would be sweep aside no issue bury just because either side find uncomfortable or inconvenient bring these question to the summit and put before mr. gorbachev discuss nuclear arm and how to reduce explain proposal for equitable verifiable and deep reduction outline conviction that proposal would make not just for a world that feel safe but one that really be safe be pleased to report tonight that general secretary gorbachev and do make a measure of progress here have a long way to go but be still head in the right direction move arm control forward from where be last|january when the soviets return to the table be both instruct negotiator to hasten vital work the world be wait for result specifically agree in geneva that each side should move to cut offensive nuclear arm by in appropriate category in joint statement call for early progress on this turn the talk toward chief goal offensive reduction call for an interim accord on intermediate range nuclear force lead hope to the complete elimination of this class of missile and all of this with tough verification also make progress in combating together the spread of nuclear weapon an arm control area in which have cooperate effectively over the|year be also open a dialog on combat the spread and use of chemical weapon while move to ban altogether other arm control dialog in vienna on conventional force and in stockholm on lessen the chance for surprise attack in europe — also receive a boost and finally agree to begin work on risk reduction center a decision that should give special satisfaction to senators|nunn and warner who so ably promote this idea describe strategic defense initiative research effort that envision the possibility of defensive system which could ultimately protect all nation against the danger of nuclear war this discussion produce a very direct exchange of view mr. gorbachev insist that may use a strategic defense system to put offensive weapon into space and establish nuclear superiority make clear that sdi have nothing to do with offensive weapon that instead be investigate nonnuclear defense system that would only threaten offensive missile not people if research succeed will bring much close the safe more stable world that seek nation could defend against missile attack and mankind at long last escape the prison of mutual terror and this be dream so welcome the chance to tell mr. gorbachev that be a nation that defend rather than attack that alliance be defensive not offensive do not seek nuclear superiority do not seek a first strike advantage over the|soviet|union indeed of fundamental arm control objective be to get rid of first strike weapon altogether this be why have propose a 50-percent reduction in the most threatening nuclear weapon especially those that could carry out a first strike go further in express peaceful intention describe proposal in the geneva negotiation for a reciprocal program of open laboratory in strategic defense research be offer to permit soviet expert to see firsthand that sdi do not involve offensive weapon american scientist would be allow to visit comparable facility of the soviet strategic defense program which in fact have involve much more than research for many|years finally reassure mr. gorbachev on another point promise that if research reveal that a defense against nuclear missile be possible would sit down with ally and the|soviet|union to see how together could replace all strategic ballistic missile with such a defense which threaten no one discuss threat to the peace in several region of the world explain proposal for a peace process to stop the war in afghanistan nicaragua ethiopia angola and cambodia those place where insurgency that speak for the people be pit against regime which obviously do not represent the will or the approval of the people try to be very clear about where sympathy lie believe succeed discuss human right americans believe that history teach no clear lesson than this those country which respect the right of own people tend inevitably to respect the right of neighbor human right therefore be not an abstract moral issue be a peace issue finally discuss the barrier to communication between society and elaborate on proposal for real people to people contact on a wide scale americans should know the people of the|soviet|union hope and fear and the fact of life and citizen of the|soviet|union need to know of america 's deep desire for peace and unwavering attachment to freedom as can see talk be wide range and let at this point tell what agree upon and what do not remain far apart on a number of issue as have to be expect however reach agreement on a number of matter and as mention agree to continue meet and this be important and very good there be always room for movement action and progress when people be talk to each other instead of about each other have conclude a new agreement design to bring the good of america 's artist and academic to the|soviet|union the exhibit that will be include in this exchange be of the most effective way for the average soviet citizen to learn about way of life this agreement will also expand the opportunity for americans to experience the soviet people 's rich cultural heritage because artist and academic will be come here have also decide to go forward with a number of people to people initiative that will go beyond great contact not only between the political leader of country but respective student teacher and other as well have emphasize youth exchange and this will help break down stereotype build friendship and frankly provide an alternative to propaganda have agree to establish a new soviet consulate in new|york and a new american consulate in kiev and this will bring a permanent u.s. presence to the ukraine for the first time in decade and have also together with the|government|of|japan conclude a pacific air safety agreement with the|soviet|union this be design to set up cooperative measure to improve civil air safety in that region of the pacific what happen before must never to be allow to happen there again and as a potential way of deal with the energy need of the world of the future have also advocate international cooperation to explore the feasibility of develop fusion energy all of these step be part of a long term effort to build a more stable relationship with the|soviet|union no one ever say could be easy but have come a long way as for soviet expansionism in a number of region of the world while there be little chance of immediate change will continue to support the heroic effort of those who fight for freedom but have also agree to continue and to intensify meeting with the soviets on this and other regional conflict and to work toward political solution know the limit as well as the promise of summit meeting this be after all the 11th summit of the postwar era and still the difference endure but believe continue meeting between the leader of the|united|state and the|soviet|union can help bridge those difference the fact be every new day begin with possibility be up to to fill with the thing that move toward progress and peace hope therefore be a realistic attitude and despair an uninteresting little vice and so be journey worthwhile well when ike president eisenhower have just return from a summit in geneva say the wide gulf that separate so far east and west be wide and deep well today three|decades|later that be still true but yes this meeting be worthwhile for both side a new realism spawn the summit the summit be a good start and now byword must be steady as go be as be impatient for result but good will and good hope do not always yield last result and quick fix do not fix big problem just as must avoid illusion on side so must dispel on the soviet side have make clear to mr. gorbachev that must reduce the mistrust and suspicion between if be to do such thing as reduce arm and this will take deed not word alone and believe be in agreement where do go from here well desire for improved relation be strong be ready and eager for step by step progress know that peace be not just the absence of war do not want a phony peace or a frail peace do not go in pursuit of some kind of illusory detente can not be satisfied with cosmetic improvement that will not stand the test of time want real peace as fly back this|evening have many thought in just|a|few|day family

this bring up the whole question of what presidential leadership be all about think the lesson in central|america this recent embarrassment in nicaragua where be give instruction for hire assassin hire criminal and the rest — all of this have strengthen opponent a president must not only assure that be tough but must also be wise and smart in the exercise of that power see the same thing in lebanon where spend a good deal of america 's asset but because the leadership of this government do not pursue wise policy have be humiliate and opponent be strong the bottom line of national strength be that the president must be in command must lead and when a president do not know that submarine missile be recallable say that of strategic force be conventional discover three|year into administration that arm control effort have fail because do not know that most soviet missile be on land — these be thing a president must know to command a president be call the commander in chief and be call that because be suppose to be in charge of the fact and run government and strengthen nation ms geyer mr. mondale if could broaden the question just a little bit since world|war|ii every conflict that as americans have be involve with have be in nonconventional or irregular term and yet keep fight in conventional or traditional military term the central|american war be very much in the same pattern as china as lebanon as iran as cuba in their|early|days do see any possibility that be go to realize the change in warfare in time or react to in those term mr mondale absolutely must which be why respond to first question the way do be much more complex must understand the region must understand the politic in the area must provide a strong alternative and must show strength and all at the same time that be why object to the covert action in nicaragua that be a classic example of a strategy that be embarrass strengthen opposition and undermine the moral authority of people and country in the region strength require knowledge command have see in the nicaraguan example a policy that have actually hurt strengthen opposition and undermine the moral authority of country in that region ms geyer mr. president in the|last|few|month have seem more and more that policy in be begin to work yet just at this moment be confront with the extraordinary story of a cia guerrilla manual for the anti - sandinista contra whom be back which advocate not only assassination of sandinista but the hiring of criminal to assassinate the guerrilla be support in order to create martyr be this not in effect own state support terrorism president reagan no but be glad ask that question because know be on many people ' mind have order an investigation know that the cia be already go forward with have a gentleman down in nicaragua who be on contract to the cia advise — supposedly on military tactic the contra and draw up this manual be turn over to the agency head of the cia in nicaragua to be print and a number of page be excise by that agency head there the man in charge and send on up here to cia where more page be excise before be print but some way or other there be of the original copy that get out down there and be not submit for this printing process by the cia now those be the detail as have and as soon as have an investigation and find out where any blame lie for the few that do not get excise or change certainly be go to do something about that will take the proper action at the proper time be very interested to hear about central|america and process down there and think for a moment that instead of a debate be go to find mr. mondale in complete agreement with what be do because the plan that have outline be the one have be follow for quite some time include diplomatic process throughout central|america and work closely with the contadora group so can only tell about the manual that be not in the habit of assign guilt before there have be proper evidence produce and proof of that guilt but if guilt be establish whoever be guilty will treat with that situation then and will be remove ms geyer well mr. president be imply then that the cia in nicaragua be direct the contra there would also like to ask whether have the cia investigate own manual in such a sensitive area be not sort of like send the fox into the chicken coop a second time president reagan be afraid misspoke when say a cia head in nicaragua there be not someone there direct all of this activity there be as know cia man station in other country in the world and certainly in central|america and so be a man down there in that area that this be deliver to and recognize that what be in that manual be in direct contravention of own executive order in december|of|1981 that would have nothing to do with regard to political assassination mr newman mr. mondale rebuttal mr mondale what be a president charge with do when take oath of office raise right hand and take an oath of office to take care to faithfully execute the law of the land a president can not know everything but a president have to know those thing that be essential to leadership and the enforcement of law this manual several|thousand of which be produce be distribute order political assassination hire of criminal and other form of terrorism some of be excise but the part deal with political terrorism be continue how can this happen how can something this serious occur in an administration and have a president of the|united|state in a situation like this say do not know a president must know these thing do not know which be bad not know or know and not stop and what about the mining of the harbor in nicaragua which violate international law this have hurt this country and a president 's suppose to command mr newman mr. president rebuttal president reagan yes have so many thing there to respond to be go to pick out something say earlier have be all over the country repeat something that will admit the press have also be repeat that believe that nuclear missile could be fire and then call back never ever conceive of such a thing never say any such thing in a discussion of strategic arm negotiation say that submarine carry missile and airplane carry missile be more conventional type weapon not as destabilizing as the land base missile and that be also weapon that or carrier that if be send out and there be a change could call back before have launch missile but hope that from here on will no longer be say that particular thing which be absolutely false how anyone could think that any sane person would believe could call back a nuclear missile think be as ridiculous as the whole concept have be so thank for give a chance to straighten the record be sure that appreciate that laughter mr newman mr. kalb question to president reagan & nbsp soviet union mr kalb mr. president have often describe the|soviet|union as a powerful evil empire intent on world domination but this|year have say and quote if want to keep mickey|mouse system that be okay with which be mr. president do want to contain within present border and perhaps try to reestablish detente or what go for detente or do really want to roll back empire president reagan have say on a number of occasion exactly what believe about the|soviet|union retract nothing that have say believe that many of the thing have do be evil in any concept of morality that have but also recognize that as the great superpower in the world have to live with each other and tell mr. gromyko do not like system do not like ours and be not go to change system and sure better not try to change ours but between can either destroy the world or can save and suggest that certainly be to common interest along with to avoid a conflict and to attempt to save the world and remove the nuclear weapon and think that perhaps establish a little well understanding think that in deal with the|soviet|union have to be realistic know that mr. mondale in the past have make statement as if be just people like and if be kind and good and do something nice would respond accordingly and the result be unilateral disarmament cancel the b-1 under the previous administration what do get for nothing the|soviet|union have be engage in the big military buildup in the history of man at the same time that try the policy of unilateral disarmament of weakness if will and now be put up a defense of own and have make very plain to seek no superiority simply be go to provide a deterrent so that will be too costly for if be nurse any idea of aggression against now claim be not and make plain to be not there be be no change in attitude at all just think when come into office be time that there be some realistic talk to and about the|soviet|union and do get attention & nbsp regions vital to u.s. interest mr kalb mr. president perhaps the other side of the coin a related question sir since world|war|ii the vital interest of the|united|state have always be define by treaty commitment and by presidential proclamation aside from what be obvious such as nato for example which country which region in the world do regard as vital national interest of this country mean that would send american troop to fight there if be in danger president reagan ah well now have add a hypothetical there at the end mr. kalb about where would send troop in to fight be not go to make the decision as to what the tactic could be but obviously there be a number of area in the world that be of importance to be the|middle|east and that be of interest to the whole western|world and the industrialize nation because of the great supply of energy upon which so many depend there neighbor here in america be vital to be work right now in try to be of help in southern africa with regard to the independence of namibia and the removal of the cuban surrogate the thousand of from angola so can say there be a great many interest believe that have a great interest in that be where think the future of the world lie but be not go to pick out and in advance hypothetically say oh yes would send troop there do not want to send troop any place mr newman be sorry mr. president sir time be up president reagan all right & nbsp soviet union mr kalb mr. mondale have describe the soviet leader as and be quote cynical ruthless and dangerous suggest an almost total lack of trust in in that case what make think that the annual summit meeting with that have propose will result in agreement that would satisfy the interest of this country mr mondale because the only type of agreement to reach with the|soviet|union be the type that be specifically define so know exactly what must do subject to full verification which mean know every day whether be live up to and follow up wherever find suggestion that be violate and the strong possible term have no illusion about the soviet|union leadership or the nature of that state be a tough and a ruthless adversary and must be prepared to meet that challenge and would where part with the president be that despite all of those difference must as past president before this have do meet on the common ground of survival and that be where the president have oppose practically every arm control agreement by every president of both political party since the bomb go off and now complete this term with no progress toward arm control at all but with a very dangerous arm race underway instead there be now over|2,000 more warhead point at today than there be when be swear in and that do not strengthen must be very very realistic in the nature of that leadership but must grind away and talk to find way of reduce these difference particularly where arm race be concerned and other dangerous exercise of soviet power there will be no unilateral disarmament under administration will keep this nation strong understand exactly what the soviets be up to but that too be a part of national strength to do that a president must know what be essential to command and to leadership and to strength and that be where the president 's failure to master in opinion the essential element of arm control have cost dearly be three|year into this administration say just discover that most soviet missile be on land and that be why proposal do not work invite the american people tomorrow because will issue the statement quote president reagan say exactly what say say say that these missile be less dangerous than ballistic missile because could fire and could recall if decide there have be a miscalculation mr newman be sorry sir— mr mondale a president must know those thing & nbsp eastern europe mr kalb a related question mr. mondale on do accept the conventional diplomatic wisdom that eastern|europe be a soviet sphere of influence and if do what could a mondale administration realistically do to help the people of achieve the human right that be guarantee to as a result of the helsinki accord mr mondale think the essential strategy of the|united|state ought not accept any soviet control over ought to deal with each of these country separately ought to pursue strategy with each of economic and the rest that help pull away from dependence upon the|soviet|union where the|soviet|union have act irresponsibly as have in many of those country especially recently in poland believe ought to insist that western credit extend to the|soviet|union bear the market rate make the soviets pay for irresponsibility that be a very important objective to make certain that continue to look forward to progress toward great independence by these nation and work with each of separately mr newman mr. president rebuttal president reagan yes be not go to continue try to respond to these repetition of the falsehood that have already be state here but with regard to whether mr. mondale would be strong as say would be know that have a commercial out where be appear on the deck of the nimitz and watch the f-14s take off and that be an image of strength except that if have have way when the nimitz be be plan would have be deep in the water out there because there would not have be any nimitz to stand on be against laughter be against the f-14 fighter be against the m-1 tank be against the bi bomber want to cut the salary of all of the military want to bring home half of the american force in europe and have a record of weakness with regard to national defense that be second to none audience member hear hear president reagan indeed be on that side virtually throughout all year in the senate and oppose even president carter when toward the end of term president carter want to increase the defense budget mr newman mr. mondale rebuttal mr mondale mr. president accept commitment to peace but want to accept commitment to a strong national defense applause propose a budget have propose a budget which would increase nation 's strength in real term by double that of the|soviet|union will tell where disagree be true over vote to delay production of the f-14 and will tell why the plane be not fly the way be suppose to be be a waste of money definition of national strength be to throw money at the|defense|department definition of national strength be to make certain that a dollar spend buy a dollar 's worth of defense there be a big difference between the of a president must manage that budget will keep strong but will not do that unless command that budget and make certain get the strength that need pay for a hammer be not buy strength mr newman would ask the audience not to applaud all do be take up time that would like to devote to the debate mr. kondracke question to mr. mondale & nbsp use of military force mr kondracke mr. mondale in an address earlier|this|year say that before this country resort to military force and be quote american interest should be sharply define publicly support congressionally sanction militarily feasible internationally defensible open to independent scrutiny and alert to regional history now be not set up such a gauntlet of test here that adversary could easily suspect that as president would never use force to protect american interest mr mondale no as a matter of fact believe every of those standard be essential to the exercise of power by this country and can see that in both lebanon and in central|america in lebanon this president exercise american power all right but the management of be such that marine be kill have to leave in humiliation the|soviet|union become strong terrorist become emboldened and be because do not think through how power should be exercise do not have the american public with on a plan that work that end up the way do similarly in central|america what be do in nicaragua with this covert war which the congress include many republicans have try to stop be finally end up with a public definition of american power that hurt where get associate with political assassin and the rest have to decline for the first time in modern history jurisdiction in the|world|court because will find guilty of illegal action and enemy be strengthen from all of this need to be strong need to be prepared to use that strength but must understand that be a democracy be a government by the people and when move should be for very severe and extreme reason that serve national interest and end up with a strong country behind be only in that way that can persevere & nbsp nicaragua mr kondracke have be quote as say that may quarantine nicaragua would like to know what that mean would stop soviet ship as president kennedy do in and would not that be more dangerous than president reagan 's covert war mr mondale what be refer to there be the mutual self defense provision that exist in the inter - american treaty the so call rio|pact that permit the nation friend in that region to combine to take step diplomatic and otherwise to prevent nicaragua when act irresponsibly in assert power in other part outside of border to take those step whatever may be to stop the nicaraguans must know that be the policy of government that that leadership must stay behind the boundary of nation not interfere in other nation and by work with all of the nation in the region unlike the policy of this administration and unlike the president say have not support negotiation in that region will be much strong because will have the moral authority that go with those effort & nbsp lebanon mr kondracke president reagan introduce u.s. force into lebanon as neutral peacekeeper but then make combatant on the side of the lebanese government eventually be force to withdraw under fire and now syria a soviet ally be dominant in the country do not lebanon represent a major failure on the part of administration and raise serious question about capacity as a foreign policy strategist and as commander in chief president reagan no morton do not agree to all of those thing first of all when and ally the italians the french and the united|kingdom — go into lebanon go in there at the request of what be leave of the lebanese government to be a stabilize force while try to establish a government but the first pardon the first time go in go in at request because the war be go on right in beirut between israel and the plo terrorist israel could not be blame for that those terrorist have be violate northern border consistently and israel chase all the way to there then go in with the multinational force to help remove and do remove of those terrorist from lebanon depart and then the government of lebanon ask back in as a stabilize force while establish a government and seek to get the foreign force all the way out of lebanon and that could then take care of own border and be succeed be there for the well part of a|year position happen to be at the airport oh there be occasional sniping and sometimes some artillery fire but do not engage in conflict that be out of line with mission will never send troop anywhere on a mission of that kind without tell that if somebody shoot at can darn well shoot back and this be what do never initiate any kind of action defend there but be succeed to the point that the lebanese government have be organize if will remember there be the meeting in geneva in which begin to meet with the hostile factional force and try to put together some kind of a peace plan be succeed and that be why the terrorist act begin there be force there and that include syria in mind who do not want to succeed who do not want that kind of a peace with a dominant lebanon dominant over own territory and so the terrorist act begin and lead to the great tragedy when be kill in that suicide bombing of the building then the multilateral force withdraw for only|one reason withdraw because be no longer able to carry out the mission for which have be send in but go in in the interest of peace and to keep israel and syria from get into the sixth war between and have no apology for go on a peace mission mr kondracke mr. president four|years|ago criticize president carter for ignore ample warning that diplomat in iran may be take hostage have not do exactly the same thing in lebanon not once but time with americans not hostage but dead and vow swift retaliation against terrorist but do not lack of response suggest that be just bluff president reagan morton no think there be a great difference between the government of iran threaten diplomatic personnel and there be a government that can see and can put hand on in the terrorist situation there be terrorist faction all over in a recent period terrorist act in country have be commit the most recent have be the in brighton in deal with terrorist yes want to retaliate but only if can put finger on the people responsible and not endanger the life of innocent civilian there in the various community and in the city of beirut where these terrorist be operate have just sign legislation to add to ability to deal along with ally with this terrorist problem and be go to take all the nation together just as when band together pretty much resolve the whole problem of skyjacking sometime ago well the red light go on could have go on forever mr newman mr. mondale rebuttal mr mondale groucho|marx say who do believe?—me or own eye and what have in lebanon be something that the american people have see the|joint|chiefs urge the president not to put troop in that barracks because be indefensible go to five|day before be kill and say please take out of there the secretary of state admit that this|morning do not do so the report follow the explosion of the barrack disclose that have not take any of the step that should have take that be the second time then the embassy be blow up a|few|weeks|ago and once again none of the step that should have be take be take and be warn five|day before that explosive be on way and be not take the terrorist have win each time the president tell the terrorist be go to retaliate do not call bluff and the bottom line be that the|united|state leave in humiliation and enemy be strong mr newman mr. president rebuttal president reagan yes first of all mr. mondale should know that the president of the|united|state do not order the marine into that barracks that be a command decision make by the commander on the spot and base with what think be good for the man there that be on the other thing that have just say about the terrorist be tempt to ask what would do these be unidentified people and after the bomb go off be blow to bit because be suicidal individual who think be go to go to paradise if perpetrate such an act and lose life in do be go to as say be busy try to find the center where these operation stem from and retaliation will be take but be not go to simply kill some people to say oh look get even want to know when retaliate that be retaliate with those who be responsible for the terrorist act and terrorist act be such that own united|states capitol in washington have be bomb twice mr newman mr. trewhitt question to president reagan & nbsp the president 's age mr trewhitt mr. president want to raise an issue that think have be lurk out there for two|or|three|weeks and cast specifically in national security term already be the old president in history and some of staff say be tired after most recent encounter with mr. mondale recall yet that president kennedy have to go for day on end with very little sleep during the cuban missile crisis be there any doubt in mind that would be able to function in such circumstance president reagan not at all mr. trewhitt and want to know that also will not make age an issue of this campaign be not go to exploit for political purpose opponent 's youth and inexperience laughter and applause if still have time may add mr. trewhitt may add that be seneca or be cicero do not know which that say if be not for the elder correct the mistake of the young there would be no state & nbsp strategic missiles mr trewhitt mr. president would like to head for the fence and try to catch that before go over but will go on to another question and mr. mondale have already disagree about what have to say about recall submarine launch missile there be another a similar issue out there that relate to — be say at least that be unaware that the soviet retaliatory power be base on land base missile first be that correct secondly if be correct have inform in the meantime and third be even necessary for the president to be so intimately involve in strategic detail president reagan yes this have to do with disarmament talk and the whole controversy about land missile come up because think that the strategic nuclear weapon the most destabilizing be the land base put thumb on a button and somebody blow up so think that would be simple to negotiate first with those and then make plain a second phase take up the submarine launch or the airborne missile the|soviet|union to surprise — and not just make plain when bring this up that place think a great reliance on the landbased missile and therefore want to take up all and agree say all right if that be what want to do but be a surprise to because outnumber 64|to|36 in submarine and more bomber capable of carry nuclear missile than have so why should believe that have place that much more reliance on landbase but even after give in and say all right let discuss all walk away from the table do not & nbsp the president 's age mr trewhitt mr. mondale be go to hang in there should the president 's age and stamina be an issue in the political campaign mr mondale no and have not make an issue nor should be what be at issue here be the president 's application of authority to understand what a president must know to lead this nation secure defense and make the decision and the judgment that be necessary a|minute|ago the president quote cicero believe want to quote somebody a little close to home harry|truman say the buck stop here just hear the president 's answer for the problem at the barrack in lebanon where marine be kill what happen first the|joint|chiefs|of|staff go to the president say do not put those troop there do and then five|day before the troop be kill go back to the president through the secretary of defense and say please mr. president take those troop out of there because can not defend do not do and know what happen after that once again embassy be explode this be the fourth time this have happen an identical attack in the same region despite warning even public warning from the terrorist who be in charge who be handle this matter that be main point now on arm control be complete four|years this be the first administration since the bomb go off that make no progress have an arm race underway instead a president have to lead government or will not be do different people with different view fight with each other for three|and|a|half|year this administration avoid arm control resist table arm control proposal that have any hope of agreeing rebuke negotiator in when come close to an agreement at least in principle on medium range weapon and have this arm race underway and a recent book that just come out by perhaps the nation 's most respected author in this field strobe|talbott call deadly|gambits conclude that this president have fail to master the essential detail need to command and lead both in term of security and term of arm control that be why call the president the commander in chief good intention grant but take more than that must be tough and smart & nbsp the president 's leadership mr trewhitt this question of leadership keep arise in different form in this discussion already and the president mr. mondale have call whine and vacillate among the more charitable phrase weak believe be a question of leadership and have make the point that have not repudiate some of the semidiplomatic activity of the reverend jackson particularly in central|america do approve of diplomatic activity and be prepared to repudiate now mr mondale read statement the|other|day do not admire fidel|castro at all and have say that che|guevara be a contemptible figure in civilization 's history know the cuban state as a police state and all life have work in a way that demonstrate that but jesse|jackson be an independent person do not control and let talk about people do control in the last debate,1 the vice president of the|united|state say that say the marine have die shamefully and die in shame in lebanon demand an apology from vice president bush because have instead honor these young man grieve for family and think be wonderful americans that honor all what do the president have to say about take responsibility for a vice president who will not apologize for something like that mr. mondale be refer to an early debate between george|bush and geraldine|ferarro the vice presidential candidate mr newman mr. president rebuttal president reagan yes know will come as a surprise to mr. mondale but be in charge and as a matter of fact have not avoid arm control talk with the|soviet|union very early in administration propose and think something that have never be propose by any previous administration propose a total elimination of intermediate range missile where the soviets have well than a 10—and still have — well than a advantage over the ally in europe when protest that and suggest a small number perhaps go along with that the so call negotiation that say walk out on be the so call walk in the wood between of representative and of the|soviet|union and be not that turn down the|soviet|union disavow mr newman mr. mondale rebuttal mr mondale there be distinguished author on arm control in this country there be many other but that want to cite tonight be strobe|talbott in classic book the other be john|neuhaus who be of the most distinguished arm control specialist in country both say that this administration turn down the walk in the wood agreement first and that would have be a perfect agreement from the standpoint of the|united|state in europe and security when mr. nitze a good negotiator return be rebuke and boss be fire this be the kind of leadership that have have in this administration on the most deadly issue of time now have a runaway arm race all have get to show for four|years in u.s.-soviet relation be meeting in the|last|weeks of an administration and nothing before be tough negotiator but all previous president have make progress this one have not mr newman ms. geyer question to mr. mondale & nbsp illegal immigration ms geyer mr. mondale many analyst be now say that actually number foreign policy problem today be that remain almost totally unrecognized massive illegal immigration from economically collapse country be say that be the only real territorial threat to the american nation state say in the|1970s that have a hemorrhage on border yet today have back off any immigration reform such as the balanced and highly craft simpson mazzoli bill why what would do instead today if anything mr mondale this be a very serious problem in country and have to be deal with object to that part of the simpson mazzoli bill which think be very unfair and would prove to be so that be the part that require employer to determine the citizenship of an employee before be hire be convinced that the result of this would be that people who be hispanic people who have different language or speak with an accent would find difficult to be employ think that be wrong have never have citizenship test in country before and do not think should have a citizenship card today that be counterproductive do support the other aspect of the simpson mazzoli bill that strengthen enforcement at the border strengthen other way of deal with undocumented worker in this difficult area and deal with the problem of settle people who have live here for many many|years and do not have an establish status have further strongly recommend that this administration do something have not do and that be to strengthen enforcement at the border strengthen the official in this government that deal with undocumented worker and to do so in a way that be responsible and within the|united|state need an answer to this problem but must be an american answer that be consistent with justice and due process everyone in this room practically here tonight be an immigrant come here love this nation serve and have serve all of most bountiful dream and of those dream be justice and need a measure and will support a measure — that bring about those objective but avoid that aspect that think be very serious the second part be to maintain and improve relation with friend to the south can not solve this problem all on own and that be why the failure of this administration to deal in an effective and a good faith way with mexico with costa|rica with the other nation in try to find a peaceful settlement to the dispute in central|america have undermine capacity to effectively deal diplomatically in this area as well ms geyer sir people as well balance and just as father theodore|hesburgh at notre|dame who head the select commission on immigration have point out repeatedly that there will be no immigration reform without employer sanction because would be an unbalanced bill and there would be simply no way to enforce however put that aside for the moment critic have also say repeatedly that have not go along with the bill or with any immigration reform because of the hispanic group or hispanic leadership group who actually do not represent what the hispanic americans want because poll show that overwhelmingly want some kind of immigration reform can say or how can justify position on this and how do respond to the criticism that this be another or that this be an example of flip flop and give in to special interest group at the expense of the american nation mr mondale think be right that the poll show that the majority of hispanics want that bill so be not do for political reason be do because all life have fight for a system of justice in this country a system in which every american have a chance to achieve the fullness in life without discrimination this bill impose upon employer the responsibility of determine whether somebody who apply for a job be an american or not and just inevitably be go to be reluctant to hire hispanics or people with a different accent if be deal with politic here the poll show the american people want this be for reform in this area for tough enforcement at the border and for many other aspect of the simpson mazzoli bill but all life have fight for a fair nation and despite the politic of stand where stand and think be right and before this fight be over be go to come up with a well bill a more effective bill that do not undermine the liberty of people ms geyer mr. president too have say that border be out of control yet this fall allow the simpson mazzoli bill which would at least have minimally protect border and the right of citizenship because of a relatively unimportant issue of reimbursement to the state for legalized alien give that may ask what priority can expect to give this forget national security element how sincere be in effort to control in effect the nation state that be the|united|state president reagan georgie|anne believe support the simpson mazzoli bill strongly and the bill that come out of the senate however there be thing add in in the house side that feel make less of a good bill as a matter of fact make a bad bill and in conference — stay with in conference all the way to where even senator simpson do not want the bill in the manner in which would come out of the conference committee there be a number of thing in there that weaken that bill can not go into detail about here but be true border be out of control be also true that this have be a situation on border back through a number of administration and support this bill believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down root and who have live here even though sometime back may have enter illegally with regard to the employer sanction must have that not only to ensure that can identify the illegal alien but also while some keep protest about what would do to employer there be another employer that should not be so concerned about and these be employer down through the|year who have encourage the illegal entry into this country because then hire these individual and hire at starvation wage and with none of the benefit that think be normal and natural for worker in country and the individual can not complain because of illegal status do not think that those people should be allow to continue operate free and this be why the provision that have in with regard to sanction and so forth and be go to do everything can and all of in the administration be to join in again when congress be back at to get an immigration bill that will give once again control of border and with regard to friendship below the border and with the country down there yes no administration that know have establish the relationship that have with latin friend but as long as have an economy that leave so many people in dire poverty and unemployment be go to seek that employment across border and work with those other country ms geyer mr. president the expert also say that the situation today be terribly different quantitatively qualitatively different from what have be in the past because of the gigantic population growth for instance mexico 's population will go from about|60|million today to at many of these people will be come into the|united|state not as citizen but as illegal worker have repeatedly say recently that believe that armageddon the destruction of the world may be imminent in time do ever feel that be in for an armageddon or a situation a time of anarchy regard the population explosion in the world president reagan no as a matter of fact the population explosion if look at the actual figure have be vastly exaggerate — over exaggerate as a matter of fact there be some pretty scientific and solid figure about how much space there still be in the world and how many more people can have be almost like go back to the malthusian theory when even then be say that everyone would starve with the limited population have then but the problem of population growth be here with regard to immigration and have be the safety valve whether want to or not with the illegal entry here in mexico where population be increase and do not have an economy that can absorb and provide the job and this be what be try to work out not only to protect own border but to have some kind of fairness and recognition of that problem mr newman mr. mondale rebuttal mr mondale of the big problem today be that the country to south be so desperately poor that these people who will almost lose life if do not come north come north despite all the risk and if be go to find a permanent fundamental answer to this go to american economic and trade policy that permit these nation to have a chance to get on own two|feet and to get prosperity so that can have job for and people and that be why this enormous national debt engineer by this administration be harm these country in fuel this immigration these high interest rate real rate that have double under this administration have have the same effect on mexico and so on and the cost of repay those debt be so enormous that result in massive unemployment hardship and heartache and that drive friend to the south up into region and need to end those deficit as well mr newman mr. president rebuttal president reagan well rebuttal be have hear the national debt blame for a lot of thing but not for illegal immigration across border— laughter —and have nothing to do with but with regard to these high interest rate too at least give the recognition of the fact that when leave office mr. mondale be 1/2—the prime rate be now and predict will be come down a little more shortly so be try to undo some of the thing that administration do applause mr newman no applause please mr. kalb question to president reagan & nbsp armageddon mr kalb mr. president would like to pick up this armageddon theme have be quote as say that do believe deep down that be head for some kind of biblical armageddon pentagon and secretary of defense have plan for the|united|state to fight and prevail in a nuclear war do feel that be now head perhaps for some kind of nuclear armageddon and do feel that this country and the world could survive that kind of calamity president reagan mr. kalb think what have be hail as something be supposedly as president discuss as principle be the recall of just some philosophical discussion with people who be interested in the same thing and that be the prophecy down through the|year the biblical prophecy of what would portend the coming of armageddon and so forth and the fact that a number of theologian for the|last|decade or more have believe that this be true that the prophecy be come together that portend that but no one know whether armageddon those prophecy mean that armageddon be a|thousand|years away or day after tomorrow so have never seriously warn and say must plan accord to armageddon now with regard to have to say whether would try to survive in the event of a nuclear war of course would but let also point out that to several parliament around the world in europe and in asia have make a statement to each of and will repeat here a nuclear war can not be win and must never be fight and that be why be maintain a deterrent and try to achieve a deterrent capacity to where no one would believe that could start such a war and escape with limited damage but the deterrent and that be what be for — be also what lead to propose what be now be call the star wars concept but propose that research to see if there be not a defensive weapon that could defend against incoming missile and if such a defense could be find would not be far more humanitarian to say that now can defend against a nuclear war by destroy missile instead of slaughter million of people & nbsp strategic defense initiative mr kalb mr. president when make that proposal the so call star wars proposal say if be not mistaken that would share this very super - sophisticated technology with the|soviet|union after all of the distrust over the|year sir that have express towards the|soviet|union do really expect anyone to take seriously that offer that would share the good of america 's technology in this weapon area with principal adversary president reagan why not what if do and hope can be still research what if come up with a weapon that render those missile obsolete there have never be a weapon invent in the history of man that have not lead to a defensive a counter - weapon but suppose come up with that now some people have say ah that would make war imminent because would think that could launch a first strike because could defend against the enemy but why not do what have offer to do and ask the|soviet|union to do say look here be what can do will even give to now will sit down with and once and for all get rid all of of these nuclear weapon and free mankind from that threat think that would be the great use of a defensive weapon mr kalb mr. mondale have be very sharply critical of the president 's strategic defense initiative and yet what be wrong with a major effort by this country to try to use good technology to knock out as many incoming nuclear warhead as possible mr mondale first of all let sharply disagree with the president on share the most advanced the most dangerous the most important technology in america with the|soviet|union have have for many|years understandably a system of restraint on high technology because the soviets be behind and any research or development along the star wars scheme would inevitably involve most advanced computer most advanced engineering and the thought that would share this with the|soviet|union be in opinion a total non - starter would not let the|soviet|union get hand on at all now what be wrong with star wars there be nothing wrong with the theory of if could develop a principle that would say both side could fire all missile and no one would get hurt suppose be a good idea but the fact of be be so far away from research that even come close to that that the|director|of|engineering|research at say to get there would have to solve problem each of which be more difficult than the atomic bomb and the manhattan project would cost something like to test and deploy weapon the second thing be this all assume that the soviets would not respond in kind and always do do not get behind will not get behind and that be be the tragic story of the arm race have more at stake in space satellite than do if could stop right now the testing and the deployment of these space weapon and the president 's proposal go clear beyond research if be just research would not have any argument because maybe someday somebody will think of something but to commit this nation to a buildup of antisatellite and space weapon at this time in crude state would bring about an arm race that be very dangerous indeed final point the most dangerous aspect of this proposal be for the first time would delegate to computer the decision as to whether to start a war that be dead wrong there would not be time for a president to decide would be decide by these remote computer may be an oil fire may be a jet exhaust the computer may decide be a missile and off go why do not stop this madness now and draw a line and keep the heaven free from war applause & nbsp nuclear freeze mr kalb mr. mondale in this general area sir of arm control president carter 's national security adviser zbigniew|brzezinski say a nuclear freeze be a hoax yet the basis of arm proposal as understand be a mutual and verifiable freeze on exist weapon system in view which specific weapon system could be subject to a mutual and verifiable freeze and which could not mr mondale every system that be verifiable should be place on the table for negotiation for an agreement would not agree to any negotiation or any agreement that involve conduct on the part of the|soviet|union that could not verify every|day would not agree to any agreement in which the united|states security interest be not fully recognize and support that be why say mutual and verifiable freeze now why do support the freeze because this ever rise arm race madness make both nation less secure be more difficult to defend this nation be put a hair trigger on nuclear war this administration by go into the star|war system be go to add a dangerous new escalation have to be tough on the|soviet|union but think the american people— mr newman time be up mr. mondale mr mondale —and the people of the|soviet|union want to stop mr newman president reagan rebuttal president reagan yes rebuttal once again be that this invention that have just be create here of how would go about roll over for the|soviet|union no mr. mondale idea would be with that defensive weapon that would sit down with and then say now be willing to join here be what we"—give a demonstration and then say—"here be what can do now if be willing to join in get rid of all the nuclear weapon in the world then will give this one so that would both know that no one can cheat that be both get something that if anyone try to cheat but when keep star war never suggest where the weapon should be or what kind be not a scientist say and the|joint|chiefs|of|staff agree with that be time for to turn research ability to see if could not find this kind of defensive weapon and suddenly somebody say oh be get to be up there and be star wars and so forth do not know what would be but if can come up with think the world will be well off mr newman mr. mondale rebuttal mr mondale well that be what a president 's suppose to know where those weapon be go to be if be space weapon assume will be in space laughter if be antisatellite weapon assume be go to be aim against satellite now this be the most dangerous technology that possess the soviets try to spy on steal this stuff and to give technology of this kind disagree with have not just accept research mr. president have set up a strategic defense initiative an agency be begin to test be talk about deploy be ask for a budget of some|$30|billion for this purpose this be an arm escalation and will be well off far better off if stop right now because have more to lose in space then do if someday somebody come along with an answer that be something else but that there would be an answer in lifetime be unimaginable why do start thing that know the soviets will match and make all less secure that be what a president 's for mr newman mr. kondracke question to mr. mondale & nbsp strategic weapon mr kondracke mr. mondale say that with respect to the|soviet|union want to negotiate a mutual nuclear freeze yet would unilaterally give up the mx missile and the b-1 bomber before the talk have even begin and have announce in advance that reach an agreement with the soviets be the most important thing in the world to now be not give away half the store before even sit down to talk mr mondale no as a matter of fact have a vast range of technology and weaponry right now that provide all the bargaining chip that need and support the air launch cruise missile the ground launch cruise missile the pershing missile the trident submarine the d-5 submarine stealth technology the midgetman — have a whole range of technology why disagree with the mx be that be a sit duck will draw an attack put a hair trigger and be a dangerous destabilizing weapon and the b-1 be similarly to be oppose because for the|soviet|union have be prepare to meet the b-1 the secretary of defense say would be a suicide mission if be build instead want to build the midgetman which be mobile and thus less vulnerable contribute to stability and a weapon that will give security and contribute to an incentive for arm control that be why be for stealth technology to build a stealth bomber which have support for year that can penetrate the soviet air defense system without any hope that can perceive where be because radar system be frustrated in other word a president have to make choice this make strong the final point be that can use this money that save on these weapon to spend on thing that really need conventional strength in europe be under strength need to strengthen that in order to assure western ally of presence there a strong defense but also to diminish and reduce the likelihood of a commencement of a war and the use of nuclear weapon be in this way by make wise choice that be strong enhance the chance of arm control every president until this one have be able to do and this nation or the world be more dangerous as a result & nbsp nuclear freeze mr kondracke want to follow up on mr. kalb 's question seem to on the question of verifiability that do have some problem with the extent of the freeze seem to for example that testing would be very difficult to verify because the soviets encode telemetry research would be impossible to verify number of warhead would be impossible to verify by satellite except for with on site inspection and production of any weapon would be impossible to verify now in view of that what be go to be freeze mr mondale will not agree to any arm control agreement include a freeze that be not verifiable let take warhead principle the warhead principle — there have be count rule for year whenever a weapon be test count the number of warhead on and whenever that warhead be use count that number of warhead whether have that number or less on or not these be standard rule will not agree to any production restriction or agreement unless have the ability to verify those agreement do not trust the russians believe that every agreement reach must be verifiable and will not agree to anything that can not tell every day in other word have get to be tough but in order to stop this arm madness have get to push ahead with tough negotiation that be verifiable so that know the soviets be agree and live up to agreement & nbsp support for u.s. ally mr kondracke mr. president want to ask a question about negotiate with friend severely criticize president carter for help to undermine friendly dictator who get into trouble with own people the shah of iran and president somoza of nicaragua now there be other such leader head for trouble include president pinochet of chile and president marcos of the philippines what should do and what can do to prevent the philippines from become another nicaragua president pinochet morton do criticize the president because of undercutting of what be a stalwart ally the shah of iran and be not at all convince that be that far out of line with people or that want that to happen the shah have do bidding and carry load in the|middle|east for quite some time and do think that be a blot on record that let down have thing get better the shah whatever may have do be build low cost housing have take land away from the mullahs and be distribute to the peasant so could be landowner thing of that kind but turn over to a maniacal fanatic who have slaughter thousands|and|thousand of people call execution the matter of somoza no never defend somoza and as a matter of fact the previous administration stand by and so do — not that could have do anything in position at that time but for this revolution to take place and the promise of the revolution be democracy human right free labor union free press and then just as castro have do in cuba the sandinistas oust the other party to the revolution many of be now the contra exile some jail some murder some and instal a marxist leninist totalitarian government and what have to say about this be many time and this have to do with the philippines also know there be thing there in the philippines that do not look good to from the standpoint right now of democratic right but what be the alternative be a large communist movement to take over the philippines have be friend since inception as a nation and think that have have enough of a record of let — under the guise of revolution someone that think be a little more right than would be let that person go and then wind up with totalitarianism pure and simple as the alternative and think that be well off for example with the philippines of try to retain friendship and help right the wrong see rather than throw to the wolf and then face a communist power in the pacific mr kondracke mr. president since the|united|state have strategically important basis in the philippines would the overthrow of president marcos constitute a threat to vital american interest and if so what would do about president reagan well as say have to look at what an overthrow there would mean and what the government would be that would follow and there be every evidence every indication that that government would be hostile to the|united|state and that would be a severe blow to ability there in the pacific mr kondracke and what would do about mr newman sorry be sorry have ask the followup question mr. mondale rebuttal mr mondale perhaps in no area do disagree more than this administration 's policy on human right go to the philippines as vice president press for human right call for the release of aquino and make progress that have be stall on both the subic and the clark airfield basis what explain this administration cozye up to the argentine dictator after take over fortunately a democracy take over but this nation be embarrass by this current administration 's adoption of policy what happen in south|africa where for example winner two|days|ago say this administration be see as work with the oppressive government of south|africa that hurt this nation need to stand for human right need to make clear be for human liberty national security and human right must go together but this administration time and time again have lose way in this field mr newman president reagan rebuttal president reagan well the invasion of afghanistan do not take place on watch have describe what have happen in iran and be not here then either do not think that record of human right can be assail think that have observe and have do good to see that human right be extend throughout the world mr. mondale have recently announce a plan of to get the democracy together and to work with the whole world to turn to democracy and be glad to hear say that because that be what have be do ever since announce to the|british|parliament that think should do this human right be not advanced when at the same time then stand back and say whoops do not know the gun be load and have another totalitarian power on hand mr newman in this segment because of the pressure of time there will be no rebuttal and there will be no followup question mr. trewhitt question to president reagan mr trewhitt question to each candidate mr newman question to each candidate & nbsp nuclear weapon mr trewhitt mr. president could take back to something say earlier and if be misquote please correct but understand to say that if the development of space military technology be successful may give the soviets a demonstration and say here be which sound to as if may be try to gain the sort of advantage that would enable to dictate term and which will then suggest to may mean scrap a generation of nuclear strategy call mutual deterrence in which in effect hold each other hostage be that intention president reagan well can not say that have roundtable that and sit down with the|chiefs|of|staff but have say that seem to that this could be a logical step in what be ultimate goal ultimate dream and that be the elimination of nuclear weapon in the world and seem to that this could be an adjunct or certainly a great assist agent in get that do be not go to roll over as mr. mondale suggest and give something that could turn around and be use against but think be a very interesting proposal to see if can find first of all something that render those weapon obsolete incapable of mission but mr. mondale seem to approve mad mad be mutual assure destruction meaning if use nuclear weapon on the only thing have to keep from do be that will kill as many people of as will kill of think that to do everything can to find as say something that would destroy weapon and not human be a great step forward in human right mr trewhitt mr. mondale could ask to address the question of nuclear strategy then the formal doctrine be very arcane but be go to ask to deal with anyway do believe in mad mutual assured destruction mutual deterrence as have be practice for the last generation mr mondale believe in a sensible arm control approach that bring down these weapon to manageable level would like to see elimination and in the meantime have to be strong enough to make certain that the|soviet|union never tempt us now here have to decide between generalize objective and reality the president say want to eliminate or reduce the number of nuclear weapon but in fact these|last|four|year have see more weapon build a wide and more vigorous arm race than in human history say want a system that will make nuclear war safe so nobody be go to get hurt well maybe someday somebody can dream of that but why start an arm race now why destabilize relationship why threaten space satellite upon which depend why pursue a strategy that would delegate to computer the question of start a war a president to defend this country and to get arm control must master what be go on accept objective and dream all do but the hard reality be that must know what be do and pursue those objective that be possible in time be oppose every effort of every president to do so and in the|four|year of administration be fail to do so and if want a tough president who use that strength to get arm control and draw the line in the heaven vote for walter|mondale applause mr newman please must again ask the audience not to applaud not to cheer not to demonstrate feeling in any way have arrive at the point in the debate now where call for closing statement have the|full|four|minute each of mr. mondale will go first & nbsp closing statement mr mondale want to thank the|league|of|women|voter the good citizen of kansas|city and president reagan for agree to debate this|evening this|evening talk about national strength believe need to be strong and will keep strong

vision of where this nation should go tonight as americans have a choice and be entitle to know where would take this country if decide to elect as president would press for long term vigorous

not temporary be forever and as americans generation should protect this wonderful land for child want a nation of fairness where no one be deny the fullness of life or discriminate against and deal compassionately with those in midst who be in trouble and above all want a nation that be strong since debate two|weeks|ago the|united|state and the|soviet|union have build a|hundre more warhead enough to kill million of americans and million of soviet citizen this do not strengthen this weaken the chance of civilization to survive remember the night before become vice president be give the briefing and tell that any time night or day may be call upon to make the most fateful decision on earth whether to fire these atomic weapon that could destroy the human specie that lesson tell thing pick a president that know will know if that tragic moment ever come what must know because there will be no time for staff committee or adviser a president must know right then but above all pick a president who will fight to avoid the|day when that god awful decision ever need to be make and that be why this election be so terribly important america and americans decide not just what be happen in this country be the strong and most powerful free society on earth when make that judgment be decide not only the future of nation in a very profound respect be decide the future of the world need to move on be time for america to find new leadership please join in this cause to move confidently and with a sense of assurance and command to build the bless future of nation mr newman president reagan summation please president reagan yes thank to the|league|of|women|voters to the panelist the moderator and to the people of kansas|city for warm hospitality and greeting think the american people tonight have much to be grateful for an economic recovery that have become expansion freedom and most of all be at peace be grateful for the chance to reaffirm commitment to reduce nuclear weapon and to eliminate entirely the question before come down to this do want to see america return to the policy of weakness of or do want to go forward march together as a nation of strength and that be go to continue to be strong should not be dwell on the past or even the present the meaning of this election be the future and whether be go to grow and provide the job and the opportunity for all americans and that need several|years|ago be give an assignment to write a letter be to go into a time capsule and would be read in when that time capsule be open remember drive down the california coast day mind be full of what be go to put in that letter about the problem and the issue that confront in time and what do about but could not completely neglect the beauty around the pacific out there on side of the highway shin in the sunlight the mountain of the coast range rise on the other side and find wonder what would be like for someone wonder if someone would be drive down that highway and if would see the same thing and with that thought realize what a job have with that letter would be write a letter to people who know everything there be to know about know nothing about would know all about problem would know how solve and whether solution be beneficial to down through the|year or whether hurt would also know that live in a world with terrible weapon nuclear weapon of terrible destructive power aim at each other capable of cross the ocean in a matter of minute and destroy civilization as know and then think to what be go to say about what be those people go to think will know whether use those weapon or not well what will say about from now depend on how keep rendezvous with destiny will do the thing that know must be do and know that down in history or perhaps before someone will say thank god for those people back in the|1980s for preserve freedom for save for this bless planet call earth with all grandeur and beauty know be grateful to all of for give the opportunity to serve for these|four|years and seek reelection because want more than anything else to try to complete the new beginning that chart george|bush who think be of the fine vice presidents this country have ever have george|bush and have crisscross the country and have have in these|last|few|months a wonderful experience have meet young america have meet son and daughter mr newman mr. president be oblige to cut off there under the rule of the debate be sorry president reagan all right be just go mr newman perhaps should point out that the rule under which do that be agree upon by the campaigns— president reagan know mr newman with the league as know sir president reagan know yes mr newman thank mr. president thank mr. mondale thank also to the panel finally to audience thank and the|league|of|women|voters ask to say to do not forget to vote on november|6.&nbsp view transcript transcript ms. ridings be dorothy|riding president of the|league|of|women|voter the sponsor of tonight 's first presidential debate between republican ronald|reagan and democrat walter|mondale tonight 's debate mark the third consecutive presidential election in which the league be present the candidate for the nation 's high office in face to face debate panelist be james|wieghart national political correspondent for scripps howard|news|service

moderator barbara ms. walters thank dorothy a few word as begin tonight 's debate about the format the position of the candidate that is who answer question first and who give the last statement be determine by a toss of a coin between the candidate mr. mondale win and that mean that choose to give the final closing statement mean too that the president will answer the first question first hope that be clear if be not will become clear as the debate go on further the candidate will be address as each want and will therefore be call mr. president and mr. mondale since there will also be a second debate between the presidential candidate tonight will focus primarily on the economy and other domestic issue the debate be build around question from the panel in each of segment a reporter will ask the candidate the same general question then — and this be important each candidate will have the chance to rebut what the other have say and the final segment of the debate will be the closing segment and the candidate will each have for closing statement and as have say mr. mondale will be the last person on the program to speak and now would like to add a personal note if may as dorothy|riding point out have be involve now in presidential debate either as a moderator or as a panelist in the past there be no problem in select panelist tonight however there be to have be panelist participate in this debate the candidate be give a list of almost|100 qualified journalist from all the medium and could agree on only these fine journalist as moderator and on behalf of fellow journalist very much regret as do the|league|of|women|voters that this situation have occur and now let begin the debate with the first question from james|wieghart mr. wieghart the nation 's economy mr. wieghart mr. president in promise the american people in campaign a balanced budget by have now have more and big deficit in have be in office mr. president do have a secret plan to balance the budget sometime in a second term and if so would lay out that plan for tonight the president have a plan not a secret plan as a matter of fact be the economic recovery program that present when take office in be true that earlier work with some very prominent economist have come up during the campaign with an economic program that think could rectify the great problem confront the double digit inflation the high tax rate that think be hurt the economy the stagflation that be undergo before even the|election|day something that none of those economist have even predict have happen that the economy be so worsen that be openly say that what have think on the basis of plan could have bring a balanced budget no that be no longer possible so the plan that have have and that be follow be a plan that be base on growth in the economy recovery without inflation and reduce the share that the government be take from the gross national product which have become a drag on the economy already have a recovery that have be go on for about|21|month to the point that can now call an expansion under that this|year have see a reduction in the deficit from last|year base mainly on the increase revenue the government be get without raise tax rate tax cut think be very instrumental in bring about this economic recovery have reduce inflation to about|a|third of what be the interest rate have come down about|9 or point and think must come down further in the|last|21|month more|than|6|million people have get job there have be create new job for those people to where there be now civilian work where there be before if count the military so believe that as continue to reduce the level of government spending the increase rate of increase in government spending which have come down from and at the same time as the growth in the economy increase the revenue the government get without raise taxis those line will meet and when meet that be a balanced budget mr. wieghart mr. president the|congressional|budget|office have some bad news the line be not about to meet accord to projection project that the budget deficit will continue to climb in the|year|1989 project a budget deficit of in view of that and in view of the economic recovery be now enjoy would make sense to propose a tax increase or take some other fiscal measure to reduce that deficit now when time be relatively good the president the deficit be the result of excessive government spending do not very frankly take seriously the|congressional|budget|office projection because have be wrong on virtually all of include the fact that recovery be not go to take place to begin with but have take place but as say have the rate of increase in government spend down to if the rate of increase in government spending can be hold at we're not far from there by that would have reduce the budget deficit down to a or level at the same time if can have a recovery continue through that same period of time that will mean without an increase in tax rate that will mean more in government revenue and so think that the line can meet actually in constant dollar in the domestic side of the budget there have be no spending increase in that have be here mr. wieghart mr. mondale the carter mondale administration do not come close to balance the budget in in office either despite the fact that president carter do promise a balanced budget during term have propose a plan combine tax increase and budgetary cut and other change in the administration of the government that would reduce the project budget deficit by third to approximately|$87|billion in that still be an enormous deficit that will be run for these|4|year what other step do think should be take to reduce this deficit and position the country for economic growth mr. mondale of the key test of leadership be whether one see clearly the nature of the problem confront by nation and perhaps the dominant domestic issue of time be what do do about these enormous deficit respect the president respect the presidency and think know that but the fact of be every estimate by this administration about the size of the deficit have be off by billions|and|billions|of|dollars as a matter of fact over have miss the mark by nearly|$600|billion be tell would have a balanced budget in be deficit instead and now have a major question face the american people as to whether will deal with this deficit and get down for the sake of a healthy recovery virtually every economic analysis that have hear of include the distinguished congressional|budget|office which be respect by think almost everyone say that even with historically high level of economic growth will suffer a deficit in other word do not converge as the president suggest get large even with growth what that mean be that will continue to have devastating problem with foreign trade this be the bad trade year in american history by far rural and farm friend will have continue devastation real interest rate the real cost of interest will remain very very high and many economist be predict that be move into a period of very slow growth because the economy be taper off and may be a recession get down to a level below percent of gross national product with a policy that be fair have stand up and tell the american people that think be a real problem that can destroy long term economic growth and have tell what think should be do think this be a test of leadership and think the american people know the difference mr. wieghart mr. mondale other way to attack the deficit be further reduction in spending the president have submit a number of proposal to congress to do just that and in many instance the house control by the democrats have oppose be not aspect of leadership for prominent democrats such as to encourage responsible reduction in spending and thereby reduce the deficit mr. mondale absolutely and propose over|a|hundred|billion|dollar in cut in federal spending over but be not go to cut out of social|security and medicare and student assistance and things—[applause]—that people need these people depend upon all of for the little security that have and be not go to do that way the rate of defense spending increase can be slow certainly can find a coffeepot that cost something and there be other way of squeeze this budget without constantly pick on senior citizen and the most vulnerable in american life and that be why the congress include the republicans have not go along with the president 's recommendation ms. walters would like to ask the audience please to refrain from applaud either side just take away from the time for candidate and now be time for the rebuttal mr. president for rebuttal the president yes do not believe that mr. mondale have a plan for balance the budget have a plan for raise taxis and as a matter of fact the big single tax increase in nation 's history take place and for previous to take office taxis double in the|united|state and the budget increase so there be no ratio between tax and balance a budget whether borrow the money or whether simply tax away from the people be take the same amount of money out of the private sector unless and until bring down government 's share of what be take with regard to social|security hope there will be more time than just this minute to mention that but will say this a president should never say never but be go to violate that rule and say never will never stand for a reduction of the social|security benefit to the people that be now get ms. walters mr. mondale mr. mondale well that be exactly the commitment that be make to the american people in would never reduce benefit and of course what happen right after the election be propose to cut social|security benefit by reduce the adjustment for inflation cut out minimum benefit for the poor on social|security remove educational benefit for dependent whose widow be trying???with widow try to get through college everybody remember that people know what happen there be a difference have fight for social|security and medicare and for thing to help people who be vulnerable all life and will do as president of the|united|state ms. walters thank very much will now begin with segment number with colleague ms. sawyer leadership qualities ms. sawyer mr. president mr. mondale the public opinion poll do suggest that the american people be most concerned about the personal leadership characteristic of the candidate and each of have question the other 's leadership ability mr. president have say that mr. mondale 's leadership would take the country down the path of defeatism and despair and vice president bush have call whine and hope for bad news and mr. mondale have say that president reagan offer showmanship not leadership that have not master what must know to command government would like to ask each of to substantiate claim mr mondale first give specific to support claim that president reagan be a showman not a leader have not master what must know to be president after and then second tell what personal leadership characteristic have that do not mr. mondale well first of all think the first answer this|evening suggest exactly what be say there be no question that face this massive deficit and almost everybody agree unless get down the chance for long term healthy growth be nil and be also unfair to dump these tremendous bill on child the president say will disappear overnight because of some reason no one else believe that be the case do and be stand up to the issue with an answer that be fair think that be what leadership be all about there be a difference between be a quarterback and a cheerleader and when there be a real problem a president must confront what be refer to of course in the comment that refer to be the situation in lebanon now for occasion after another embassy be assault in the same way by a truck with demolition the first time and do not criticize the president because these thing can happen once and sometimes twice the second time the barrack in lebanon be assault as all remember there be or commission report recommendation by the cia the|state|department and the other and the third time there be even a warning from the terrorist now believe that a president must command that white|house and those who work for be the tough job on earth and must master the fact and insist that thing that must be do be do believe that the way in which will approach the presidency be what be need because all life that have be the way in which have seek to lead and that be why in this campaign be tell exactly what want to do be answer question be try to provide leadership now before the election so that the american people can participate in that decision ms. sawyer have say mr. mondale that the poll have give low rating on leadership than president reagan because message have fail to get through give that have be in public office for so|many|year what account for the failure of message to get through mr mondale well think be get better all the time and think tonight as contrast for the first time differ approach to government to value to the leadership in this country think as this debate go forward the american people will have for the first time a chance to weigh the of against each other and think as a part of that process what be try to say will come across and that be that must lead must command must direct and a president must see like be must stand for the value of decency that the american people stand for and must use the power of the|white|house to try to control these nuclear weapon and lead this world toward a safe world ms. sawyer mr. president the issue be leadership in personal term first do think as vice president bush say that mr. mondale 's campaign be of whine and hope for bad news and second what leadership characteristic do possess that mr. mondale do not the president well whether do or not let suggest own idea about the leadership factor since have ask and incidentally may say that with regard to the 25-percent cut in social|security before get to the answer to question the only 25-percent cut that know of be accompany that huge tax increase be a cut of in the benefit for every american who be bear after now leadership first of all think must have some principle believe in in mine happen to believe in the people and believe that the people be suppose to be dominant in society that not government be to have control of own affair to the great extent possible with an orderly society now have that think also that in leadership well believe that find people position such as be in who have the talent and ability to do the thing that be need in the various department of government do not believe that a leader should be spend time in the oval|office decide who be go to play tennis on the white|house court and let those people go with the guideline of overall policy not look over shoulder and nitpick the manner in which go at the job be ultimately responsible however for that job but also believe something else about that believe that and when become governor of california start this and continue in this office that any issue that come before have instruct cabinet member and staff be not to bring up any of the political ramification that may surround the issue do not want to hear want to hear only argument as to whether be good or bad for the people be morally right and on that basis and that basis alone make a decision on every issue now with regard to feeling about why think that record bespeak possible take back to the same thing that know under the previous administration record be that speak in praise of deficit several time say be not to be abhor that as a matter of fact at time say wish the deficit could be double because stimulate the economy and help reduce unemployment ms. sawyer as a followup let draw in another specific if could — a specific that the democrats have claim about campaign that be essentially base on imagery and specific that allege be that for instance recently show up at the opening ceremony of a buffalo old age housing project when in fact policy be to cut federal housing subsidy for the elderly yet be there to have picture take with the president policy be not to cut subsidy have believe in partnership and that be an example of a partnership between not only local government and but also between the private sector that build that particular structure and this be what have be try to do be involve the|federal|government in such partnership be today subsidize housing for people and be go to continue along that line have no thought of throw people out into the snow whether because of age or need have preserve the safety net for the people with true need in this country and have be pure demagoguery that have in some way shut off all the charitable program or many of for the people who have real need the safety net be there and be take care of more people than have ever be take care of before by any administration in this country ms. walters mr. mondale an opportunity for to rebut mr. mondale well guess be remind a little bit of what will|roger once say about hoover say be not what do not know that bother be what know for sure that just be not so laughter the fact of be the president 's budget seek to cut social|security by be not an opinion be a fact and when the president be ask the|other|day what do want to cut in the budget say cut those thing ask for but do not get that be social|security and medicare the second fact be that the housing unit for senior citizen that the president dedicate in buffalo be only make possible through a federal assistance program for senior citizen that the president 's budget seek to terminate so if would have way there would not have be any housing project there at all this administration have take a meat cleaver out in term of federal assist housing and the record be there have to see the fact before can draw conclusion ms. walters mr. president the president well let just respond with regard to social|security when take office discover that the program that the carter mondale administration have say would solve the fiscal problem of social|security for the|next|50|year would not solve for social|security be due to go bankrupt before any proposal that make at that time be at the request of the chairman a democrat of of the lead committee who say have to do something before the program go break and the check bounce and so make a proposal and then in use that proposal in a demagogic fashion for the campaign and after the election in come to and say social|security know be broke indeed have to borrow to pay the check and then ask for a bipartisan commission which would ask for from the beginning to sit down and work out a solution and so the whole matter of what to do with social|security have be resolve by bipartisan legislation and be on a sound basis now for as far as can see into the|next|century ms. walters mr. president begin segment number with fred|barne religion mr. barnes mr. president would describe religious belief note particularly whether consider a bear again christian and explain how these belief affect presidential decision the president well be raise to have a faith and a belief and have be a member of a church since be a small boy in particular church do not use that term bear again so do not know whether would fit that that particular term but have thank to mother god rest soul the firm possible belief and faith in god and do not believe — believe should say as lincoln once say that could not — would be the most stupid man in the world if think could confront the duty of the office hold if could not turn to someone who be strong and great than all other and do resort to prayer at the same time however have not believe that prayer should be introduce into an election or be a part of a political campaign or religion a part of that campaign as a matter of fact think religion become a part of this campaign when mr. mondale 's running mate say be not a good christian so do play a part in life have no hesitancy in say so and as say do not believe that could carry on unless have a belief in a high authority and a belief that prayer be answer mr. barnes give those belief mr. president why do not attend service regularly either by go to church or by invite a minister to the|white|house as president nixon use to do or someone to camp|david as president carter use to do the president the answer to question be very simple about why do not go to church have go to church regularly all life and start to here in washington and now in the position hold and in the world in which live where embassy do get blow up in beirut — we're suppose to talk about that on the debate the|21st understand — but pose a threat to several|hundred people if go to church know the threat that be make against all know the possibility of terrorism have see the barricade that have have to be build around the|white|house and therefore do not feel and minister know this and support in this position do not feel that have a right to go to church know that be there could cause something of the kind that have see in other place in beirut for example and miss go to church but think the lord understand applause ms. walters may ask please—[applause]—may ask the audience please to refrain from applause fred second question mr. barnes mr. mondale would describe religious belief and mention whether consider a bear again christian and explain how those belief would affect decision as president mr. mondale first of all accept president reagan 's affirmation of faith be sure that all accept and admire commitment to faith and be strengthen all of by that fact be a son of a methodist minister wife be the daughter of a presbyterian minister and do not know if have be bear again but know be bear into a christian family and believe have sing at more wedding and more funeral than anybody ever to seek the presidency whether that help or not do not know have a deep religious faith family do be fundamental be probably the reason that be in politic think faith tell instruct about the moral life that should lead and think be all together on that what bother be this grow tendency to try to use one 's own personal interpretation of faith politically to question other ' faith and to try to use the instrumentality of government to impose those view on other all history tell that that be a mistake when the republican platform say that from here on out be go to have a religious test for judge before be select for the federal court and then jerry|falwell announce that that mean get at|least|two justice of the|supreme|court think that be an abuse of faith in country this nation be the most religious nation on earth more people go to church and synagogue than any other nation on earth — and be because keep the politician and the state out of the personal exercise of faith that be why faith in the|united|state be pure and unpollute by the intervention of politician and think if want to continue — as do to have a religious nation let keep that line and never cross ms. walters thank mr. barnes next question have time for rebuttal now mr. barnes think have a followup ms. walters yes ask if do be sorry mr. barnes yes do ms. walters think waive mr. barnes yes mr. mondale have complain just now about jerry|falwell and have complain other time about other fundamentalist in politic correct if be wrong but do not recall ever complain about minister who be involve in the civil right movement or in the anti - vietnam war demonstration or about black preacher who have be so involved in american politic be only conservative minister that object to mr. mondale no what object— applause]—what object to what object to be someone seek to use faith to question the faith of another or to use that faith and seek to use the power of government to impose on other a minister who be in civil right or in the conservative movement because believe faith instruct to do that admire the fact that the faith speak to and that be moral people hopefully accept and rejoice in be when try to use that to undermine the integrity of private political or private religious faith and the use of the state be where for the most personal decision in american life that be where draw the line ms. walters thank now mr. president rebuttal the president yes be very difficult to rebut because find in so much agreement with mr. mondale too want that wall that be in the constitution of separation of church and state to remain there the only attack have make be on people who apparently would break away at that wall from the government side use the government use the power of the court and so forth to hinder that part of the constitution that say the government shall not only not establish a religion shall not inhibit the practice of religion and have be use these thing to have government through court order inhibit the practice of religion a child want to say grace in a school cafeteria and a court rule that can not do because be school property these be the type of thing that think have be happen in a kind of a secular way that have be erode that separation and be oppose to that with regard to a platform on the|supreme|court can only say thing about that have appoint member to the|supreme|court sandra|day|o'connor will stand on record on that and if have the opportunity to appoint any more will do in the same manner that do in select ms. walters mr. mondale rebuttal please mr. mondale the platform to which the president refer in fact call for a religious test in the selection of judge and jerry|falwell say that mean get two|or|three judge and would involve a religious test for the first time in american life let take the example that the president cite believe in prayer family pray have never have any difficulty find time to pray but do want a constitutional amendment adopt of the kind propose by the president that get the local politician into the business of select prayer that child must either recite in school or be embarrassed and ask to excuse who would write the prayer what would say how would be resolve when those dispute occur seem to that a moment 's reflection tell why the united states senate turn that amendment down because will undermine the practice of honest faith in country by politicize do not want that ms. walters thank mr. mondale time be up for this round go into the second round of questioning begin again with jim|wieghart jim political issue mr. wieghart after that discussion this may be like go from the sublime to the ridiculous but here go have a political question for mr. mondale laughter poll indicate a massive change in the electorate away from the coalition that have long make the|democratic|party a majority blue collar worker young professional child and much of the middle class now regard as independents or republican instead of democrats and the gap the edge the democrats have in party registration seem to be narrow would like to ask mr. mondale what be cause this be the|democratic|party out of sync with the majority of americans and will soon be replace as the majority party by the republicans what do think need to be do about as a democrat mr. mondale answer be that this campaign be not over yet and when people vote think be go to see a very strong verdict by the american people that favor the approach that be talk about the american people want arm control do not want this arm race and do not want this deadly new effort to bring weapon into the heaven and want an american foreign policy that lead toward a safe world the american people see this debt and know be get to come down and if will not come down the economy be go to slow down maybe go into a recession see this tremendous influx and swamping of cheap foreign import in this country that have cost over job give farmer the|worst|year in american history and know this debt must come down as well because be unfair to child the american people want this environment protect know that these toxic waste dump should have be clean up a long time ago and know that people 's life and health be be risk because have have an administration that have be totally insensitive to the law and the demand for the protection of the environment the american people want child educate want to get edge back in science and want a policy head by the president that help close this gap that be widen between the|united|state and europe and japan the american people want to keep open door want those civil right law enforce want the equal right amendment ratify want equal pay for comparable effort for woman and want because have understand from the beginning that when open door be all strong just as be at the olympics think as make the case the american people will increasingly come to cause mr. wieghart mr. mondale be not possible that the american people have hear message and be listen but be reject mr. mondale well tonight have the first debate over the deficit the president say will disappear automatically have say be go to take some work think the american people will draw own conclusion secondly have say that will not support the cut in social|security and medicare and the rest that the president have propose the president answer that do not happen or if do be resolve later in a commission as the record develop think be go to become increasingly clear that what be say and where want to take this country be exactly where the country want to go and the comparison of approach be such that think will lead to further strength mr. wieghart mr. president and party be benefit from what appear to be an erosion of the old democratic coalition but have not lay out a specific agenda to take this shift beyond november|6th what be program for america for the|next|decade with some specificity the president well again be run on the record think sometimes mr. mondale 's run away from but be run on the record of what have ask for will continue to try to get thing that do not get in a program that have already bring the rate of spending of government down from to a program of return authority and autonomy to the local and state government that have be unjustly seize by the|federal|government and may find those word in a democratic platform of know because be a democrat at that time and leave the party eventually because could no longer follow the turn in the democratic leadership that take down an entirely different path a path of centralize authority in the|federal|government lack trust in the american people promise when take office that would reduce inflation have to third of what be promise that would reduce taxis do across the board that barely hold even with — if do that much with the gigantic tax increase impose in but at least take that burden away from say that would create job for people and in say that would become respected in the world once again and that would refurbish national defense to the place that could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament reduction of arm and hopefully an elimination of nuclear weapon have do that all of the thing that say would do from inflation be down interest rate be down unemployment fall all of those thing have do and think this be something the american people see think also know that have a commission that come in a|year|ago with a recommendation on education on excellence in education and today without the|federal|government be involve other than pass on to the school district the word from that commission find 35|state with task force now deal with educational problem find that school be extend the curriculum to now have force teaching of mathematic and science and so forth all of these thing have bring an improvement in the college entrance exam for the first time in some|20|year so think that many democrats be see the same thing this democrat see the leadership be not take where want to go mr. wieghart mr. president much of what say affect the quality of life of many americans — income the way live and so forth but there be an aspect to quality of life that lie beyond the private sector which have to do with neighborhood city street park environment in those area have difficulty see what program be and what feel the federal responsibility be in these area of the quality of life in the public sector that affect everybody and even enormous wealth by individual can not create the kind of environment that may like the president there be task that government legitimately should enforce and task that government perform well and have name some of crime have come down the|last|2|years for the first time in many many|decades that have come down or since have keep records—2 consecutive year and last|year come down the big drop in crime that have have think that have have something to do with that just as have with the drug problem nationwide the environment yes feel as strongly as anyone about the preservation of the environment when take office find that the national park be so dirty and contain so many hazard lack of safety feature that stop buy additional park land until have rectify this with what be to be a program but be just about finish already and now be go back to budget for additional land for park have add millions|of|acre to the wilderness land to the game refuge think that be out in front of most — and see that the red light be blink so can not continue but have get more ms. walters well will have a chance when rebuttal time come up perhaps mr. president mr. mondale now be turn for rebuttal mr. mondale the president say that when the|democratic|party make turn leave the|year that decide have lose way be the|year that john|f.|kennedy be run against richard|nixon be chairman of minnesotans|for|kennedy president reagan be chairman of a thing call democrats for nixon now maybe make a wrong turn with kennedy but will be proud of support all of life and be very happy that john|kennedy be elect because john|kennedy look at the future with courage see what need to be do and understand own government the president just say that government be shrink be not be now the large peacetime government ever in term of the take from the total economy and instead of retreat — instead of be strong where should be strong want to make strong and intervene in the most private and personal question in american life that be where government should not be ms. walters mr. president the president before campaign as a democrat for a republican candidate for president have already vote for dwight|eisenhowe to be president of the|united|state and so change have come earlier than that have not get around to reregistere as yet find that be rather difficult to do but finally do there be some other thing that have be say here — back and say that may be able to dredge up mr. mondale refer to the farmers'|worst|year the farmer be not the victim of anything this administration have do the farmer be the victim of the double digit inflation and the 21|1/2-percent interest rate of the carter mondale administration and the grain embargo which destroy reliability nationwide as a supplier all of these thing be presently be rectify and think that be go to salvage the farmer as a matter of fact there have be less than quarter of percent of foreclosure of the loan from government that the farmer have ms. walters thank mr. president will now turn to diane|sawyer for round of question diane abortion ms. sawyer would like to turn to an area that think few people enjoy discuss but that probably should tonight because the position of the candidate be so clearly different and lead to very different policy consequence and that be abortion and right to life be explore for personal view of abortion and specifically how would want apply as public policy first mr. president do consider abortion murder or a sin and second how hard would work what kind of priority would give in second term legislation to make abortion illegal and specifically would make certain as party platform urge that federal justice that appoint be pro - life the president have believe that in the appointment of judge that all that be specify in the party platform be that respect the sanctity of human life now that would want to see in any judge and with regard to any issue have to do with human life but with regard to abortion and have a feeling that this be there be be some reference without name here in the remark of mr. mondale tie to inject religion into government with abortion be not a problem of religion be a problem of the constitution believe that until and unless someone can establish that the unborn child be not a live human being then that child be already protect by the constitution which guarantee life liberty and the pursuit of happiness to all of and think that this be what should concentrate on be try know there be week and week of testimony before a senate committee there be medical authority there be religious — there be cleric there everyone talk about this matter of pro - life and at the end of all of that not shred of evidence be introduce that the unborn child be not alive have see premature birth that be now grow up happy people go around also there be a strange dichotomy in this whole position about court rule that abortion be not the taking of a human life in california sometime ago a man beat a woman so savagely that unborn child be bear dead with a fractured skull and the california|state|legislature unanimously pass a law that be sign by the then democratic governor — sign a law that say that any man who so abuse a pregnant woman that cause the death of unborn child shall be charge with murder now be not strange that that same woman could have take the life of unborn child and be abortion and not murder but if somebody else do that be murder and use the term death of the unborn child so this have be feeling about abortion that have a problem now to determine and all the evidence so far come down on the side of the unborn child be a live human being ms. sawyer a part followup do take from what have say about the platform then that do not regard the language and do not regard in own appointment abortion position a test of any kind for justice that should be and also if abortion be make illegal how would want enforce who would be the police unit that would investigate and would want the woman who have abortion to be prosecute the president the law regard that always be state law be only when the|supreme|court hand down a decision that the|federal|government intervene in what have always be a state policy law against murder be state law so would think that this would be the point of enforcement on this as say feel that have a problem here to resolve and no one have approach from that matter do not happen that the church that belong to have that as part of dogma know that some church do now be a sin if be take a human life at the same time in judeo christian tradition recognize the right of take a human life in self defense and therefore have always believe that a mother if medically be determined that life be at risk if go through with the pregnancy have a right then to take the life of even own unborn child in defense of own ms. sawyer mr. mondale to turn to do consider abortion a murder or a sin and bridge from what president reagan say have write that if society do not know whether life do human life in fact do begin at conception as long as there be a doubt that the unborn child should at least be give the benefit of the doubt and that there should be protection for that unborn child mr. mondale this be of the most emotional and difficult issue that could possibly be debate think question however underscore the fact there be probably no way that government should or could answer this question in every individual case and in the private life of the american people the constitutional amendment propose by president reagan would make a crime for a woman to have an abortion if have be rap or suffer from incest be really the view of the american people however feel on the question of abortion that government ought to be reach into living room and make choice like this think can not work will not work and will lead to all kind of cynical evasion of the law those who can afford to have will continue to have the disadvantaged will go out in the back alley as use to do think these question be inherently personal and moral and every individual instance be different every american should be aware of the seriousness of the step but there be some thing that government can do and some thing can not do now the example that the president cite have nothing to do with abortion somebody go to a woman and nearly kill that be always be a serious crime and always should be a serious crime but how do that compare with the problem of a woman who be rap do really want those decision make by judge who have be pick because will agree to find the person guilty do not think so and think be go in exactly the wrong direction in america on basic moral question have always let the people decide in own personal life have not feel so insecure that have reach for the club of state to have point of view be be a good instinct and be the most religious people on earth final point president reagan as governor of california sign a bill which be perhaps the most liberal pro - abortion bill of any state in the union ms. sawyer but if can get back for a moment on point which be the question of when human life begin a part followup first of all at what point do believe that human life begin in the growth of a fetus and second of all say that government should not be involve in the decision yet there be those who would say that government be involve and the consequence of the involvement be abortion in and how do feel about that mr. mondale the basic decision of the|supreme|court be that each person have to make this judgment in own life and that be the way be be do and be a personal and private moral judgment do not know the answer to when life begin and be not that simple either have get another life involve and if be rape how do draw moral judgment on that if be incest how do draw moral judgment on that do every woman in america have to present before some judge pick by jerry|falwell to clear personal judgment will not work applause ms. walters be sorry to do this but really must talk to the audience be all invite guest know be waste time in talk to but really be very unfair of to applaud sometimes louder less loud and ask as people who be invite here and polite people to refrain have time now for rebuttal mr. president the president yes well with regard to this be a personal choice be not that what a murderer be insist on or right to kill someone because of whatever fault think justifie that now be not capable and do not think be any of to make this determination that must be make with regard to human life be simply say that believe that that be where the effort should be direct — to make that determination do not think that any of should be call upon here to stand and make a decision as to what other thing may come under the self defense tradition that too would have to be work out then when once recognize that be talk about a life but in this great society of would not make a lot more sense in this gentle and kind society if have a program that make possible for when incident come along in which someone feel must do away with that unborn child that instead make available for the adoption there be a|million|and|a|half people out there stand in line wait to adopt child who can not have any other way ms. walters mr. mondale mr. mondale agree with that and that be why be a principal sponsor of a liberal adoption law so that more of these child could come to term so that the young mother be educate so find an option an alternative be all for that but the question be whether this other option propose by the president should be pursue and do not agree with since have get about|20|second let just say thing the question of agriculture come up a|minute|ago net farm income be off in and every farmer know and the effect of these economic policy be like a massive grain embargo which have cause farm export to drop be be a big failure oppose the grain embargo in administration be opposed to these policy as well ms. walters be sit here like the great schoolteacher let both get away with thing because one do the other one do may ask in the future that the rebuttal stick to what the rebuttal be and also foreign policy will be the next debate stop drag in by ear into this one laughter now have admonish would like to say to the panel be allow question and followup would try as best could not to ask and know be something all want to do and question as part and and as part have say that fred be yours federal taxation mr. barnes thank mr. mondale let ask about middle class americans and the taxis pay now be talk not about the rich or the poor know view on taxis but about family earn a year do think that those family be overtax or undertaxed by the|federal|government mr. mondale in opinion as deal with this deficit people from about|$70,000 a year on down have to be deal with very very carefully because be the one who do not get any relief the first time around under the tax bill people make a year get in tax relief over 3|year while people make a year all taxis consider get no relief at all or taxis actually go up that be why proposal protect everybody from a year or less against any tax increase and treat those and under in a way that be more beneficial than the way the president propose with a sale tax or a fiat tax what do this mean in real life well the other day vice president bush disclose tax return to the american people be of the wealthy americans and be vice president in think pay about|40|percent in taxis in as a result of these tax preference pay a|little|over|12|percent in taxis that mean that pay a low percent in taxis than the janitor who clean up office or the chauffeur who drive to work believe need some fairness and that be why have propose what think be a fair and a responsible proposal that help protect these people who have already get no relief or actually get a tax increase mr. barnes sound as if be say think this group of taxpayer make a year be already overtax yet tax proposal would increase taxis think aide have say those earn about|$25,000|to|$35,000 tax rate would go up — tax bill would go up a|hundred|dollars and from more than that several|hundred|dollars would not that stifle incentive to work and invest and so on and also hurt the recovery mr. mondale the first thing be everybody and under would have no tax increase mr. reagan after the election be go to have to propose a tax increase and will have to compare what propose and secretary of the treasury say be study a sale tax or a value add tax be the same thing hit middle- and moderate income americans and leave wealthy americans largely untouched up until about|$70,000 as go up the ladder proposal will be far more beneficial as soon as get the economy on a sound ground as well would like to see the total repeal of indexing do not think can do that for a|few|year but at some point want to do that as well mr. barnes mr. president let try this on do think middle income americans be overtax or undertaxed the president know be not go to say this at all but can not help there go again laughter do not have a plan to tax or increase taxis be not go to increase taxis can understand why be mr. mondale because as a senator vote time to increase taxis now believe that problem have not be that anybody in country be undertaxed be that government be overfe and think that most of people this be why have a 25-percent tax cut across the board which maintain the same progressivity of tax structure in the bracket on up and as a matter of fact just so happen that in the quirk of administer these taxis those above|$50,000 actually do not get quite as big a tax cut percentage wise as do those from down from down those people pay third of the taxis and those people get third of the tax cut now the social|security tax of indeed be a tax that hit people in the low bracket the hard have feature have several tax increase phase in over a period of time there be more yet to come between|now|and|1989 at the same time every year increase the amount of money virtually every year there may have be or that be skip in there that be subject to that tax today be up to of earning that be subject to the payroll tax for social|security and that tax there be no deduction so a person make anywhere from pay that tax on the full gross earning that have after have already pay an income tax on that same amount of money now do not think that to try and say that be tax the rich and not the other way around just do not work out that way the system be still where be with regard to the progressivity as have say and that have not be change but if take in number of dollar instead of percentage yes could say well that person get time as much as this other person yes but pay time as much also but if take in percentage then find out that be fair and equitable across the board mr. barnes think catch mr. president a glimmer of a strong statement there in answer than have make before think the operative position have before be that would only raise taxis in a second term as a last resort and think say flatly that be not go to raise taxis be that what mean to say that will not — that will flatly not raise taxis in second term as president the president yes have used—"last resort would always be with if get the government down to the low level that could say could not go any low and still perform the service for the people and if the recovery be so complete that know be get the ultimate amount of revenue that could get through that growth and there be still some slight difference there between those line then have say once that yes would have to then look to see if taxis should not be adjust do not foresee those thing happen so say with great confidence be not go to go for a tax with regard to assail mr. bush about tax problem and the difference from the tax once pay and then the later tax pay think if look at the deduction there be great legal expense in there — have to do possibly with the sale of home and have to do with setting up of a blind trust all of those be legally deduction deductible in compute tax and be a thing with ms. walters mr. mondale here go again be time for rebuttal mr. mondale well first of all give the benefit of the doubt on the house deal be just talk about the that pay and that be what be happen all over this country with wealthy americans have get so many loophole do not have to pay much in taxis now mr. president say there go again right the president yes mr. mondale remember the last time say that the president mm hmm mr. mondale say when president carter say that be go to cut medicare and say oh no there go again mr. president and what do do right after the election go out and try to cut out of medicare and so when say there go again"—people remember this know laughter and people will remember that sign the big tax increase in the history of california and the big tax increase in the history of the|united|state and what be go to do have get a deficit can not wish away will not slow defense spending refuse to do ms. walters mr. mondale be afraid time be up mr. mondale sorry ms. walters mr. president the president yes with regard to medicare no but be time for to say that medicare be in pretty much the same condition that social|security be and something be go to have to be do in the|next|several|years to make fiscally sound and no never propose any should come out of medicare have propose that the program must treat with that particular problem and maybe part of that problem be because during the|4|years|of|the carter mondale administration medical cost in this country go up ms. walters all right fine the president give back some of that time laughter ms. walters can not keep go back for other rebuttal there will be time later now go to final round the way thing stand now have time for only|two set of question and by lot will be jim and diane and will start with jim|wieghart social|welfare|program mr. wieghart mr. president the economic recovery be real but uneven the|census|bureau just|a|month|ago report that there be more people live under poverty now a|million more people live under than when take office there have be a number of study include study by the|urban|institute and other nonpolitical organization that say that the impact of the tax and budget cut and economic policy have impact severely on certain class of americans — work mother head of household minority group elderly poor in fact be say the rich be get rich and the poor be get poor under policy what relief can offer to the work poor to the minority and to the woman head of household who have bear the brunt of these economic program what can offer in the future in next term the president well some of those fact and figure just do not stand up yes there have be an increase in poverty but be a low rate of increase than be in the|preceding|years before get here have begin to decline but be still go up on the other hand woman head of household single woman head of household have for the first time there be be a turndown in the rate of poverty for have find also in study that in this increase in poverty all have to do with private earning have nothing to do with the transfer of payment from government by way of many program be spend now more on food for the hungry in all the various type of program than be spend in be spend a third more on all of the — well all of the program of human service have more people receive food stamp than be ever receive more be receive — even though take off the food stamp roll because be make an income that be above anything that warrant fellow citizen have to support find people make of the poverty level be get government benefit have set a line at so that can direct that aid down to the truly needy some time ago mr. mondale say something about education and college student and help of that kind half out of of the full time college student in the|united|state be receive some form of federal aid but there again find people that there under the previous administration family that have no limit to income be still eligible for low interest college loan do not think that be right and so have set a standard that those loan and those grant be direct to the people who otherwise could not go to college family income be so low so there be a host of other figure that reveal that the grant program be great than have ever be take care of more people than ever have elderly citizen who be live in the low of earnings—7.7 have move up into another bracket since administration take over leave only|5|million of the elderly in that bracket when there have be mr. wieghart mr. president in a visit to texas — in brownsville believe be in the rio grande valley do observe that the economic recovery be uneven the president yes mr. wieghart in that particular area of texas unemployment be over whereas statewide be the low in the country believe—5.6 percent and make the comment however that man do not live by bread alone what do mean by that comment and if interpret correctly would be a comment more address to the affluent who obviously can look beyond just the bread need to sustain with wherewithal the president that have nothing to do with the other thing of talk about need or anything remember distinctly be segue into another subject be talk about the thing that have be accomplish and that be refer to the revival of patriotism and optimism the new spirit that be find all over america and be a wonderful thing to see when get out there among the people so that be the only place that that be use do avoid be afraid in previous answer also the idea of uneven yes there be no way that the recovery be even across the country just as in the depth of the recession there be some part of the country that be bad off but some that do not even feel the pain of the recession be not go to rest and not go to be happy until every person in this country who want a job can have until the recovery be complete across the country mr. wieghart mr. mondale as can gather from the question to the president the celebrated war|on|poverty obviously do not end the problem of poverty although may have dent the poor and the homeless and the disadvantaged be still with what should the|federal|government 's role be to turn back the growth in the number of people live below the poverty level which be now in the|united|state and to help deal with the structural unemployment problem that the president be refer to in an uneven recovery mr. mondale number have get to get the debt down to get the interest rate down so the economy will grow and people will be employ number have to work with city and other to help generate economic growth in those community through do not mind those enterprise zone let try but not as a substitute for the other certainly education and training be crucial if these young americans do not have the skill that make attractive to employee be not go to get job the next thing be to try to get more entrepreneurship in business within the reach of minority so that these business be locate in the community in which be find the other thing be need the business community as well as government heavily involve in these community to try to get economic growth there be no question that the poor be bad off think the president genuinely believe that be well off but the figure show that more people be below the poverty line than how can cut school lunch how can cut student assistance how can cut housing how can cut disability benefit how can do all of these thing and then the people receive for example the disabled who have no alternative how be go to do better do not know now need a tight budget but there be no question that this administration have single out thing that affect the most vulnerable in american life and be hurt final point if may there be another part of the lopsided economy that be in today and that be that these heavy deficit have kill export and be swamp the nation with cheap import be now of import job lose and farmer be have their|worst|year that be another reason to get the deficit down mr. wieghart mr. mondale be possible that the vast majority of americans who appear to be prosperous have lose interest in the kind of program be discuss to help those less privileged than be mr. mondale think the american people want to make certain that that dollar be wisely spend think stand for civil right know be all for education in science and training which strongly support want these young people to have a chance to get job and the rest think the business community want to get involve think be ask for new and creative way to try to reach with everyone involve think that be part of think also that the american people want a balanced program that give long term growth so that be not have to take money that be desperate to and family and give to someone else be opposed to that too ms. walters and now be time for rebuttal for this period mr. president the president yes the connection that be be make again between the deficit and the interest rate there be no connection between there be a connection between interest rate and inflation but would call to attention that in while be operate still on the carter mondale budget that inherit that the interest rate come down from down toward the 12|or|13 figure and while be come down the deficit have start great increase be go up now if there be a connection think that there would be a different parallel between deficit get large and interest rate go down the interest rate be base on inflation and right now have to tell do not think there be any excuse for the interest rate be as high as be because have bring inflation down so low think can only be that be anticipate or hope expect not hope that maybe do not have a control of inflation and be go to go back up again well be not go to go back up be go to see that do not and have not get time to answer with regard to the disabled ms. walters thank mr. president mr. mondale mr. mondale mr. president if hear correctly say that these deficit do not have anything to do with interest rate will grant that interest rate be too high in and can have another debate as to why energy price and so on there be no way of gloss around that but when these huge deficit go in place in what be call the real interest rate the spread between inflation and what a loan cost double and that be still the case today and the result be interest cost that have never be see before in term of real charge and be attributable to the deficit everybody every economist every businessman believe that own council|of|economic|adviser mr feldstein in report tell that every chairman of the|finance|and|ways|and|means|committee republican leader in the senate and the house be tell that that deficit be ruin the long term hope for this economy be cause high interest rate be ruin in trade be give the high small business failure in the economy be start downhill with housing failure ms. walters thank mr. mondale be both very obedient have to give credit for that now start final round of question do want to have time for rebuttal start with diane — diane|sawyer presidential campaign ms. sawyer since be reach the end of the question period and since in every presidential campaign the candidate tend to complain that the opposition candidate be not hold accountable for what or say let give the chance to do that mr. mondale begin with what do think the most outrageous thing be opponent say in this debate tonight laughter mr. mondale do want to give some suggestion laughter be go to use time a little differently be go to give the president some credit think the president have do some thing to raise the sense of spirit morale good feeling in this country and be entitle to credit for that what think need however be not just that but to move forward not just congratulate but challenge to get on with the business of deal with america 's problem think in education when lecture the country about the importance of discipline do not like at first but think help a little bit but now need both that kind of discipline and the resource and the consistent leadership that allow this country to catch up in education and science and training like president reagan and this be not personal — there be deep difference about future and that be the basis of campaign ms. sawyer follow up in a similar vein then what remain question would most like to see opponent force to answer mr. mondale without any doubt have stand up and tell the american people that that deficit must come down and have do what no candidate for president have ever do tell before the election what would do mr. reagan as see tonight president reagan take the position will disappear by magic be once call voodoo economic wish the president would say yes the cbo be right yes have a deficit this be how be go to get do do not talk about growth because even though need growth that be not help be go to go in the other direction as have estimate and give a plan what will cut whose taxis will raise will finally touch that defense budget be go to go after social|security and medicare and student assistance and the handicapped again as do last time if would just tell what be go to do then the american people could compare plan for the future with plan and that be the way should be the american people would be in charge ms. sawyer mr. president the most outrageous thing opponent have say in the debate tonight the president well now have to start with a smile since kind word to will tell what think have be the most outrageous thing in political dialog both in this campaign and the one in and that be the continue discussion and claim that somehow be the villain who be go to pull the social|security check out from those people who be dependent on and why think be outrageous first of all be not true but why be outrageous be because for political advantage every time do that scare million of senior citizen who be totally dependent on social|security have no place else to turn and have to live and go to bed at night thinking be this true be someone go to take check away from and leave destitute and do not think that that should be a part of political dialog now to — still just have a minute here ms. walters have more time the president oh i— ms. walters can keep go the president okay all right now social|security let lay to rest once and for all tell never would do such a thing but tell also now social|security have nothing to do with the deficit social|security be totally fund by the payroll tax levy on employer and employee if reduce the out go of social|security that money would not go into the general fund to reduce a deficit would go into so social|security have nothing to do with balance a budget or erase or lower the deficit now again to get to whether be depend on magic think have talk in straight economic term about a program of recovery that be tell would not work and then after work be tell that lower taxis would increase inflation and none of these thing happen be work and be go to continue on that same line as to what may do and find in further saving cut no be not go to starve the hungry but have specific recommendation from a commission of more|than|2,000 business people in this country through the|grace|commission that be study right now and have already implement of that be recommendation as to how to make government more efficient more economic ms. sawyer and to keep even what remain question would most like to see opponent force to answer the president why the deficit be so much of a problem for now but that in when the deficit be and everyone be panic about that say no that think ought to be big because a big deficit would stimulate the economy and would help do away with unemployment in make similar statement the same effect that the deficit there be nothing wrong with have deficit remember there be in debt before get here that be get to be pay by child and grandchild too if do not do and be hope can start some payment on before get through here that be why want another|4|year ms. walters well have time now if would like to answer the president 's question or whatever rebuttal mr. mondale well have just finish almost the whole debate and the american people do not have the slight clue about what president reagan will do about these deficit laughter and yet that be the most important single issue of time do support the measure that tell about because be in a deep recession and need some stimulation but will say as a democrat be a real piker mr. president in run a deficit all|year this administration seem to run that every|morning and the result be exactly what see this economy be start to run downhill housing be off last report on new purchase be the low since growth be a|little|over|3|percent now many people be predict a recession and the flow of import into this country be swamp the american people have get to deal with this problem and those of who want to be president should tell now what be go to do so can make a judgment ms. walters thank very much must stop now want to give time for closing statement be indeed time for that from each of will begin with president reagan oh be sorry mr. reagan have rebuttal and just cut off because time be go have a chance now for rebuttal before closing statement be that correct the president no may as well just go with- ms. walters do want to go with your— the president do not think so be all confused now ms. walters technically do have little voice that come in ear laughter do not get those same voice be not hear from here i'm hear from here the president all right ms. walters have waive rebuttal can go with closing statement closing statement the president well will include in that ms. walters okay the president four|years|ago in similar circumstance to this ask the american people a question ask be well off than be the answer to that obviously be no and as the result be elect to this office and promise a new beginning now maybe be expect to ask that same question again be not go to because think that all of or not everyone those people that be in those pocket of poverty and have not catch up could not answer the way would want to — but think that most of the people in this country would say yes be well off than be the question think should be enlarge be america better off than be and believe the answer to that have to also be yes promise a new beginning so far be only a beginning if the job be finish may have think twice about seek reelection for this job but now have an economy that for the first time well let put this way in the|first|half|of|1980 gross national product be down a|minus|3.7|percent the|first|half|of|'84 be up 8|1/2|percent productivity in the|first|half|of|1980 be down a minus|2|percent today be up a plus personal earning after taxis per capita have go up almost|$3,000 in these|4|year in a person with a fixed income of be above the poverty line and this maybe explain why there be the number still in poverty by that same person be below the poverty line have restore much of economy with regard to business investment be high than have be since so there seem to be no shortage of investment capital have as say cut the taxis but have reduce inflation and for now have stay down there not at double digit but in the range of or below believe that have also promise that would make country more secure yes have an increase in the defense budget but back then have plane that could not fly for lack of spare part or pilot have navy vessel that could not leave harbor because of lack of crew or again lack of spare part today be well on way to a navy have at present have — military the morale be high think the people should understand that third of the defense budget pay for pay and salary or pay and pension and then add to that food and wardrobe and all the other thing and only have a small portion go for weapon but be determine that if ever man be call on should have the good that can provide in the manner of tool and weapon there have be reference to expensive spare part hammer cost well be the one who find those think have give the american people back spirit think there be an optimism in the land and a patriotism and think that be in a position once again to heed the word of who say have in power to begin the world over again ms. walters thank mr. reagan mr. mondale the closing word be now yours mr. mondale want to thank the|league|of|women|voter and the city of louisville for host this evening 's debate want to thank president reagan for agree to debate do not have to and do and all appreciate the president 's favorite question be be better off well if be wealthy be well off if be middle income be about where be and if be modest income be bad off that be what the economist tell but be that really the question that should be ask be not the real question be will be well off will child be well off be build the future that this nation need believe that if ask those question that bear on future not just congratulate but challenge to solve those problem will see that need new leadership be well of with this arm race will be well off if start this star war escalation into the heaven be better off when de emphasize value in human right be better off when load child with this fantastic debt would father and mother feel proud of if load child with debt like this nation be now over a|trillion|dollars on the shoulder of child can say really say that will be well off when pull away from sort of that basic american instinct of decency and fairness would rather lose a campaign about decency than win a campaign about self interest do not think this nation be compose of people who care only for and when seek to assault social|security and medicare as the record show do think that be mean spirited when terminate desperate hopeless defenseless americans who be on disability confused and unable to defend and just lay out on the street as do for 4|year do not think that be what america be all about america be a fair society and be not right that vice president bush pay less in taxis than the janitor who help believe there be fundamental fairness cry out that need to be achieve in tax system believe that will be well off if protect this environment and contrary to what the president say think record on the environment be inexcusable and often shameful these law be not be enforce have not be enforce and the public health and the air and the water be pay the price that be not fair for future think future require a president to lead in an all out search to advance education learning and science and training because this world be more complex and be be press harder all the time believe in open door win the olympics in part because have have civil right law and the law that prohibit discrimination against woman have be for those effort all life the president 's record be quite different the question be future president kennedy once say in response to similar argument be great but can be great can be well if face future rejoice in strength face

campaign and america 's future have be campaign long enough to know that a political party and leadership can not change color in four|days will not and no matter how hard try opponent do not in san|francisco do not discover value in a poll take a|week before the convention and do not set a weathervane on top of the|golden|gate|bridge before start talk about the american family the choice this|year be not just between different personality or between political party be between different vision of the future fundamentally different way of govern government of pessimism fear and limit or

have pass by learn from the past and strive to change by boldly chart a new course for the future live by promise the big the well offer prove workable answer opponent begin this campaign hope that america have a poor memory well let take on a little stroll down memory lane let remind of how a inflation rate in become back to back year of double digit inflation the bad since world|war — punish the poor and the elderly young couple strive to start new life and work people struggle to make end meet inflation be not some plague bear on the wind be a deliberate part of official economic policy need say to maintain prosperity do not tell that with would come the high interest rate since the|civil|war as average monthly mortgage payment more than double home building nearly grind to a halt tens|of|thousand of carpenter and other be throw out of work and who control both houses of the congress and the executive branch at that time not not campaign across america in see evidence everywhere of industrial decline and in rural america farmer ' cost be drive up by inflation be devastate by a wrongheaded grain embargo and be force to borrow money at exorbitant interest rate just to get by and many of do not get by farmer have to fight insect weather and the marketplace should not have to fight own government the high interest rate of be not talk about in san|francisco but how about taxis be talk about in san|francisco will|roger once say never meet a man do not like well if could paraphrase will friend in the other party have never meet a tax do not like or hike under policy tax rate have go up time as much for family with child as have for everyone else over these|past|three|decade in just|the|five|year before come into office taxis roughly double some who speak so loudly in san|francisco of fairness be among those who bring about the big single individual tax increase in history in call for a series of increase in the social|security payroll tax and in the amount of pay subject to that tax the bill pass call for additional increase between|now|and|1990 increase that bear down hardest on those at the low income level the|census|bureau confirm that because of the tax law inherit the number of household at or below the poverty level pay federal income tax more than double between|1980|and|1982 well receive some relief in when across the board tax cut be fully in place and will get more help when indexing go into effect this|january opponent have repeatedly advocate eliminate indexing would that really hurt the rich no because the rich be already in the top bracket but those work man and woman who depend on a cost of live adjustment just to keep abreast of inflation would find push into high tax bracket and would not even be able to keep even with inflation because would be pay a high income tax that be bracket creep and opponent be for and be against be up to to see that all fellow citizen understand that confiscatory taxis costly social experiment and economic tinkering be not just the policy of a single administration for the|26|years|prior|to|january|of|1981 the opposition party control both houses|of|congress every spending bill and every tax for more|than|a|quarter|of|a|century have be of doing about|a|decade|ago say federal spending be out of control so pass a budget control act and in the|next|five|years run up deficit of some control in gain control of the senate and the executive branch with the help of some concerned democrats in the house start a policy of tighten the federal budget instead of the family budget a task force chair by vice president george|bush — the fine vice president this country have ever have eliminate unnecessary regulation that have be strangle business and industry and while have friend down memory lane maybe would like to recall a gimmick design for campaign as president ford tell the|night before last add the unemployment and inflation rate get what call a misery index in come to declare the incumbent have no right to seek reelection with that kind of a misery index well in the election do not mention the misery index possibly because be then and do know something will not mention in this election either be down to and drop by nearly every measure the position of poor americans worsen under the leadership of opponent teenage drug use out of wedlock birth and crime increase dramatically urban neighborhood and school deteriorate those whom government intend to help discover a cycle of dependency that could not be break government become a drug provide temporary relief but addiction as well and let get some fact on the table that opponent do not want to hear the big annual increase in poverty take place between|1978 and each|year in the|first|two|year of administration well should pardon do not put a period in there in the|first|two|year of administration that annual increase fall to and be the|first|year|since|1978 that there be no appreciable increase in poverty at all pour hundreds|of|billions|of|dollar into program in order to make people bad off be irrational and unfair be time end this reliance on the government process and renew faith in the human process in the people decide with that the economic crisis be not cause by the fact that live too well government live too well be time for tax increase to be an act of last resort not of first resort the people tell the liberal leadership in washington try shrink the size of government before shrink the size of paycheck government be also in serious trouble abroad

all americans be lose the confidence and optimism about the future that have make unique in the world parent be begin to doubt that child would have the well life that have be the dream of every american generation can all be proud that pessimism be end america be come back and be more confident than ever about the future tonight thank the citizen of the|united|state whose faith and unwillingness to give up on or this country save all together begin the task of control the size and activity of the government by reduce the growth of spending while pass a tax program to provide

too strong be weakness that invite adventurous adversary to make mistaken judgment america be the most peaceful least warlike nation in modern history be not the cause of all the ill of the world be a patient and generous people but for the sake of freedom and that of other can not permit reserve to be confuse with a lack of resolve ten|months|ago display this resolve in a mission to rescue american student on the imprison island of grenada democratic candidate have suggest that this could be liken to the soviet invasion of afghanistan the crushing of human right in poland or the genocide in cambodia could imagine harry|truman john|kennedy hubert|humphrey or scoop|jackson make such a shocking comparison of fine young man lose life on grenada and to even remotely compare sacrifice to the murderous action take place in afghanistan be unconscionable there be some obvious and important difference first be invite in by east|caribbean|state do anyone seriously believe the people of or afghanistan invite the russians second there be hundreds|of|thousand of soviets occupy captive nation across the world today combat troop have come home student be safe and freedom be what leave behind in grenada there be some who have forget why have a military be not to promote war be to be prepare for peace there be a sign over the entrance to in washington|state and that sign say all peace be profession next administration all right hear and that administration will be commit to complete the unfinished agenda that have place before the congress and the nation be an agenda which call upon the national democratic leadership to cease obstructionist way have hear a lot about deficit this|year from those on the other side of the aisle well should be expert on budget deficit

semitism or bigotry of any kind many people be welcome in house but not the bigot believe in the uniqueness of each individual believe in the sacredness of human life for some time now have all fall into a pattern of describe choice as left or right be become standard rhetoric in discussion of political philosophy but be that really an accurate description of the choice before go back a|few|year to the origin of the term and see where left or right would take if continue far enough in either direction stalin hitler one would take to communist totalitarianism the other to the totalitarianism of hitler be not choice really not of left or right but of up or down down through the welfare state to statism to more and more government largesse accompany always by more government authority less

the safe harbor of freedom progress and hope do these thing will open wide the gate of opportunity provide great security for all with no barrier of bigotry or discrimination the key to a|dynamic|decade be vigorous economic growth first great goal may well begin with common sense in federal budgeting government spend no more than government take in must bring federal deficit down but how do that make all the difference can begin by limit the size and scope of government under the leadership of vice president bush have reduce the growth of federal regulation by more|than|25|percent and cut well|over|300|million|hours of government require paperwork each|year this will save the public more|than|$150|billion over the|next|10|year the grace commission have give some|2,500 recommendation for reduce wasteful spending and be be examine throughout the administration federal spending growth have be cut from in to less|than|half of that today and have already achieve over|$300|billion in budget saving for the period of to ' but that be only a little more than half of what seek government be still spend too large a percentage of the total economy now some insist that any further budget saving must be obtain by reduce the portion spend on defense this ignore the fact that national defense be solely the responsibility of the federal government indeed be prime responsibility and yet defense spending be less|than|a|third of the total budget during the|year of president kennedy and of the|years|before that defense be almost|half the total budget and then come several|year in which military capability be allow to deteriorate to a very dangerous degree be just now restore through the essential modernization of conventional and strategic force capability to meet present and future security need dare not shirk responsibility to keep america free secure and at peace the|last|decade see domestic spending surge literally out of control but the basis for such spending have be lay in previous|years a pattern of overspending have be in place for half|a|century as the national debt grow be tell not to worry that owe to now know that deficit be a cause for worry but there be a difference of opinion as to whether taxis should be increase spending cut or some of both fear be express that government borrowing to fund the deficit could inhibit the economic recovery by take capital need for business and industrial expansion well think that debate be miss an important point whether government borrow or increase taxis will be take the same amount of money from the private sector and either way that be too much simple fairness dictate that government must not raise taxis on family struggle to pay bill the root of the problem be that government 's share be more than can afford if be to have a sound economy must bring down the deficit to ensure continue economic growth in the budget that will submit on february|1 will recommend measure that will reduce the deficit over many of these will be unfinished business from last|year 's budget some could be enact quickly if could join in a serious effort to address this problem speak today with speaker of the house o'neill senate majority leader baker senate minority leader|byrd and house minority leader michel ask if would designate congressional representative to meet with representative of the administration to try to reach prompt agreement on a bipartisan deficit reduction plan know would take a long hard struggle to agree on a full scale plan so what have propose be that first see if can agree on a down payment now believe there be basis for such an agreement that could reduce the deficit by about|$100|billion over could focus on some of the less contentious spending cut that be still pende before the congress these could be combine with measure to close certain tax loophole measure that the|treasury|department have previously say to be worthy of support in addition could examine the possibility of achieve further outlay saving base on the work of the|grace|commission if the congressional leadership be willing representative will be prepared to meet with at the early possible time would hope the leadership may agree on an expedite timetable in which to develop and enact that down payment but a down payment alone be not enough to break out of the deficit problem could help start on the right path yet must do more so propose that begin explore how together can make structural reform to curb the build in growth of spending also propose improvement in the budgeting process some|43 of state grant governor the right to veto individual item in appropriation bill without have to veto the entire bill california be of those state as governor find this line item veto be a powerful tool against wasteful or extravagant spending work in state let put to work in washington for all the people would be most effective if do by constitutional amendment the majority of americans approve of such an amendment just as and approve of an amendment mandate a balanced federal budget many state also have this protection in constitution to talk of meet the present situation by increase taxis be a band aid solution which do nothing to cure an illness that be be come on for half|a|century to say nothing of the fact that pose a real threat to economic recovery let remember that a substantial amount of income tax be presently owe and not pay by people in the underground economy would be immoral to make those who be pay taxis pay more to compensate for those who be not pay share there be a well way let go forward with an historic reform for fairness simplicity and incentive for growth be ask secretary don|regan for a plan for action to simplify the entire tax code so all taxpayer big and small be treat more fairly and believe such a plan could result in that underground economy be bring into the sunlight of honest tax compliance and could make the tax base broader so personal tax rate could come down not go up have ask that specific recommendation consistent with those objective be present to by december|1984 second great goal be to build on america 's pioneer laughter —i say something funny laughter say america 's next frontier and that be to develop that frontier a sparkle economy spur initiative sunrise industry and make old

nato line divide the free world from the communist bloc and the same could be say for asia but in spite of or maybe because of a flurry of story about place like nicaragua and el|salvador and yes some concerted propaganda many of find hard to believe have a stake in problem involve those country too many have think of central|america as just that place way down below mexico that can not possibly constitute a threat to well being and that be why have ask for this session central|america 's problem do directly affect the security and the well being of own people and central|america be much close to the|united|state than many of the world troublespot that concern so work to restore own economy can not afford to lose sight of neighbor to the south el|salvador be near to texas than texas

importance of central|america border as do on the caribbean lifeline to the outside world third of all foreign trade and petroleum pass through the|panama|canal and the caribbean in a european crisis

of a population of less|than|5|million the world should respect this courage and not allow to be belittle or forget and again say in good conscience can never turn back on that the democratic political party and faction in be come together around the common goal of seek a political solution to country 's problem new national election will be hold this|year and will be open to all political party the government have invite the guerrilla to participate in the election and be prepare an amnesty law the people of be earn freedom and deserve moral and material support to protect yes there be still major problem regard human right the criminal justice system and violence against noncombatant and like the rest of central|america el|salvador also face severe economic problem but in addition to recession depress price for major agricultural export el|salvador 's economy be be deliberately sabotage tonight in el|salvador — because of ruthless guerrilla attack much of the fertile land can not be cultivate less|than|half the rolling stock of the railway remain operational bridge water facility telephone and electric system have be destroy and damage in 22-month period there be interruption of electrical power region be without electricity for a|third of the year think secretary of state|shultz put very well the other day unable to win the free loyalty of el|salvador 's people the guerrilla say be deliberately and systematically deprive of food water transportation light sanitation and job and these be the people who claim want to help the common people do not want election because know would be defeat but as the previous election show the salvadoran people 's desire for democracy will not be defeat the guerrilla be not embattle peasant arm with musket be professional sometimes with well training and weaponry than the government 's soldier the salvadoran battalion that have receive u.s. training have be conduct well on the battlefield and with the civilian population but so far have only provide enough money to train salvadoran soldier out of few than the number of guerrilla that be train by nicaragua and cuba and let set the record straight on nicaragua a country next to el|salvador in when the new government take over in nicaragua after a revolution which overthrow the authoritarian rule of somoza everyone hope for the growth of democracy in the|united|state do too by january|of|1981 emergency relief and recovery aid to nicaragua total more than provide by any other developed country in fact in the|first|2|years of sandinista rule directly or indirectly send time more aid to nicaragua than have in the|2|year prior to the revolution can anyone doubt the generosity and the good faith of the american people these be hardly the action of a nation implacably hostile to nicaragua yet the|government|of|nicaragua have treat as an enemy have reject repeat peace effort have break promise to to the|organization|of|american|states and most important of all to the people of nicaragua no sooner be victory achieve than a small clique oust other who have be part of the revolution from have any voice in the government humberto|ortega the minister of defense declare marxism leninism would be guide and so be the government of nicaragua have impose a new dictatorship have refuse to hold the election promise have seize control of most medium and subject all medium to heavy prior censorship deny the bishop and priest of the|roman|catholic|church the right to say mass on radio during holy|week insult and mock the pope have drive the|miskito|indian from homeland burn village destroy crop and force into involuntary internment camp far from home have move against the private sector and free labor union condone mob action against nicaragua 's independent human right commission and drive the director of that commission into exile in short after all these act of repression by the government be any wonder that opposition have form contrary to propaganda the opponent of the sandinistas be not diehard supporter of the previous somoza regime in fact many be anti - somoza hero and fight beside the sandinista to bring down the somoza government now have be deny any part in the new government because truly want democracy for nicaragua and still do other be miskito indians fight for home land and life the sandinista revolution in nicaragua turn out to be just an exchange of set of autocratic ruler for another and the people still have no freedom no democratic right and more poverty even bad than predecessor be help cuba and the soviets to destabilize hemisphere meanwhile the government of make every effort to guarantee democracy free labor union freedom of religion and a free press be under attack by guerrilla dedicate to the same philosophy that prevail in nicaragua cuba and yes the|soviet|union violence have be nicaragua 's most important export to the world be the ultimate in hypocrisy for the unelected nicaraguan|government to charge that seek overthrow when be do everything can to bring down the elect government|of|el|salvador thank the guerrilla attack be direct from a headquarters in managua the capital of nicaragua but let be clear as to the american attitude toward the|government|of|nicaragua do not seek overthrow interest be to ensure that do not infect neighbor through the export of subversion and violence purpose in conformity with american and international law be to prevent the flow of arm to honduras guatemala and costa|rica have attempt to have a dialog with the|government|of|nicaragua but persist in effort to spread violence should not and will not protect the|nicaraguan|government from the anger of own people but should through diplomacy offer an alternative and as nicaragua ponder option can and will — with all the resource of diplomacy protect each country of central|america from the danger of war even costa|rica central|america 's old and strong democracy a government so peaceful do not even have an army be the object of bullying and threat from nicaragua 's dictator nicaragua 's neighbor know that sandinista promise of peace nonalliance and nonintervention have not be keep new military basis have be build there be only|13 during the|somoza|year nicaragua 's new army number man support by a militia of be the large army in central|america supplement by cuban military and security adviser be equip with the most modern weapon dozen of soviet make tank sovietbloc truck soviet howitzer anti - aircraft gun plus plane and helicopter there be additional thousand of civilian adviser from cuba the|soviet|union east|germany libya and the plo and be attack because have military trainer in the goal of the professional guerrilla movement in central|america be as simple as be sinister to destabilize the entire region from the|panama|canal to mexico and if doubt beyond this point just consider what cayetano|carpio the now deceased salvadoran guerrilla leader say earlier|this|month carpio say that after el|salvador fall and nicaragua would be arm in arm and struggle for the total liberation of central|america nicaragua 's dictatorial junta who make war and win power operate from basis in honduras and costa|rica like to pretend that be today be attack by force base in honduras the fact be be nicaragua 's government that threaten honduras not the reverse be nicaragua who have move heavy tank close to the border and nicaragua who speak of war be nicaraguan radio that announce on april|8th the creation of a new unified revolutionary coordinate board to push forward the marxist struggle in honduras nicaragua support by weapon and military resource provide by the communist bloc repress own people refuse to make peace and sponsor a guerrilla war against el|salvador president truman 's word be as apt today as be in when too speak before a joint session of the congress at the present moment in world history nearly every nation must choose between alternate way of life the choice be not too often a free one way of life be base upon the will of the majority and be distinguish by free institution representative government free election guarantee of individual liberty freedom of speech and religion and freedom from political oppression the second way of life be base upon the will of a minority forcibly impose upon the majority rely upon terror and oppression a control press and radio fix election and the suppression of personal freedom believe that must be the policy of the|united|state to support free people who be resist attempt subjugation by armed minority or by outside pressure believe that must assist free people to work out own destiny in own way believe that help should be primarily through economic and financial aid which be essential to economic stability and orderly political process collapse of free institution and loss of independence would be disastrous not only for but for the world discouragement and possibly failure would quickly be the lot of neighboring people strive to maintain freedom and independence the country of central|america be small than the nation that prompt president truman 's message but the political and strategic stake be the same will response economic social military be as appropriate and successful as mr. truman 's bold solution to the problem of postwar europe some people have forget the success of those|year and the|decade of peace prosperity and freedom secure some people talk as though the|united|state be incapable of act effectively in international affair without risk war or damage those seek to help be democracy require to remain passive while threat to security and prosperity accumulate must just accept the destabilization of an entire region from the|panama|canal to mexico on southern border must sit by while independent nation of this hemisphere be integrate into the most aggressive empire the modern world have see must wait while central|american be drive from home like the more|than|a|million who have seek refuge out of afghanistan or the 1|1/2|million who have flee indochina or the more|than|a|million cubans who have flee castro 's caribbean utopia must by default leave the people of el|salvador no choice but to flee home create another tragic human exodus do not believe there be a majority in the congress or the country that counsel passivity resignation defeatism in the face of this challenge to freedom and security in own hemisphere thank thank do not believe that a majority of the congress or the country be prepared to stand by passively while the people of central|america be deliver to totalitarianism and be leave vulnerable to new danger only|last|week an official of the|soviet|union reiterate brezhnev 's threat to station nuclear missile in this hemisphere from the|united|state like an echo nicaragua 's commandante|daniel|ortega confirm that if ask country would consider accept those missile understand that today may be have second thought now before go any further let say to those who invoke the memory of vietnam there be no thought of send american combat troop to central|america be not needed— thank and as say be not need and indeed have not be request there all neighbor ask of be assistance in training and arm to protect while build a well free life must continue to encourage peace among the nation of central|america must support the regional effort now underway to promote solution to regional problem can not be certain that the marxist leninist band who believe war be an instrument of politic will be readily discourage be crucial that not become discouraged before do otherwise the region 's freedom will be lose and security damage in way that can hardly be calculate if be to fall what would the consequence be for position in asia europe and for alliance such as nato if the|united|state can not respond to a threat near own border why should europeans or asians believe that be seriously concerned about threat to if the soviets can assume that nothing short of an actual attack on the|united|state will provoke an american response which ally which friend will trust then the congress share both the power and the responsibility for foreign policy tonight ask the congress to join in a bold generous approach to the problem of peace and poverty democracy and dictatorship in the region join in a program that prevent communist victory in the short run but go beyond to produce for the deprived people of the area

other better retain diverse identity respect diverse tradition and institution and third in response to the military challenge from cuba and nicaragua — to deliberate use of force to spread tyranny will support the security of the region 's threaten nation do not view security assistance as an end in but as a shield for democratization economic development and diplomacy no amount of reform will bring peace so long as guerrilla believe will win by force no amount of economic help will suffice if guerrilla unit can destroy road and bridge and power station and crop again and again with impunity but with well training and material help neighbor can hold off the guerrilla and give democratic reform time to take root and fourth will support dialog and negotiation both among the country of the region and within each country the term and condition of participation in election be negotiable costa|rica be a shin example of democracy honduras have make the move from military rule to

fund for key current economic and security program so that the people of central|america can hold the line against externally support aggression in addition be ask for prompt action on the supplemental request in these same area to carry through the|current|fiscal|year and for early and favorable congressional action on request for and finally be ask that the bipartisan consensus which last|year act on the trade and tax provision of the|caribbean|basin|initiative in the house again take the lead to move this vital proposal to the floor of both chambers and as say before the great share of these request be target toward economic and humanitarian aid not military what the administration be ask for on behalf of freedom in central|america be so small so minimal consider what be at stake the total amount request for aid to all of in be about|$600|million that be less than tenth of what americans will spend this|year on coin operate video game in summation say to that tonight there can be no question the national security of all the americas be at stake in central|america if can not defend there can not expect to prevail elsewhere credibility would collapse alliance would crumble and the safety of homeland would be put in jeopardy have a vital interest a moral duty and a solemn responsibility this be not a partisan issue be a question of meet moral responsibility to friend and posterity be a duty that fall on all of the president the congress and the people must perform together who among would wish to bear responsibility for fail to meet shared obligation thank god bless and good night & nbsp & nbsp view transcript transcript fellow americans thank for share time with tonight the subject want to discuss with peace and national security be both timely and important timely because have reach a decision which offer a new hope for child in the|21st|century a decision will tell about in a|few|minutes and important because there be a very big decision that must make for yourself this subject involve the most basic duty that any president and any people share the duty to protect and strengthen the peace at the|beginning|of|this|year submit to the congress a defense budget which reflect good judgment of the good understanding of the expert and specialist who advise about what and ally must do to protect people in the|years|ahead that budget be much more than a long list of number for behind all the number lie america 's ability to prevent the great of human tragedy and preserve free way of life in a sometimes dangerous world be part of a careful long term plan to make america strong again after too many year of neglect and mistake effort to rebuild america 's defense and strengthen the peace begin when request a major increase in the defense program since then the amount of those increase first propose have be reduce by half through improvement in management and procurement and other saving the budget request that be now before the congress have be trim to the limit of safety further deep cut can not be make without seriously endanger the security of the nation the choice be up to the man and woman have elect to the congress and that mean the choice be up to tonight want to explain to what this defense debate be all about and why be convinced that the budget now before the congress be necessary responsible and deserving of support and want to offer hope for the future but first let say what the defense debate be not about be not about spend arithmetic know that in the|last|few|week have be bombard with number and percentage some say need only a increase in defense spending the so call alternate budget back by liberal in the|house|of|representatives would lower the figure to to percent cut defense spending by over the|next|5|years the trouble with all these number be that tell little about the kind of defense program america need or the benefit and security and freedom that defense effort buy for what seem to have be lose in all this debate be the simple truth of how a defense budget be arrive at be not do by decide to spend a certain number of dollar those loud voice that be occasionally hear charge that the government be try to solve a security problem by throw money at be nothing more than noise base on ignorance start by consider what must be do to maintain peace and review all the possible threat against security then a strategy for strengthen peace and defend against those threat must be agree upon and finally defense establishment must be evaluate to see what be necessary to protect against any or all of the potential threat the cost of achieve these end be total up and the result be the budget for national defense there be no logical way that can say let spend less can only say which part of defense measure do believe can do without and still have security against all contingency anyone in the congress who advocate a percentage or a specific dollar cut in defense spending should be make to say what part of defense would eliminate and should be candid enough to acknowledge that cut mean cut commitment to ally or invite great risk or both the defense policy of the|united|state be base on a simple premise the|united|state do not start fight will never be an aggressor maintain strength in order to deter and defend against aggression to preserve freedom and peace since the dawn of the atomic age have seek to reduce the risk of war by maintain a strong deterrent and by seek genuine arm control deterrence mean simply this make sure any adversary who think about attack the|united|state or ally or vital interest conclude that the risk to outweigh any potential gain once understand that will not attack maintain the peace through strength weakness only invite aggression this strategy of deterrence have not change still work but what take to maintain deterrence have change take kind of military force to deter an attack when have far more nuclear weapon than any other power take another kind now that the soviets for example have enough accurate and powerful nuclear weapon to destroy virtually all of missile on the ground now this be not to say that the|soviet|union be plan to make war on nor do believe a war be inevitable quite the contrary but what must be recognize be that security be base on be prepare to meet all threat there be a time when depend on coastal fort and artillery battery because with the weaponry of that|day any attack would have have to come by sea well this be a different world and defense must be base on recognition and awareness of the weaponry possess by other nation in the nuclear age can not afford to believe that will never be threaten there have be world war in lifetime do not start and indeed do everything could to avoid be draw into but be ill prepared for both have be better prepare peace may have be preserve for the|soviet|union have be accumulate enormous military might do not stop when force exceed all requirement of a legitimate defensive capability and have not stop now during the soviets have build up a massive arsenal of new strategic nuclear weapon weapon that can strike directly at the|united|state as an example the|united|state introduce last new intercontinental ballistic missile the minute|man|iii in and be now dismantle even old titan missile but what have the|soviet|union do in these|intervening|years well since the|soviet|union have build new class of icbm 's and upgrade these time as a result missile be much more powerful and accurate than be and continue to develop more while our be increasingly obsolete the same thing have happen in other area over the same period the|soviet|union build new class of submarine launch ballistic missile and over|60 new missile submarine build new type of submarine missile and actually withdraw submarine from strategic mission the|soviet|union build over new backfire bomber and brand new blackjack bomber be now under development have not build a new long range bomber since b-52 's be deploy about|a|quarter of a century ago and have already retire several|hundred of those because of old age indeed despite what many people think strategic force only cost about|15|percent of the defense budget another example of what be happen in the soviets have intermediate range nuclear missile base on land and be begin to add the ss-20—a new highly accurate mobile missile with warhead have none since then the soviet have strengthen lead by the|end|of|1979 when soviet leader brezhnev declare a balance now exist the soviets have over|800 warhead still have none a|year|ago|this|month mr. brezhnev pledge a moratorium or freeze on ss-20 deployment but by last|august warhead have become more|than|1,200 still have none some freeze at this time soviet defense minister ustinov announce approximate parity of force continue to exist but the soviets be still add an average of new warhead a|week and now have these warhead can reach target in a matter of a|few|minute still have none so far seem that the soviet definition of parity be a box score of to nothing in favor so together with nato ally decide in to deploy new weapon begin this|year as a deterrent to ss—20 's and as an incentive to the|soviet|union to meet in serious arm control negotiation will begin that deployment late|this|year at the same time however be willing to cancel program if the soviets will dismantle this be what have call a plan the soviets be now at the negotiating table and think be fair to say that without plan deployment would not be there now let consider conventional force since the|united|state have produce tactical combat aircraft by contrast the|soviet|union have produce twice as many when look at attack submarine the|united|state have produce while the|soviet|union have produce for armored vehicle include tank have produce the|soviet|union have produce in favor finally with artillery have produce artillery and rocket launcher while the soviet have produce more than staggering ratio there be a time when be able to offset superior soviet number with high quality but today be build weapon as sophisticated and modern as own as the soviets have increase military power have be embolden to extend that power be spread military influence in way that can directly challenge vital interest and those of ally the following aerial photograph most of secret until now illustrate this point in a crucial area very close to home and the|caribbean|basin be not dramatic photograph but think help give a well understanding of what be talk about this soviet intelligence collection facility from coast be the large of kind in the world the acre and acre of antennae field and intelligence monitor be target on key u.s. military installation and sensitive activity the installation in lourdes cuba be man by soviet technician and the satellite ground station allow instant communication with moscow this 28-square mile facility have grow by more|than|60|percent in size and capability during the|past|decade in western cuba see this military airfield and complement of modern soviet build mig-23 aircraft the|soviet|union use this cuban airfield for own long range reconnaissance mission and earlier|this|month modern soviet antisubmarine warfare aircraft begin operate from during the|past|2|years the level of soviet arm export to cuba can only be compare to the level reach during the cuban missile crisis 20|years|ago this third photo which be the only in this series that have be previously make public show soviet military hardware that have make way to central|america this airfield with mi-8 helicopter anti - aircraft gun and protect fighter site be of a number of military facility in nicaragua which have receive soviet equipment funnel through cuba and reflect the massive military buildup go on in that country on the small island of grenada at the southern end of the caribbean chain the cubans with soviet financing and backing be in the process of build an airfield with a runway grenada do not even have an air force who be intend for the caribbean be a very important passageway for international commerce and military line of communication more|than|half of all american oil import now pass through the caribbean the rapid buildup of grenada 's military potential be unrelated to any conceivable threat to this island country of under people and totally at odd with the pattern of other eastern caribbean|state most of which be unarmed the soviet cuban militarization of grenada in short can only be see as power projection into the region and be in this important economic and strategic area that be try to help the|governments|of costa|rica honduras and other in struggle for democracy against guerrilla support through cuba and nicaragua these picture only tell a small part of the story wish could show more without compromise most sensitive intelligence source and method but the|soviet|union be also support cuban military force in angola and ethiopia have basis in ethiopia and south|yemen near the persian|gulf oil field have take over the port that build at cam|ranh|bay in vietnam and now for the first time in history the soviet navy be a force to be reckon with in the|south|pacific some people may still ask would the soviets ever use formidable military power well again can afford to believe will not there be afghanistan and in poland the soviets deny the will of the people and in so do demonstrate to the world how military power could also be use to intimidate the final fact be that the|soviet|union be acquire what can only be consider an offensive military force have continue to build far more intercontinental ballistic missile than could possibly need simply to deter an attack conventional force be train and equip not so much to defend against an attack as be to permit sudden surprise offensive of own nato ally have assume a great defense burden include the military draft in most country be work with and other friend around the world to do more defensive strategy mean need military force that can move very quickly force that be train and ready to respond to any emergency every item in defense program ship tank plane fund for training and spare part be intend for all important purpose to keep the peace unfortunately a|decade of neglect military force have call into question ability to do that when take office in january|1981 be appal by what find american plane that could not fly and american ship that could not sail for lack of spare part and train personnel and insufficient fuel and ammunition for essential training the inevitable result of all this be poor morale in armed|force difficulty in recruit the bright young americans to wear the uniform and difficulty in convince most experienced military personnel to stay on there be a real question then about how well could meet a crisis and be obvious that have to begin a major modernization program to ensure could deter aggression and preserve the peace in the|years|ahead have to move immediately to improve the basic readiness and stay power of conventional force so could meet — and therefore help deter — a crisis have to make up for lost|year of investment by move forward with a long term plan to prepare force to counter the military capability adversary be develop for the future know that all of want peace and so do i. know too that many of seriously believe that a nuclear freeze would further the cause of peace but a freeze now would make less not more secure and would raise not reduce the risk of war would be largely unverifiable and would seriously undercut negotiation on arm reduction would reward the soviets for massive military buildup while prevent from modernize aging and increasingly vulnerable force with present margin of superiority why should agree to arm reduction know that be prohibit from catch up believe be not pleasant for someone who have come to washington determine to reduce government spending but have to move forward with the task of repair defense or would lose ability to deter conflict now and in the future have to demonstrate to any adversary that aggression could not succeed and that the only real solution be substantial equitable and effectively verifiable arm reduction the kind be work for right now in geneva thank to strong support and bipartisan support from the congress begin to turn thing around already be see some very encouraging result quality recruitment and retention be up dramatically more high school graduate be choose military career and more experienced career personnel be choose to stay man and woman in uniform at last be get the tool and training need to do job ask around today especially among young people and think will find a whole new attitude toward serve country this reflect more than just well pay equipment and leadership the american people have send a signal to these young people that be once again an honor to wear the uniform that be not something measure in a budget but be a very real part of nation 's strength will take longer to build the kind of equipment need to keep peace in the future but have make a good start have not build a new long range bomber for now be build the b-1 have not launch new strategic submarine for now be build trident submarine a year land base missile be increasingly threaten by the many huge new soviet icbm 's be determine how to solve that problem at the same time be work in the start and inf negotiation with the goal of achieve deep reduction in the strategic and intermediate nuclear arsenal of both side have also begin the long need modernization of conventional force the army be get first new tank in the|air|force be modernize be rebuild navy which shrink from about|a|thousand ship in the|late|1960 be to during the 's nation need a superior navy to support military force and vital interest overseas be now on the road to achieve a navy and increase the amphibious capability of marine who be now serve the cause of peace in lebanon and be build a real capability to assist friend in the vitally important indian|ocean and persian|gulf region this add up to a major effort and be not cheap come at a time when there be many other pressure on budget and when the american people have already have to make major sacrifice during the recession but must not be mislead by those who would make defense once again the scapegoat of the federal budget the fact be that in the|past|few|decade have see a dramatic shift in how spend the taxpayer 's dollar back in payment to individual take up of the federal budget for nearly|three|decades these payment steadily increase and this|year will account for of the budget by contrast in defense take up more|than|half of the federal budget by this spending have fall to a low of even with the increase that be request this|year defense will still amount to only|28|percent of the budget the call for cut back the defense budget come in nice simple arithmetic be the same kind of talk that lead the democracy to neglect defense in the 's and invite the tragedy of world|war|ii must not let that grim chapter of history repeat through apathy or neglect this be why be speak to tonight to urge to tell senator and congressmen that know must continue to restore military strength if stop in midstream will send a signal of decline of lessened will to friend and adversary alike free people must voluntarily through open debate and democratic mean meet the challenge that totalitarian pose by compulsion be up to in time to choose and choose wisely between the hard but necessary task of preserve peace and freedom and the temptation to ignore duty and blindly hope for the good while the enemy of freedom grow strong day by day the solution be well within grasp but to reach there be simply no alternative but to continue this|year in this budget to provide the resource need to preserve the peace and guarantee freedom now thus far tonight have share with thought on the problem of national security must face together predecessor in the oval office have appear before on other occasion to describe the threat pose by soviet power and have propose step to address that threat but since the advent of nuclear weapon those step have be increasingly direct toward deterrence of aggression through the promise of retaliation this approach to stability through offensive threat have work and ally have succeed in prevent nuclear war for more|than|three|decade in recent|month however adviser include in particular the|joint|chiefs|of|staff have underscore the necessity to break out of a future that rely solely on offensive retaliation for security over the course of these discussion have become more and more deeply convinced that the human spirit must be capable of rise above deal with other nation and human being by threaten existence feel this way believe must thoroughly examine every opportunity for reduce tension and for introduce great stability into the strategic calculus on both side of the most important contribution can make be of course to lower the level of all arm and particularly nuclear arm be engage right now in several negotiation with the|soviet|union to bring about a mutual reduction of weapon will report to a|week from tomorrow thought on that score but let just say be totally committed to this course if the|soviet|union will join with in effort to achieve major arm reduction will have succeed in stabilize the nuclear balance nevertheless will still be necessary to rely on the specter of retaliation on mutual threat and that be a sad commentary on the human condition would not be well to save life than to avenge be not capable of demonstrate peaceful intention by apply all ability and ingenuity to achieve a truly last stability think be indeed must after careful consultation with adviser include the|joint|chiefs|of|staff believe there be a way let share with a vision of the future which offer hope be that embark on a program to counter the awesome soviet missile threat with measure that be defensive let turn to the very strength in technology that spawn great industrial base and that have give the quality of life enjoy today what if free people could live secure in the knowledge that security do not rest upon the threat of instant u.s. retaliation to deter a soviet attack that could intercept and destroy strategic ballistic missile before reach own soil or that of ally know this be a formidable technical task one that may not be accomplish before yet current technology have attain a level of sophistication where be reasonable for to begin this effort will take year probably decade of effort on many front there will be failure and setback just as there will be success and breakthrough and as proceed must remain constant in preserve the nuclear deterrent and maintain a solid capability for flexible response but be not worth every investment necessary to free the world from the threat of nuclear war know be in the meantime will continue to pursue real reduction in nuclear arm negotiate from a position of strength that can be ensure only by modernize strategic force at the same time must take step to reduce the risk of a conventional military conflict escalate to nuclear war by improve nonnuclear capability america do possess — now — the technology to attain very significant improvement in the effectiveness of conventional nonnuclear force proceed boldly with these new technology can significantly reduce any incentive that the|soviet|union may have to threaten attack against the|united|state or ally as pursue goal of defensive technology recognize that ally rely upon strategic offensive power to deter attack against vital interest and our be inextricably link safety and be and no change in technology can or will alter that reality must and shall continue to honor commitment clearly recognize that defensive system have limitation and raise certain problem and ambiguity if pair with offensive system can be view as foster an aggressive policy and no one want that but with these consideration firmly in mind call upon the scientific community in country those who give nuclear weapon to turn great talent now to the cause of mankind and world peace to give the mean of render these nuclear weapon impotent and obsolete tonight consistent with obligation of the abm treaty and recognize the need for close consultation with ally be take an important first step be direct a comprehensive and intensive effort to define a long term research and development program to begin to achieve ultimate goal of eliminate the threat pose by strategic nuclear missile this could pave the way for arm control measure to eliminate the weapon seek neither military superiority nor political advantage only purpose all people share be to search for way to reduce the danger of nuclear war fellow americans tonight be launch an effort which hold the promise of change the course of human history there will be risk and result take time but believe can do as cross this threshold ask for prayer and support thank good night and god bless view transcript transcript reverend clergy all senator hawkins distinguished member of the florida congressional delegation and all of can not tell how have warm heart with welcome be delighted to be here today those of in the|national|association|of|evangelical be know for spiritual and humanitarian work and would be especially remiss if do not discharge right now personal debt of gratitude thank for prayer nancy and have feel presence many time in many way and believe for have make all the difference the other day in of the|white|house at a meeting there someone ask whether be aware of all the people out there who be pray for the president and have to say yes be have feel believe in intercessionary prayer but could not help but say to that questioner after would ask the question that or at least say to that if sometime when be pray get a busy signal be just in there ahead of laughter think understand how abraham|lincoln feel when say have be drive many time to knee by the overwhelming conviction that have nowhere else to go from the joy and the good feeling of this conference go to a political reception laughter now do not know why but that bit of scheduling remind of a story—[laughter]—which will share with an evangelical minister and a politician arrive at heaven 's gate one|day together and st.|peter after do all the necessary formality take in hand to show where quarter would be and take to a small single room with a bed a chair and a table and say this be for the clergyman and the politician be a little worried about what may be in store for and could not believe then when st.|peter stop in front of a beautiful mansion with lovely ground many servant and tell that these would be quarter and could not help but ask say but wait how — there be something wrong how do get this mansion while that good and holy man only get a single room and st.|peter say have to understand how thing be up here have get thousands|and|thousand of clergy be the first politician who ever make laughter but do not want to contribute to a stereotype laughter so tell there be a great many god fearing dedicated noble man and woman in public life present company include and yes need help to keep ever mindful of the idea and the principle that bring into the public arena in the first place the basis of those ideal and principle be a commitment to freedom and personal liberty that be ground in the much deep realization that freedom prosper only where the blessing of god be avidly seek and humbly accept the american experiment in democracy rest on this insight discovery be the great triumph of founding fathers voice by william|penn when say if will not be govern by god must be govern by tyrant explain the inalienable right of man jefferson say the god who give life give liberty at the same time and be george|washington who say that of all the disposition and habit which lead to political prosperity religion and morality be indispensable support and finally that shrewd of all observer of american democracy alexis|de|tocqueville put eloquently after have go on a search for the secret of america 's greatness and genius and say not until go into the church of america and hear pulpit aflame with righteousness do understand the greatness and the genius of america america be good and if america ever cease to be good america will cease to be great well be pleased to be here today with who be keep america great by keep good only through work and prayer and those of million of other can hope to survive this|perilous|century and keep alive this experiment in liberty this last good hope of man want to know that this administration be motivate by a political philosophy that see the greatness of america in people and in family church neighborhood community the institution that foster and nourish value like concern for other and respect for the rule of law under god now do not have to tell that this put in opposition to or at least out of step with a prevailing attitude of many who have turn to a modern day secularism discard the tried and time test value upon which very civilization be base no matter how well intentione value system be radically different from that of most americans and while proclaim that be free from superstition of the past have take upon the job of superintend by government rule and regulation sometimes voice be loud than our but be not yet a majority an example of that vocal superiority be evident in a controversy now go on in washington and since be involve have be wait to hear from the parent of young america how far be willing to go in give to government prerogative as parent let state the case as briefly and simply as can an organization of citizen sincerely motivated and deeply concerned about the increase in illegitimate birth and abortion involve girl well below the age of consent sometime ago establish a nationwide network of clinic to offer help to these girl and hopefully alleviate this situation now again let say do not fault intent however in well intentione effort these clinic have decide to provide advice and birth control drug and device to underage girl without the knowledge of parent for some|year now the federal government have help with fund to subsidize these clinic in provide for this the congress decree that every effort would be make to maximize parental participation nevertheless the drug and device be prescribe without get parental consent or give notification after have do so girl term sexually active"—and that have replace the word promiscuous"—are give this help in order to prevent illegitimate birth or abortion well have order clinic receive federal fund to notify the parent such help have be give of the nation 's lead newspaper have create the term squeal rule in editorialize against for do this and be be criticize for violate the privacy of young people a judge have recently grant an injunction against an enforcement of rule have watch tv panel show discuss this issue see columnist pontificate on error but no one seem to mention morality as play a part in the subject of sex be all of judeo christian tradition wrong be to believe that something so sacred can be look upon as a purely physical thing with no potential for emotional and psychological harm and be not the parent ' right to give counsel and advice to keep child from make mistake that may affect entire life many of in government would like to know what parent think about this intrusion in family by government be go to fight in the court the right of parent and the right of family take precedence over those of washington base bureaucrat and social engineer but the fight against parental notification be really only|one example of many attempt to water down traditional value and even abrogate the original term of american democracy freedom prosper when religion be vibrant and the rule of law under god be acknowledge when founding|father pass the first amendment seek to protect church from government interference never intend to construct a wall of hostility between government and the concept of religious belief the evidence of this permeate history and government the|declaration|of|independence mention the supreme be no less than time in god|we|trust be engrave on coinage the|supreme|court open proceeding with a religious invocation and the member of congress open session with a prayer just happen to believe the schoolchildren of the|united|state be entitle to the same privilege as justices and congressmen last|year send the congress a constitutional amendment to restore prayer to public school already this session there be grow bipartisan support for the amendment and be call on the congress to act speedily to pass and to let child pray perhaps some of read recently about the lubbock school case where a judge actually rule that be unconstitutional for a school district to give equal treatment to religious and nonreligious student group even when the group meeting be be hold during the student ' own time the first amendment never intend to require government to discriminate against religious speech senators denton and hatfield have propose legislation in the congress on the whole question of prohibit discrimination against religious form of student speech such legislation could go far to restore freedom of religious speech for public school student and hope the congress consider these bill quickly and with help think be possible could also get the constitutional amendment through the congress this|year more than a decade ago a decision literally wipe off the book of state statute protect the right of unborn child abortion on demand now take the life of up to unborn child a year human life legislation end this tragedy will some day pass the congress and and must never rest until do unless and until can be prove that the unborn child be not a live entity then right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness must be protect may remember that when abortion on demand begin many and indeed be sure many of warn that the practice would lead to a decline in respect for human life that the philosophical premise use to justify abortion on demand would ultimately be use to justify other attack on the sacredness of human life infanticide or mercy killing tragically enough those warning prove all too true only|last|year a court permit the death by starvation of a handicapped infant have direct the|health|and|human|services|department to make clear to every health care facility in the|united|state that the|rehabilitation|act of protect all handicapped person against discrimination base on handicap include infant and have take the further step of require that each and every recipient of federal fund who provide health care service to infant must post and keep post in a conspicuous place a notice state that discriminatory failure to feed and care for handicapped infant in this facility be prohibit by federal law also list a 24-hour toll free number so that nurse and other may report violation in time to save the infant 's life in addition recent legislation introduce in the congress by representative henry|hyde of illinois not only increase restriction on publicly finance abortion also address this whole problem of infanticide urge the congress to begin hearing and to adopt legislation that will protect the right of life to all child include the disabled or handicap now be sure that must get discourage at time but have do better than know perhaps there be a great spiritual awakening in america a renewal of the traditional value that have be the bedrock of america 's goodness and greatness recent survey by a washington base research council conclude that americans be far more religious than the people of other nation of those survey express a belief in god and a huge majority believe the ten commandments have real meaning in life and another study have find that an overwhelming majority of americans disapprove of adultery teenage sex pornography abortion and hard drug and this same study show a deep reverence for the importance of family tie and religious belief think the item that have discuss here today must be a key part of the nation 's political agenda for the first time the congress be openly and seriously debate and deal with the prayer and abortion issue and that be enormous progress right there repeat america be in the midst of a spiritual awakening and a moral renewal and with biblical keynote say today yes let justice roll on like a river righteousness like a never fail stream now obviously much of this new political and social consensus have talk about be base on a positive view of american history that take pride in country 's accomplishment and record but must never forget that no government scheme be go to perfect man know that live in this world mean deal with what philosopher would call the phenomenology of evil or as theologian would put the doctrine of sin there be sin and evil in the world and be enjoin by scripture and the lord jesus to oppose with all might nation too have a legacy of evil with which must deal the glory of this land have be capacity for transcend the moral evil of past for example the long struggle of minority citizen for equal right once a source of disunity and civil war be now a point of pride for all americans must never go back there be no room for racism anti - semitism or other form of ethnic and racial hatred in this country know that have be horrify as have by the resurgence of some hate group preach bigotry and prejudice use the mighty voice of pulpit and the powerful standing of church to denounce and isolate these hate group in midst the commandment give be clear and simple thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself but whatever sad episode exist in past any objective observer must hold a positive view of american history a history that have be the story of hope fulfil and dream make into reality especially in this|century america have keep alight the torch of freedom but not just for but for million of other around the world and this bring to final point today during first press conference as president in answer to a direct question point out that as good marxist leninists the soviet leader have openly and publicly declare that the only morality recognize be that which will further cause which be world revolution think should point out be only quote lenin guide spirit who say in that repudiate all morality that proceed from supernatural idea that be name for religion or idea that be outside class conception morality be entirely subordinate to the interest of class war and everything be moral that be necessary for the annihilation of the old exploit social order and for unite the proletariat well think the refusal of many influential people to accept this elementary fact of soviet doctrine illustrate an historical reluctance to see totalitarian power for what be see this phenomenon in the|1930s see too often today this do not mean should isolate and refuse to seek an understanding with intend to do everything can to persuade of peaceful intent to remind that be the west that refuse to use nuclear monopoly in the forty and fifty for territorial gain and which now propose 50-percent cut in strategic ballistic missile and the elimination of an entire class of land base intermediate range nuclear missile at the same time however must be make to understand will never compromise principle and standard will never give away freedom will never abandon belief in god and will never stop search for a genuine peace but can assure none of these thing america stand for through the so call nuclear freeze solution propose by some the truth be that a freeze now would be a very dangerous fraud for that be merely the illusion of peace the reality be that must find peace through strength would agree to a freeze if only could freeze the soviets ' global desire a freeze at current level of weapon would remove any incentive for the soviets to negotiate seriously in geneva and virtually end chance to achieve the major arm reduction which have propose instead would achieve objective through the freeze a freeze would reward the|soviet|union for enormous and unparalleled military buildup would prevent the essential and long overdue modernization of united|state and ally defense and would leave age force increasingly vulnerable and an honest freeze would require extensive prior negotiation on the system and number to be limit and on the measure to ensure effective verification and compliance and the kind of a freeze that have be suggest would be virtually impossible to verify such a major effort would divert completely from current negotiation on achieve substantial reduction a number of year ago hear a young father a very prominent young man in the entertainment world address a tremendous gathering in california be during the time of the cold war and communism and own way of life be very much on people 's mind and be speak to that subject and suddenly though hear say love little girl more than and say to oh no do not can't — don't say that but have underestimate go on would rather see little girl die now still believe in god than have grow up under communism and die no longer believe in god there be thousand of young people in that audience come to foot with shout of joy have instantly recognize the profound truth in what have say with regard to the physical and the soul and what be truly important yes let pray for the salvation of all of those who live in that totalitarian darkness pray will discover the joy of know god but until do let be aware that while preach the supremacy of the state declare omnipotence over individual man and predict eventual domination of all people on the earth be the focus of evil in the modern world be c.s.|lewis who in unforgettable screwtape|letter write the great evil be not do now in those sordid ' den of crime that dickens love to paint be not even do in concentration camp and labor camp in those see final result but be conceive and order move second carry and minute in clear carpet warm and well light office by quiet man with white collar and cut fingernail and smooth shaven cheek who do not need to raise voice well because these quiet man do not raise voice because sometimes speak in soothe tone of brotherhood and peace because like other dictator before be always make final territorial demand some would have accept at word and accommodate to aggressive impulse but if history teach anything teach that simple minded appeasement or wishful thinking about adversary be folly mean the betrayal of past the squandering of freedom so urge to speak out against those who would place the|united|state in a position of military and moral inferiority know have always believe that old screwtape reserve good effort for those of in the church so in discussion of the nuclear freeze proposal urge to beware the temptation of pride the temptation of blithely declare yourself above all and label both side equally at fault to ignore the fact of history and the aggressive impulse of an evil empire to simply call the arm race a giant misunderstanding and thereby remove from the struggle between right and wrong and good and evil ask to resist the attempt of those who would have withhold support for effort this administration 's effort to keep america strong and free while negotiate real and verifiable reduction in the world 's nuclear arsenal and with god 's help total elimination while america 's military strength be important let add here that have always maintain that the struggle now go on for the world will never be decide by bomb or rocket by army or military might the real crisis face today be a spiritual one at root be a test of moral will and faith whittaker chambers the man whose own religious conversion make a witness to of the terrible trauma of time the hiss chambers case write that the crisis of the western world exist to the degree in which the west be indifferent to god the degree to which collaborate in communism 's attempt to make man stand alone without god and then say for marxism leninism be actually the second old faith first proclaim in with the word of temptation ye shall be as god the western world can answer this challenge write but only provide that faith in god and the freedom enjoin be as great as communism 's faith in man believe shall rise to the challenge believe that communism be another sad bizarre chapter in human history whose last page even now be be write believe this because the source of strength in the quest for human freedom be not material but spiritual and because know no limitation must terrify and ultimately triumph over those who would enslave fellow man for in the word of isaiah giveth power to the faint and to that have no might increase strength but that wait upon the lord shall renew strength shall mount up with wing as eagle shall run and not be weary yes change world of founding|father say have within power to begin the world over again can do do together what no church could do by god bless and thank very much view transcript transcript lady and gentleman mr. chairman reverend clergy mickey thank very much for those very kind word and thank all of for certainly a most hearty and warm welcome be grateful to the|american|conservative|union young americans for freedom national|review and human|event for organize this third annual memorial service for the democratic platform of someone ask why want to make in a row well know how the irish love wakes.&nbsp but be delighted to be back here with at 10th annual conference in last address have talk about common perception and goal and think may report to here tonight on where stand in achieve those goal a sort of state of the reagan report if will now be the first to acknowledge that there be a good deal leave unfinished on the conservative agenda cleanup crew will need more|than|2|years to deal with the mess leave by other for over|half|a|century but be not dishearten in fact attitude about that unfinished agenda be not very different from that express in an anecdote about of favorite president calvin|coolidge.&nbsp some of may know that after cal|coolidge be introduce to the sport of fishing by secret|service detail get to be quite a passion with if can use that word about silent|cal anyway be once ask by reporter how many fish be in of favorite angling place and coolidge say the water be estimate to carry trout and then say have not catch all yet but sure have intimidate well be true have not bring about every change important to the conscience of a conservative but conservative can take a great deal of honest pride in what have achieve in a|few|minute want to talk about just how far have come and what need to do to win further victory but right now think a word or on strategy be in order may remember that in the past mention that be not task as conservative to just point out the mistake make over all|the|decade of liberal government not just to form an able opposition but to govern to lead a nation and note this would make new demand upon movement upon all of for the first time in half|a|century have develop a whole new cadre of young conservative in government have show that conservative can do more than criticize have show that can govern and move legislation through the congress now know there be concern over attempt to roll back some of the gain that have make and seem to that here ought to give some thought to strategy to make sure that stop and think before act for example some of critic have be say recently that want to take back the people 's third year tax cut and abolish tax indexing and some other include member of staff want immediately to open up a verbal barrage against well hope know that sometimes be well if a president do not say exactly what be on mind there be an old story about a farmer and a lawyer that illustrate point seem that these get into a pretty bad collision a traffic accident both get out of car the farmer take look at the lawyer walk back to car get a package bring back there be a bottle inside and say here look pretty shake up think ought to take a nip of this will steady nerve well the lawyer do and the farmer say still look a little bit pale how about another and the lawyer take another swallow and under the urging of the farmer take another and another and another and then finally say be feel pretty good and ask the farmer if do not think that ought to have a little nip too and the farmer say not be wait for the state wonder if can not learn something from that farmer if liberal friend really want to head into the next election under the banner of take away from the american people first real tax cut in nearly|20|years if after peer into heart of heart feel must tell the american people that over the|next|6|year want to reduce the income of an average family by and if want to voice these deeply hold conviction in well fellow conservative who be to stifle the voice of conscience?&nbsp now in talk about legislative agenda know that some of have be disturb by the notion of standby tax increase in the so call out year well be not wild about the idea but the economy be get well and believe these improvement be only the beginning and with some luck and if the american people respond with the kind of energy and initiative have always show in the past well maybe be time start think about some standby tax cut too but know the great thing about that standby tax increase be that if be pass can not put into effect unless have first agree to all spending cut do give something to think about but know with regard to the economy wonder if political adversary have not once again prove that be good ally spend the|last|16|month or so place all the responsibility for the state of the economy on shoulder and with some help from the medium be be a pretty impressive campaign have create quite an image we're responsible for the economy well assume that be responsible then for inflation which after back to back year in double digit before get here have now be reduce to in and for the|last|3|months|of|that|year run at only|1.1|percent in real wage increase for the first time in 3|year interest rate as have already be tell have drop dramatically with the prime rate shrink by nearly|50|percent and in december the index of lead indicator be a full 6.3|percent above last|march 's low point and have rise in of the|last|9|months last|month housing start be up and building permit over last|year at this time new home sale be up by since april and inventory of unsold home be at the low level in more|than|a|decade auto production this|quarter be schedule to increase by and general|motor alone be put of worker back on the job last|month 's sharp decline in the unemployment rate be the most heartening sign of all would have take a job bill to reduce unemployment by the same amount and do not cost anything be time to admit guilt time admit that liberal critic have be right all the time and should go right on tell the american people that the state of the economy be precisely the fault of that wicked creature kemp roth and havoc break truth reaganomics let confess let admit that have turn the corner on the economy and be especially proud of thing when hit heavy weather do not panic do not go for fast bromide and quick fix the huge tax increase or wage and price control recommend by so many and stubbornness if want to call that will quite literally pay off for every american in the|years|ahead so let pledge to tonight carefully have set out on the road to recovery will not be deter will not be turn back reject the policy of the past the policy of tax and tax spend and spend elect and elect the lesson of these fail policy be clear have say this before can not drink sober or spend rich and can not prime the pump without pump the prime as somebody do like to in and a word be in order here on the most historic of all the legislative reform have achieve in the|last|2|years — that of tax indexing can understand the terror that strike in the heart of those whose principal constituency be big government bracket creep be government 's hide incentive to inflate the currency and bring on inflation and indexing will end that will end those huge hidden subsidy for big and big government in the future if get indexing plant firmly as a law of the land the advocate of big government who want money more money for social spending social engineering scheme will have to go to the people and say right out loud want more money from weekly paycheck so be raise taxis do that instead of sneak out by way of inflation which have help bring on so all the professional washingtonians from bureaucrat to lobbyist to the special interest group be frightened plain scared and be work overtime to take this back well think speak for all conservative when say tax indexing be nonnegotiable be a fight will take to the people and will win but think can see how even this debate show thing be change for the well highlight the essential difference between philosophy now contend for power in american political life be the philosophy of the past a philosophy that have as constituent an ill assorted mix of elitist and special interest group who see government as the principal vehicle of social change who believe that the only thing have to fear be the people who must be watch and regulate and superintend from washington on the other hand political philosophy be at the heart of the new political consensus that emerge in america at the|beginning|of|this|decade that believe all — well believe will dominate american politic for many|decade the economic disaster bring about by too much government be the catalyst for this consensus during the|seventie the american people begin to see misdirect overgrown government as the source of many of social problem not the solution this new consensus have a view of government that be essentially that of founding father that government be the servant not the master that be mean to maintain order to protect nation 's safety but otherwise in the word of that note political philosopher schnozzle jimmy|durante do not put no constriction on da people leave da heck the overriding goal during the|past|2|years have be to give the government back to the american people to make responsive again to wish and desire to do more than bring about a healthy economy or a grow gross national product have truly bring about a quiet revolution in american|government for too many|years bureaucratic self interest and political maneuvering hold sway over efficiency and honesty in government federal dollar be treat as the property of bureaucrat not taxpayer those in the|federal|establishment who point to the misuse of those dollar be look upon as malcontent or troublemaker well this administration have break with what be a kind of a buddy system there have be dramatic turnabout in some of the more scandal ridden and wasteful federal agency and program only|a|few|years|ago the|general|services|administration be rack by indictment and report after report of inefficiency and waste today at gsa jerry|carmen have not only put the whistle blower back in charge be promote and give new responsibility just listen to this little set of figure today general|services|administration work in progress time be down from to even while the agency have sustain budget cut of office space reduction of and the attrition of employee at the|government|printing|office under dan|sawyer loss of millions|of|dollar have suddenly be end as the workforce be cut through attrition and a hire freeze and overtime pay be cut by in alone the government publication program which run a cumulative loss of over a period register a profit and the gpo as a whole have experience a profit of last|year be say by some that this administration have turn a blind eye to waste and fraud at the pentagon while overzealously concentrate on the social program well at the pentagon under cap|weinberger 's leadership and superb service secretaries jack|marsh john|lehman and verne|orr have identify in saving on waste and fraud and over the|next|7|years multiyear procurement and other acquisition initiative will save almost|$30|billion now these be only|three example of what be attempt to do to make government more efficient the list go on have wield inspector general as a strike force account for nearly|$17|billion in saving in with peter|grace 's help have call on top management executive and expert from the private sector to suggest modern management technique for every aspect of government operation and with an exciting new project call reform|88 be go to streamline and reorganize the process that control the money information personnel and property of the federal bureaucracy the maze through which nearly|$2|trillion pass each|year and which include different payroll system and personnel office there be more much more — from cut down wasteful travel practice to reduce paperwork from aggressively pursue the in bad debt owe the|federal|government to reduce publication of copy of wasteful or unnecessary government publication but know make government responsive again to the people involve more than eliminate waste and fraud and inefficiency during the|decade when government be intrude into area where be neither competent nor need be also ignore legitimate and constitutional duty such as preserve the domestic peace and provide for the common defense will talk about defense in a moment know have already hear about that today some of but on the matter of domestic order a few thing need to be say first of all be abundantly clear that much of crime problem be provoke by a social philosophy that see man as primarily a creature of material environment the same liberal philosophy that see an era of prosperity and virtue usher in by change man 's environment through massive federal spending program also view criminal as the unfortunate product of poor socioeconomic condition or an underprivileged upbringing society not the individual say be at fault for criminal wrongdoing be to blame well today a new political consensus utterly reject this point of view the american people demand that government exercise legitimate and constitutional duty to punish career criminal those who consciously choose to make life by prey on the innocent now conservative have be warn about the crime problem for many|years about that permissive social philosophy that do so much to foster about a legal system that seem to specialize in let hardened criminal go free and now have the mean and the power to do something let get to work drugpusher after drugpusher mobster after mobster have escape justice by take advantage of flawed bail and parole system criminal who have commit atrocious act have cynically utilize the technicality of the exclusionary rule a miscarriage of justice unique to legal system indeed study show that of those arrest for drug felony in los|angeles|county in be back out on the street because of perceive problem with the exclusionary rule now the exclusionary rule — that be not a law that be pass by congress or a state legislature be what be call case law the result of judicial decision if a law enforcement officer obtain evidence as the result of a violation of the law regard search and seizure that evidence can not be introduce in a trial even if prove the guilt of the accuse now this be hardly punishment of the officer for violation of legal procedure and be only effect in many case be to free someone patently guilty of a crime do not know maybe have tell this before but have to give a glare example of what have take too much time to explain here california narcotic agent base on the evidence that have obtain a legal warrant to search a home of a man and woman suspect of peddle heroin search the home do not find anything but as be leave just on a hunch turn back to the baby in the crib and take down the diaper and there be the stash of heroin the evidence be throw out of court and the couple go free because the baby have not give permission for the violation of constitutional right well this administration have propose vital reform of bail and parole system and criminal forfeiture and sentencing statute these reform be pass by the senate anticrime package never get out of committee in the|house|of|representatives do see a target there the american people want these reform and want now be ask tonight that mobilize all the powerful resource of this political movement to get these measure pass by the congress on another front all of know how vitally important be for to reverse the decline in american education to take responsibility for the education of child out of the hand of the bureaucrat and put back in the hand of parent and teacher that be why the congress must stop dither need those tuition tax credit need a voucher system for the parent of disadvantaged child need education saving account a sort of ira for college and finally and do not think for a moment have give up — need to eliminate that unnecessary and politically engender department|of|education there be other step be take to restore government to rightful duty to restore the political consensus upon which this nation be found founding father prohibit a federal establishment of religion but there be no evidence that intend to set up a wall of separation between the state and religious belief the evidence of this be all around in the declaration of independence alone there be no few than mention of a supreme being in god trust be engrave on coinage the|supreme|court open proceeding with a religious invocation and the congress open each|day with prayer from chaplain the schoolchildren of the|united|state be entitle to the same privilege as justices and congressmen join in persuade the congress to accede to the overwhelming desire of the american people for a constitutional amendment permit prayer in school and finally on domestic agenda there be a subject that weigh heavily on all of the tragedy of abortion on demand this be a grave moral evil and one that require the full discussion on the floor of the house and senate as see in the|last|century with the issue of slavery any attempt by the congress to stifle or compromise away discussion of important moral issue only further inflame emotion on both side and lead ultimately to even more social disruption and disunity so tonight would ask that the congress discuss the issue of abortion openly and freely on the floor of the house and senate let those who believe the practice of abortion to be a moral evil join in take this case to fellow americans and let do so rationally calmly and with an honest regard for fellow americans speak for believe that once the implication of abortion on demand be fully air and understand by the american people will resolutely seek abolition now know there be many who sincerely believe that limit the right of abortion violate the freedom of choice of the individual but if the unborn child be a live entity then there be individual each with the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness unless and until someone can prove the unborn be not alive and all medical evidence indicate be then must concede the benefit of the doubt to the unborn infant but whether be cut spending and taxing shrink the size of the deficit end overregulation inefficiency fraud and waste in government crack down on career criminal revitalize american education press for prayer and abortion legislation think can see that the agenda have put before america these|past|2|years have be a conservative one oh and there be other matter that think would be interested in first as part of federalism effort next|week will be send to the congress proposal for four|megablock grant that will return vital prerogative to the states where belong and second the|office|of|management|and|budget will press ahead with new regulation prohibit the use of federal tax dollar for purpose of political advocacy and these important domestic initiative have be complement by the conservative idea have bring to the pursuit of foreign policy in the struggle now go on for the world have not be afraid to characterize adversary for what be have focus world attention on force labor on the soviet pipeline and soviet repression in poland and all the other nation that make up what be call the fourth world"—those live under totalitarian rule who long for freedom publicize the evidence of chemical warfare and other atrocity in cambodia which be now suppose to call kampuchea and in afghanistan point out that totalitarian power hold a radically different view of morality and human dignity than do must develop a forward strategy for freedom base on hope that someday representative government will be enjoy by all the people and all the nation of the earth have be strive to give the world the fact about the international arm race ever since nearly total demobilization after world|war|ii in the west have be play catchup yes there be be an international arm race as some of the declare democratic candidate for the presidency tell but let also tell there be only be side do the racing those of in the frontline of the conservative movement can be of special assistance in further strategy for freedom fight against totalitarianism first of all there be no more important foreign policy initiative in this administration and none that frighten adversary more than attempt through international radio to build constituency for peace in nation dominate by totalitarian militaristic regime have propose to the congress modest but vitally important expenditure for the|voice|of|america radio|free|europe and radio|marti these proposal stall last|year but with help can get through the congress this|year and believe nothing could mean more to the poles lithuanians cubans and all the million of other live in that fourth world now would be also unconscionable during any discussion of the need for candor in foreign policy not to mention here the tragic event that last|year shock the world the attack on holiness pope john|paul|ii — an act of unspeakable evil an assault on man and god be an international outrage and merit the full possible investigation tonight want to take this opportunity to applaud the courage and resourcefulness of the|government|of|italy in bring this matter to the attention of the world and contrary to what some have suggest can depend on there be no one on side that be act embarrassed or feeling embarrassed because be go ahead with that investigation mean to help and now cap can breathe easy because here come must continue to revitalize and strengthen armed|force cap|weinberger be be wag an heroic 's battle on this front be ask the conservative leader here tonight to make support for defense buildup of top priority but besides progress in further all of these item on the conservative agenda something else be occur something that someday conservative may be very proud happen under leadership even with all recent economic hardship believe a feeling of optimism be now enter the american consciousness a belief that the|days of division and discord be behind and that an era of unity and national renewal be upon a vivid reminder of how nation have learn and grow and transcend the tragedy of the past be give to here in washington only|a|few|months|ago last|november on the mall between the|lincoln|memorial and the|washington|monument a new memorial be dedicated of dark low lie wall inscribe with the name of those who give life in the vietnam conflict soon there will be add a sculpture of infantryman

herbie|petit a machinist and former marine from new|orleans last|night say stand near the wall go out to dinner with some ex - marine there be also a group of college student in the restaurant start talk to each other and before leave stand up and cheer the whole week petit say eye red be worth just for that have be worth americans have learn again to listen to each other to trust each other have learn that government owe the people an explanation and need support for action at home and abroad and have learn and pray this time for good that must never again send young man to fight and die in conflict that leader be not prepared to win thank very much yet the most valuable lesson of all the preciousness of human freedom have be relearn not just by americans but all the people of the world

when explain why flee vietnam for freedom no previous regime in country write about the concentration camp and boat people of vietnam bring such number of people to such desperation not the military dictator not the colonialist not even the ancient chinese warlord be a lesson that compatriot and learn through witness and through suffering in own life the fate of countryman be a lesson that must eventually move the conscience of the world this man who have fight on the other side learn the value of freedom only after help to destroy and see those who have have to give up the task that have fall to as americans be to move the conscience of the world to keep alive the hope and dream of freedom for if fail or falter there will be no place for the world 's oppress to flee to this be not a role seek preach no manifest destiny but like the americans who bring a new nation into the world history have ask much of in time much have already give much more must be prepared to give this be not a task shrink from be a task welcome for with the privilege of live in this kindly pleasant green land call america this land of generous spirit and great ideal there be also a destiny and a duty a

challenge of government be to identify the thing that can do now to ease the massive economic transition for the american people the federal budget be both a symptom and a cause of economic problem unless reduce the dangerous growth rate in government spending could face the prospect of sluggish economic growth into the indefinite future failure to cope with this problem now could mean as much as more in national debt in the|next|four|years|alone that would average in additional debt for every man woman child and baby in nation to assure a sustained recovery must continue get runaway spending under control to bring those deficit down if do not the recovery will be too short unemployment will remain too high and will leave an unconscionable burden of national debt for child that must not do let be clear about where the deficit problem come from contrary to the drumbeat have be hear for the|last|few|month the deficit face be not root in defense spending take as a percentage of the gross national product defense spending happen to be only|about|four fifth of what be in nor be the deficit as some would have root in tax cut even with tax cut taxis as a fraction of gross national product remain about the same as be in the fact be deficit come from the uncontrolled growth of the budget for domestic spending during the 's the share of national income devote to this domestic spending increase by more|than|60|percent from out of every dollar produce by the american people to in spite of all economy and efficiency and without add any new program basic necessary domestic spending provide for in this year 's budget will grow to almost|a|trillion|dollar over the|next|5|year the deficit problem be a clear and present danger to the basic health of republic need a plan to overcome this danger a plan base on these principle must be bipartisan conquer the deficit and put the government 's house in order will require the good effort of all of must be fair just as all will share in the benefit that will come from recovery all would share fairly in the burden of transition must be prudent the strength of national defense must be restore so that can pursue prosperity and peace and freedom while maintain commitment to the truly needy and finally must be realistic can not rely on hope alone with these guide principle in mind let outline a part plan to increase economic growth and reduce deficit first in budget message will recommend a federal spending freeze know this be strong medicine but so far have only cut the rate of increase in federal spending the government have continue to spend more money each year though not as much more as do in the past take as a whole the budget be propose for the|fiscal|year will increase no more than the rate of inflation in other word the|federal|government will hold the line on real spending now that be far less than many american family have have to do in these difficult time will request that the propose freeze in cost of living adjustment recommend by the bipartisan social|security|commission be apply to other government relate retirement program will also propose a freeze on a broad range of domestic spending program and for federal civilian and military pay and pension program and let say right here be sorry with regard to the military in ask that of because for so|many|year have be so far behind and so low in reward for what the man and woman in uniform be do but be sure will understand that this must be across the board and fair will ask the congress to adopt specific measure to control the growth of the so call uncontrollable spending program these be the automatic spending program such as food stamp that can not be simply freeze and that have grow by over|400|percent since be the large single cause of the build in or structural deficit problem standard here will be fairness ensure that the taxpayer ' hard earn dollar go only to the truly needy that none of be turn away but that fraud and waste be stamp out and be sorry to say there be a lot of out there in the food stamp program alone last|year identify almost in overpayment the taxpayer be not the only victim of this kind of abuse the truly needy suffer as fund intend for be take not by the needy but by the greedy for everyone 's sake must put an end to such waste and corruption third will adjust program to restore america 's defense by propose in defense saving over the|next|5|year these be saving recommend to by the secretary of defense who have assure can be safely achieve and will not diminish ability to negotiate arm reduction or endanger america 's security will not gamble with national survival and fourth because must ensure reduction and eventual elimination of deficit over will propose a standby tax limit to of the gross national product to start in fiscal|1986 would last no|more|than|3|year and would start only if the congress have first approve spending freeze and budget control program and there be several other condition also that must be meet all of in order for this program to be trigger now could say that this be an insurance policy for the future a remedy that will be at hand if need but only resort to if absolutely necessary in the meantime will continue to study way to simplify the tax code and make more fair for all americans this be a goal that every american who be ever struggle with a tax form can understand at the same time however will oppose any effort to undo the basic tax reform that have already enact include the 10-percent tax break come to taxpayer and the tax indexing which will protect all americans from inflationary bracket creep in the|years|ahead now realize that this part plan be easy to describe than will be to enact but the loom deficit that hang over and over america 's future must be reduce the path have outline be fair balanced and realistic if enact will ensure a steady decline in deficit aim toward a balanced budget by the|end|of|the|decade be the only path that will lead to a strong sustained recovery let follow that path together no domestic challenge be more crucial than provide stable permanent job for all

the|lebanon|war tragic as be have leave with a new opportunity for middle|east peace must seize now and bring peace to this troubled area so vital to world stability while there be still time be with this strong conviction that over a|month|ago before the present negotiation in beirut have be complete direct secretary of state|shultz to again review policy and to consult a wide range of outstanding americans on the good way to strengthen chance for peace in the|middle|east have consult with many of the official who be historically involve in the process with member of the congress

the|middle|east do not begin and end in lebanon as help lebanon rebuild must also move to resolve the root cause of conflict between arabs and israelis the war in lebanon have demonstrate many thing but consequence be key to the peace process first the military loss of the plo have not diminish the yearning of the palestinian people for a just solution of claim and second while israel 's military success in lebanon have demonstrate that armed force be second to none in the region alone can not bring just and last peace to israel and neighbor the question now be how to reconcile israel 's legitimate security concern with the legitimate right of the palestinians and that answer can only come at the negotiating table each party must recognize that the outcome must be acceptable to all and that true peace will require compromise by all so tonight be call for a fresh start this be the moment for all those directly concerned to get involved or lend support to a workable basis for peace the camp david agreement remain the foundation of policy language provide all party with the leeway need for successful negotiation call on israel to make clear that the security for which yearn can only be achieve through genuine peace a peace require magnanimity vision and courage call on the palestinian people to recognize that own political aspiration be inextricably bind to recognition of israel 's right to a secure future and call on the|arab|state to accept the reality of israel — and the reality that peace and justice be to be gain only through hard fair direct negotiation in make these call upon other recognize that the|united|states have a special responsibility no other nation be in a position to deal with the key party to the conflict on the basis of trust and reliability the time have come for a new realism on the part of all the people of the|middle|east the|state|of|israel be an accomplished fact deserve unchallenged legitimacy within the community of nation but israel 's legitimacy have thus far be recognize by too few country and have be deny by every arab state except egypt israel exist have a right to exist in peace behind secure and defensible border and have a right to demand of neighbor that recognize those fact have personally follow and support israel 's heroic struggle for survival ever since the founding of the state of israel in the pre-1967 border israel be barely|10|mile wide at narrow point the bulk of israel 's population live within artillery range of hostile arab army be not about to ask israel to live that way again the war in lebanon have demonstrate another reality in the region the departure of the palestinians from beirut dramatize more than ever the homelessness of the palestinian people palestinians feel strongly that cause be more than a question of refugee agree the camp david agreement recognize that fact when speak of the legitimate right of the palestinian people and just requirement for peace to endure must involve all those who have be most deeply affected by the conflict only through broad participation in the peace process most immediately by jordan and by the palestinians will israel be able to rest confident in the knowledge that security and integrity will be respect by neighbor only through the process of negotiation can all the nation of the|middle|east achieve a secure peace these then be general goal what be the specific new american position and why be take in the camp david talk thus far both israel and egypt have feel free to express openly view as to what the outcome should be understandably view have differ on many point the|united|state have thus far seek to play the role of mediator have avoid public comment on the key issue have always recognize and continue to recognize that only the voluntary agreement of those party most directly involve in the conflict can provide an endure solution but be become evident to that some clear sense of america 's position on the key issue be necessary to encourage wide support for the peace process first as outline in the camp david accord there must be a period of time during which the palestinian inhabitant of and gaza will have full autonomy over own affair due consideration must be give to the principle of self government by the inhabitant of the territory and to the legitimate security concern of the party involve the purpose of the period of transition which would begin after free election for a self govern palestinian authority be to prove to the palestinians that can run own affair and that such palestinian autonomy pose no threat to israel 's security the|united|state will not support the use of any additional land for the purpose of settlement during the transitional period indeed the immediate adoption of a settlement freeze by israel more than any other action could create the confidence need for wide participation in these talk further settlement activity be in no way necessary for the security of israel and only diminish the confidence of the arabs that a final outcome can be freely and fairly negotiate want to make the american position well understand the purpose of this transitional period be the peaceful and orderly transfer of authority from israel to the palestinian inhabitant of and gaza at the same time such a transfer must not interfere with israel 's security requirement beyond the transition period as look to the future of and gaza be clear to that peace can not be achieve by the formation of an independent palestinian state in those territory nor be achievable on the basis of israeli sovereignty or permanent control over the|west|bank and gaza so the|united|states will not support the establishment of an independent palestinian state in the|west|bank and gaza and will not support annexation or permanent control by israel there be however another way to peace the final status of these land must of course be reach through the give and take of negotiation but be the firm view of the|united|state that self government by the palestinians of and gaza in association with jordan offer the good chance for a durable just and last peace base approach squarely on the principle that the arab israeli conflict should be resolve through negotiation involve an exchange of territory for peace this exchange be enshrine in

middle|east peace effort be position that in return for peace the withdrawal provision of resolution|242 apply to all front include the west|bank and gaza when the border be negotiate between jordan and israel view on the extent to which israel should be ask to give up territory will be heavily affect by the extent of true peace and normalization and the security arrangement offer in return finally remain convinced that jerusalem must remain undivided but final status should be decide through negotiation in the course of the negotiation to come the|united|states will support position that seem to fair and reasonable compromise and likely to promote a sound agreement will also put forward own detailed proposal when believe can be helpful and make no mistake the|united|states will oppose any proposal from any party and at any point in the negotiating process that threaten the security of israel america 's commitment to the security of israel be ironclad and may add so be mine during the|past|few|day ambassador in israel egypt jordan and saudi|arabia have present to host government the proposal in full detail that have outline here today now be convinced that these proposal can bring justice bring security and bring durability to an arab israeli peace the|united|state will stand by these principle with total dedication be fully consistent with israel 's security requirement and the aspiration of the palestinians will work hard to broaden participation at the peace table as envisage by the camp david accord and fervently hope that the palestinians and jordan with the support of arab colleague will accept this opportunity tragic turmoil in the|middle|east run back to the dawn of history in modern day conflict after conflict have take brutal toll there in

peaceful future ask fellow americans for support and prayer in this great undertaking thank and god bless & nbsp & nbsp view transcript transcript fellow americans there be an old saying have all hear a|thousand time about the weather and how everyone talk about but no one do anything about well many of must be feel that way about the present state of economy certainly there be a lot of talk about but want to know be do something about and the reason want to talk to be because can help do something about believe if some of be confused can understand why for some time ever since start plan the budget for the|fiscal|year begin this|coming|october|1st there be be a steady drumbeat of report on what be suppose to be do know have read and hear on the news a variety of statement attribute to various authoritative government source who prefer not to have name use well know name and think be an authoritative source on this since be right in the middle of what be go on here so would like to set the record straight on a few of the thing that may have hear lately be sure have hear that be propose the large single tax increase in history the truth be be propose nothing of the kind and then there be the one that economic recovery program have fail so have abandon and turn to increase taxis instead of try to reduce federal spending well do not believe that one either yes there be a tax bill before the congress tie to a program of further cut in spending be not however the great single tax increase in history possibly could be call the great tax reform in history but absolutely do not represent any reversal of policy or philosophy on the part of this administration or this president now may have hear that some special interest oppose this bill and that be right some do as a matter of fact some in the congress of own party object to this bill and strongly be tell by many that this bill be not politically popular and may not be why then do support support because be right for america support because be fair support because will when combine with cut in government spending reduce interest rate and put more americans back to work again now will recall that when administration come into office a|year|ago|last|january announce a plan for economic recovery recovery from what from a recession that see inflation in double digit figure for the|second|year|in|a|row be when arrive interest rate have go into outer space be at the high would be in a|hundred|years with a prime rate that hit percent there be americans out of work and in several hard hit industrial states there already be pocket of unemployment reach figure of and even go to those area know the cost of government be increase at a rate of a year there be little could do about the budget already in place but could do something about the one that have be propose for the|fiscal|year begin in october of our|first|year would campaign on the belief that government cost should be reduce and that the percentage of the people 's earning take by government in taxis should also be reduce also say that area of government spending could not be reduce but must instead be increase that be the spending necessary to restore nation 's defense which have be allow to deteriorate to a dangerous degree in the precede 4|year interest rate continue high as the|month go by and unemployment increase particularly in the automobile industry and housing construction few could or would afford the high interest rate for home mortgage or installment buying of an automobile meantime be put economic recovery program in place be not easy do not get all the cut want and get some tax measure do not want but be chart a complete turnaround in government policy and do get the major part of what propose the congress mandate spending cut of over 3|year and adopt the big tax cut in history now this too be to be implement over a period begin with a cut in the personal income tax beginning october|1st,|1981 then a 10-percent cut this|last|july and another schedule for july|1st,|1983 these will be follow by indexing of the tax bracket so worker get cost of live pay raise will not be move up into high bracket have to realize inflation be a tax government profit by inflation but indexing will put a stop to that there be tax cut for business and industry to help provide capital for modernization of plant and equipment change in the estate tax capital gain tax and the marriage penalty tax some who support on the spending cut be fearful about cut taxis in view of the continue budget deficit feel that tax cut have to be a part of plan in order to provide incentive for individual and for business to increase productivity and thus create job for the unemployed now be only be ten|month since the first phase of program go into effect as say earlier there be those who say be be try and fail well as use to say let look at the record start with interest rate the basic cause of the present recession the prime rate be as say well last|week be and as of today major bank have lower to last|week treasury bill be pay less|than|9|percent interest one|year|ago be pay that double digit inflation have be cut in half for the|last|6|months real earning be at last increase for the first time in quite a long time personal saving which trend downward throughout the|last|decade be increase this mean more money in the pool of investment capital this will help further reduce interest rate all of this in only|10|month hardly look like a program that fail to oh yes fail to mention that in the|quarter just end there be an increase in economic growth the first such increase in a long time big problem the last one to be solve in every recession be unemployment understand how tough be for those who be wait for the job that come with recovery can have no rest until neighbor fellow citizen who want to work be able once again to find job again let say the main obstacle to doing so be continue high interest rate those rate should be low now than be with the success have have in reduce inflation but part of the problem be psychological a pessimism in the money market that will not stay the course and continue lower the cost of government the project increase in budget deficit have add to that pessimism and fear and this bring back to that so call great tax increase in history and the budget proposal now before the congress when submit the budget to the congress in february contain very significant spending cut on top of those obtain last|year this time however could not get the support have last|year some who have not be happy about the tax cut then be now insist must have additional tax revenue in fact want to cancel the reduction schedule for next|july and cancel the indexing of tax bracket other propose tax increase mount to about|$150|billion over a period on top of this there be resistance to the spending reduction ask for and even attempt to eliminate some of last|year 's cut so as to actually increase spending for many|month now have be work to get a compromise budget that would further reduce spending and thus reduce the deficit also have stand firm on retain the tax cut already in place because as say be essential to restore the economy do however agree to limited revenue increase so long as do not harm the incentive feature of economic recovery program last|year have call attention to the possibility of well compliance with the tax law collect taxis legitimately owe but which be not be pay well week and week of negotiation result in a congressional budget resolution combine revenue increase and further spending reduction revenue would increase over a period by about|$99|billion and outlay in that same period would be reduce by now as can see that figure out to about a less in spending outlay for each of increase revenue this compromise add up to a total over three|year of a reduction in the budget deficit and remember original tax reduction remain in place which mean taxis will still be cut in these|next|three|year even with the passage of this present tax bill now let take that tax program apart and decide whether be the big tax increase in history of the|entire|$99|billion be collection of tax presently owe under the present law and which be not be pay now to all of who be pay tax simple fairness say should collect from those who be freeload roughly|48|billion of the 99|billion represent close off special interest loophole which have result in unintended tax advantage for some not all — taxpayer some who be financially well able to pay share now this be also a matter of simple fairness so more|than|80|percent of the tax bill be not new tax at all but be well collect and correct of flaw in the system now this leave over three|year of actual new taxis which be far outweigh by the tax cut which will benefit individual there be an excise tax on cigarette another on telephone well for people who smoke a pack a day that tax will mean an increase of only|$2.40 a month the telephone tax increase be a month for the average household right now the tax reduction that pass last|year be save the average family about|$400 per year next|year even after this new tax bill be pass the saving will almost double will go|to|$788 and here be what the total look like the new tax reform will raise in 3|year about as say in the|same|3|years as say a moment ago tax cut program even after this increase will save within the new bill there have of course be disagreement over some of the specific provision for example there be considerable confusion over the proposal to have withholding of tax due on interest and dividend just as be withhold now on wage and salary many senior citizen have be lead to believe this be a new tax add on top of the present income tax well there be no truth whatsoever to that find that while the overwhelming majority of americans faithfully report income from interest and dividend and pay taxis on some do not be of the significant area of noncompliance and be cost the government about|$9|billion a year in the case of those over age|65 withholding will only apply to those with income of and up per individual and for couple file a joint return low income citizen below|65 will be exempt if income be for an individual or for those file joint return and there will be an exemption for all interest payment of or less the only people whose taxis will be increase by this withholding be those who presently be evade fair share of the tax burden once again be strive to see that all taxpayer be treat fairly now this withholding will go into effect not this|january|1st as be earlier report back during the campaign— n september|9th,|1980 to be exact say goal be to reduce by the share of the gross national product take by the government in taxis reduce to if have do nothing would have rise to almost|25|percent but even after passage of this bill in will only be take of the gross national product make no mistake about this whole package be a compromise have to swallow hard to agree to any revenue increase but there be side to a compromise those who support the increase revenue swallow hard to accept in outlay cut other have accept specific provision with regard to taxis or spending cut which oppose there be a provision in the bill for extended unemployment payment in states particularly hard hit by unemployment if this provision be not enact unemployed people will use up benefit by the|end|of|march repeat much of this bill will make tax system more fair for every american especially those in low income bracket be still dedicated to reduce the level of spending until be within income and still want to see the base of the economy broaden so that the individual 's tax burden can be further reduce over the|year growth in government and deficit spending have be build into system now would be nice if could just cut that out of system with a single sharp slice that however can not be do without bring great hardship down on many of less fortunate neighbor who be not in a position to provide for and none of want that effort to restore fiscal integrity and common sense to the federal establishment be not limit to the budget cut and tax policy vice president bush head up a task force that be be review excessive regulation already enough unnecessary and duplicative regulation have be eliminate or revise to save an|estimated|$6|billion every|year inspectors general have be mobilize into a task force aim at

hundred of community and statewide project perform service voluntarily that once be think to be the province of government some of the most innovative have to do with job training and placement particularly for young people what need now be an end to the bickering here in the capital need the bipartisan comprehensive package of revenue increase and spending cut now before the congress need to be pass be not propose a quick fix an artificial stimulant to the economy such as have see in the several recession in recent|years the present recession be bottom out without resort to quick fix now there will not be a sudden boom or upsurge but slowly and surely will have a sound and last recovery base on solid value and increase productivity and an end to deficit spending may not be easy but be the good way the only way to real and lasting prosperity for all people think of have only have balanced budget in the|last|20|year let look forward to the|day when begin make payment to reduce the national debt instead of turn all over to child help start this economic recovery program last|year when tell representative want can help again whether be a republican a democrat or an independent by let know that want continue let know that understand that this legislation be a price worth pay for low interest rate economic recovery and more job the single most important question face tonight be do reduce deficit and interest rate by raise revenue from those who be not now pay fair share or do accept big budget deficit high interest rate and high unemployment simply because disagree on certain feature of a legislative package which offer hope for million of americans at home on the farm and in the workplace do tell these americans to give up hope that ship of state lie dead in the water because those entrust with man that ship can not agree on which sail to raise be within sight of the safe port of economic recovery do make port or go aground on the shoal of selfishness partisanship and just plain bullheadedness the measure the congress be about to vote on while not perfect in the eye of any of will bring closer to the goal of a balanced budget restore

speaking of those who build the awe inspire cathedral of medieval time say that in those|days people have conviction modern have only opinion and require something more than opinion say to build a gothic cathedral well over the|past|30|year the conviction of the german people have build a cathedral of democracy a great and glorious testament to ideal in america genuinely admire the free society that have build in only|a|few|decade and understand all the well what have accomplish because of own history americans speak with the deep reverence of those founding fathers and first citizen who

in many way in many place ideal be be test today be meet this|afternoon between important summit the gathering of lead industrial democracy at versailles and the assembly of the|atlantic|alliance here in bonn tomorrow critical and complex problem face but dilemma will be make easy if remember partnership be base on a common western heritage and a faith in democracy believe this partnership of the atlantic|alliance nation be motivate primarily by the search for peace — inner peace for citizen and peace among nation why inner peace because democracy allow for self expression respect man 's dignity and creativity operate by a rule of law not by terror or coercion be government with the consent of the govern as a result citizen of the atlantic|alliance enjoy an unprecedented level of material and spiritual well being and be free to find own personal peace also seek peace among nation the psalmist say seek peace and pursue well foreign policy be base on this principle and direct toward this end the noble objective of diplomacy be the patient and difficult task of reconcile adversary to peace and know all look forward to the|day when the only industry of man war]1 will be the research of historian but the simple hope for peace be not enough must remember something that friedrich|schiller say the most pious man can not stay in peace if do not please evil neighbor so there must be a method to search a method that recognize the danger and reality of the world during chancellor schmidt 's state visit to washington last|year say that republic be perch on a cliff of freedom be not say anything the german people do not already know live as do in the heart of a divide europe can see more clearly than other that there be government at peace neither with own people nor the world do not believe any reasonable observer can deny that there be a threat to both peace and freedom today be as stark as that gash of a border that separate the german people be menace by a power that openly condemn value and answer restraint with a relentless military buildup can not simply assume every nation want the peace that so earnestly desire the polish people would tell there be those who would use military force to repress other who want only basic human right the freedom fighter of afghanistan would tell as well that the threat of aggression have not recede from the world without a strengthened atlantic security the possibility of military coercion will be very great must continue to improve defense if be to preserve peace and freedom this be be there an echo in here laughter and applause but this preserve peace and freedom be not an impossible task for almost|40|year have succeed in deter war method have be to organize defensive capability both nuclear and conventional so that an aggressor could have no hope of military victory the alliance have carry strength not as a battle flag but as a banner of peace deterrence have keep that peace and must continue to take the step necessary to make deterrence credible this depend in part on a strong america a national effort entail sacrifice by the american people be now underway to make long overdue improvement in military posture the american people support this effort because understand how fundamental be to keep the peace so fervently desire also be resolve to maintain the presence of well equip and train force in europe and strategic force will be modernize and remain committed to the alliance by these action the people of the|united|state be say be with germany be not alone adversary would be foolishly mistaken should gamble that americans would abandon alliance responsibility no matter how severe the test alliance security depend on a fully credible conventional defense to which all ally contribute there be a danger that any conflict could escalate to a nuclear war strong conventional force can make the danger of conventional or nuclear conflict more remote reasonable strength in and of be not bad be honorable when use to maintain peace or defend deeply hold belief of the first chore be to fulfill commitment to each other by continue to strengthen conventional defense this must include improve the readiness of stand force and the ability of those force to operate as must also apply the west 's technological genius to improve conventional deterrence there can be no doubt that as an alliance have the mean to improve conventional defense people hold value of individual liberty and dignity that time and again have prove willing to defend economic energy vastly exceed that of adversary free system have produce technological advance that other system with stifle ideology can not hope to equal all of these resource be available to defense yes many of nation currently be experience economic difficulty yet must nevertheless guarantee that security do not suffer as a result have make stride in conventional defense over the|last|few|year despite economic problem and have disprove the pessimist who contend that effort be futile the more close the conventional gap the less the risk of aggression or nuclear conflict the soil of germany and of every other ally be of vital concern to each member of the alliance and this fundamental commitment be embody in the|north|atlantic|treaty but will be an empty pledge unless ensure that american force be ready to reinforce europe and europe be ready to receive be encourage by the recent agreement on wartime host nation support this pact strengthen ability to deter aggression in europe and demonstrate common determination to respond to attack just as each ally share fully in the security of the alliance each be responsible for shoulder a fair share of the burden now that of course often lead to a difference of opinion and criticism of alliance be as old as the partnership but voice have now be raise on both side of the atlantic that mistake the inevitable process of adjustment within the alliance for a dramatic divergence of interest some americans think that europeans be too little concerned for own security some would unilaterally reduce the number of american troop deploy in europe and in europe hear the idea that the american presence rather than contribute to peace either have no deterrent value or actually increase the risk that ally may be attack these argument ignore both the history and the reality of the transatlantic coalition let assure that the american commitment to europe remain steady and strong europe 's shore be shore europe 's border be border and will stand with in defense of heritage of liberty and dignity the american people recognize europe 's substantial contribution to joint security nowhere be that contribution more evident than here in the|federal|republic german citizen host the force of nation german soldier and reservist provide the backbone of nato 's conventional deterrent in the heartland of europe bundeswehr be a model for the integration of defense need with a democratic way of life and have not shrink from the heavy responsibility of accept the nuclear force necessary for deterrence ask help in fulfil another responsibility many american citizen do not believe that counterpart in europe especially young citizen really understand the united|states presence there now if will work toward explain the u.s. role to people on this side of the atlantic will explain to those on the other side in recent|month both in country and mine there have be renew public concern about the threat of nuclear war and the arm buildup know be not easy especially for the german people to live in the gale of intimidation that blow from the east if may quote heine again almost foretell the fear of nuclear war when write wild dark time be rumble toward and the prophet who wish to write a new apocalypse will have to invent entirely new beast and beast so terrible that the ancient animal symbol will seem like coo dove and cupid in comparison the nuclear threat be a terrible beast perhaps the banner carry in of the nuclear demonstration here in germany say best the sign read be afraid well know of no western leader who do not sympathize with that earnest plea to those who march for peace heart be with would be at the head of parade if believe march alone could bring about a more secure world and to the woman in filderstadt who spend a petition for peace to president brezhnev and let say would sign petition if think could bring about harmony understand genuine concern the woman of filderstadt and share the same goal the question be how to proceed must think through the consequence of how reduce the danger to peace those who advocate that unilaterally forego the modernization of force must prove that this will enhance security and lead to moderation by the other side in short that will advance rather than undermine the preservation of the peace the weight of recent history do not support this notion those who demand that renounce the use of a crucial element of deterrent strategy must show how this would decrease the likelihood of war be only by comparison with a nuclear war that the suffering cause by conventional war seem a less evil goal must be to deter war of any kind and those who decry the failure of arm control effort to achieve substantial result must consider where the fault lie would remind that be the|united|state that have propose to ban land base intermediate range nuclear missile the missile most threatening to europe be the|united|state that have propose and will pursue deep cut in strategic system be the west that have long seek the detailed exchange of information on force and effective verification procedure and be dictatorship not democracy that need militarism to control own people and impose system on other to those who have take a different viewpoint and who can not see this danger do not suggest that be ignorant be just that know so many thing that be not true in the west — germans americans other allies be deeply committed to continue effort to restrict the arm competition common sense demand that persevere invite those who genuinely seek effective and lasting arm control to stand behind the far reach proposal that have put forward in return pledge that will sustain the close of consultation with allies on november|18th outline a broad and ambitious arm control program element call for reduce land base intermediate range nuclear missile to on each side if carry out would eliminate the grow threat to western|europe pose by the u.s.s.r. 's modern ss-20 rocket and would make unnecessary the nato decision to deploy american intermediate range system and by the way can not understand why among some there be a great fear of weapon nato be to deploy than of weapon the|soviet|union already have deploy proposal be fair because impose equal limit and obligation on both side and call for significant reduction not merely a capping of an exist high level of destructive power as know have make this proposal in geneva where negotiation have be underway since intend to pursue those negotiation intensively regard as a significant test of the soviets ' willingness to enter into meaningful arm control agreement on may|9th propose to the|soviet|union that strategic arms reductions talks begin this|month in geneva the u.s.s.r. have agree and talk will begin on june|29th in the|united|state want to focus on the most destabilizing system and thus reduce the risk of war and that be why in the first phase propose to reduce substantially the number of ballistic missile warhead and the missile in the second phase will seek an equal ceiling on other element of strategic force include ballistic missile throwweight at less than current american level will handle cruise missile and bomber in an equitable fashion will negotiate in good faith and undertake these talk with the same seriousness of purpose that have mark preparation over another element of the program outline be a call for reduction in conventional force in europe from the western democracy have face the ominous reality that massive soviet conventional force would remain stationed where do not belong the muscle of soviet force in central|europe far exceed legitimate defense need presence be make more threatening still by a military doctrine that emphasize mobility and surprise attack and as history show these troop have build a legacy of intimidation and repression in response the nato ally must show have the will and capacity to deter any conventional attack or any attempt to intimidate yet also will continue the search for responsible way to reduce nato and warsaw|pact military personnel to equal level in recent|weeks in the alliance have consult on how good to invigorate the vienna negotiation on mutual and balanced|force|reduction base on these consultation western representative in the vienna talk soon will make a proposal by which the alliance would reduce respective ground force personnel in verifiable stage to a total of man and combined ground and air force personnel to a level of man while the agreement would not eliminate the threat nor spare citizen the task of maintain a substantial defense force could constitute a major step toward a safe europe for both east and west could lead to military stability at low level and lessen the danger of miscalculation and a surprise attack and also would demonstrate the political will of the alliance to enhance stability by limit force in the central area of military competition the west have establish a clear set of goal as an alliance will press forward with plan to improve own conventional force in europe at the same time propose an arm control agreement to equalize conventional force at a significantly low level will move ahead with preparation to modernize nuclear force in europe but again also will work unceasingly to gain acceptance in geneva of proposal to ban land base intermediate range nuclear missile in the|united|state will move forward with the plan announce last|year to modernize strategic nuclear force which play so vital a role in maintain peace by deter war yet also have propose that strategic arms reductions talks begin will pursue determinedly in each of these area policy be base on the conviction that a stable military balance at the low possible level will help further the cause of peace the other side will respond in good faith to these initiative only if believe be resolve to provide for own defense unless convinced that will unite and stay united behind these arm control initiative and modernization program adversary will seek to divide from another and people from leader be optimistic about relationship with the|soviet|union if the western nation remain true to value and true to each other believe in western civilization and moral power believe deeply in the principle the west esteem and guide by these ideal believe can find a no nonsense workable and last policy that will keep the peace earlier say the german people have build a remarkable cathedral of democracy but still have other work ahead must build a cathedral of peace where nation be safe from war and where people need not fear for liberty have hear the history of the famous cathedral of cologne — how those beautiful soar spire miraculously survive the destruction all around include part of the church let build a cathedral as the people of cologne build with the deep commitment and determination let build as do not just for

for grant gladstone defend the|reform|bill of declare can not fight against the future time be on side be easy to believe in the march of democracy in gladstone 's day in that high noon of victorian optimism be approach the end of a bloody century plague by a terrible political invention totalitarianism optimism come less easily today not because democracy be less vigorous but because democracy 's enemy have refine instrument of repression yet optimism be in order because day by day democracy be prove to be a not at all fragile flower from stettin on the baltic to varna on the|black|sea the regime plant by totalitarianism have have more|than|30|year to establish legitimacy but none — not regime have yet be able to risk free election regime plant by bayonet do not take root the strength of the solidarity movement in poland demonstrate the truth tell in an underground joke in the|soviet|union be that the|soviet|union would remain a party nation even if an opposition party be permit because everyone would join the opposition party laughter america 's time as a player on the stage of world history have be brief think understand this fact have always make patient with young cousin well not always patient do recall that on occasion sir winston|churchill say in exasperation about|one of most distinguished diplomat be the only case know of a bull who carry china shop with laughter but witty as sir winston be also have that special attribute of great statesman the gift of vision the willingness to see the future base on the experience of the past be this sense of history this understanding of the past that want to talk with about today for be in remember what share of the past that nation can make common cause for the future have not inherit an easy world if development like the|industrial|revolution which begin here in england and the gift of science and technology have make life much easy for have also make more dangerous there be threat now to freedom indeed to very existence that other generation could never even have imagine there be first the threat of global war no president no congress no prime minister no parliament can spend a day entirely free of this threat and do not have to tell that in today 's world the existence of nuclear weapon could mean if not the extinction of mankind then surely the end of civilization as know that be why negotiation on intermediate range nuclear force now underway in europe and the start talk strategic arms reduction talks which will begin later|this|month be not just critical to american or western policy be critical to mankind commitment to early success in these negotiation be firm and unshakable and purpose be clear reduce the risk of war by reduce the mean of wag war on both side at the same time there be a threat pose to human freedom by the enormous power of the modern state history teach the danger of government that overreach political control take precedence over free economic growth secret police mindless bureaucracy all combine to stifle individual excellence and personal freedom now be aware that among here and throughout europe there be legitimate disagreement over the extent to which the public sector should play a role in a nation 's economy and life but on point all of be unite abhorrence of dictatorship in all form but most particularly totalitarianism and the terrible inhumanity have cause in time the great purge auschwitz and dachau the gulag and cambodia historian look back at time will note the consistent restraint and peaceful intention of the west will note that be the democracy who refuse to use the threat of nuclear monopoly in the forty and early fifty for territorial or imperial gain have that nuclear monopoly be in the hand of the communist world the map of europe — indeed the world would look very different today and certainly will note be not the democracy that invade afghanistan or supresse polish|solidarity or use chemical and toxin warfare in afghanistan and southeast|asia if history teach anything teach self delusion in the face of unpleasant fact be folly see around today the mark of terrible dilemma — prediction of doomsday antinuclear demonstration an arm race in which the west must for own protection be an unwilling participant at the same time see totalitarian force in the world who seek subversion and conflict around the globe to further barbarous assault on the human spirit what then be course must civilization perish in a hail of fiery atom must freedom wither in a quiet deaden accommodation with totalitarian evil sir winston|churchill refuse to accept the inevitability of war or even that be imminent say do not believe that soviet russia desire war what desire be the fruit of war and the indefinite expansion of power and doctrine but what have to consider here today while time remain be the permanent prevention of war and the establishment of condition of freedom and democracy as rapidly as possible in all country well this be precisely mission today to preserve freedom as well as peace may not be easy to see but believe live now at a turning point in an ironic sense karl|marx be right be witness today a great revolutionary crisis a crisis where the demand of the economic order be conflict directly with those of the political order but the crisis be happen not in the free non - marxist west but in the home of marxist leninism the|soviet|union be the|soviet|union that run against the tide of history by deny human freedom and human dignity to citizen also be in deep economic difficulty the rate of growth in the national product have be steadily decline since the fifty and be less|than|half of what be then the dimension of this failure be astounding a country which employ one|fifth of population in agriculture be unable to feed own people be not for the private sector the tiny private sector tolerate in soviet agriculture the country may be on the brink of famine these private plot occupy a bare of the arable land but account for nearly|one quarter of soviet farm output and nearly|one third of meat product and vegetable overcentralize with little or no incentive year after year the soviet system pour good resource into the making of instrument of destruction the constant shrinkage of economic growth combine with the growth of military production be put a heavy strain on the soviet people what see here be a political structure that no longer correspond to economic base a society where productive force be hamper by political one the decay of the soviet experiment should come as no surprise to wherever the comparison have be make between free and closed society west|germany and east|germany austria and czechoslovakia malaysia and vietnam be the democratic country what be prosperous and responsive to the need of people and of the simple but overwhelming fact of time be this of all the million of refugee have see in the modern world flight be always away from not toward the communist world today on the nato line military force face east to prevent a possible invasion on the other side of the line the soviet force also face east to prevent people from leave the hard evidence of totalitarian rule have cause in mankind an uprising of the intellect and will whether be the growth of the new school of economic in america or england or the appearance of the so call new philosopher in france there be unifying thread run through the intellectual work of these group rejection of the arbitrary power of the state the refusal to subordinate the right of the individual to the superstate the realization that collectivism stifle all the good human impulse since the exodus from egypt historian have write of those who sacrifice and struggle for freedom the stand at thermopylae the revolt of spartacus the storming of the bastille the warsaw uprising in world|war|ii more recently have see evidence of this same human impulse in of the develop nation in central|america for months|and|month the world news medium cover the fighting in day|after|day be treat to story and film slant toward the brave freedom fighter battle oppressive government force in behalf of the silent suffer people of that torture country and then one|day those silent suffer people be offer a chance to vote to choose the kind of government want suddenly the freedom fighter in the hill be expose for what really be cuban back guerrilla who want power for and backer not democracy for the people threaten death to any who vote and destroy hundred of bus and truck to keep the people from get to the polling place but on election|day the people of an unprecedented of brave ambush and gunfire and trudge for mile to vote for freedom stand for hour in the hot sun wait for turn to vote member of congress who go there as observer tell of a woman who be wound by rifle fire on the way to the poll who refuse to leave the line to have wound treat until after have vote a grandmother who have be tell by the guerrilla would be kill when return from the poll and tell the guerrilla can kill can kill family kill neighbor but can not kill all the real freedom fighter of turn out to be the people of that country the young the old the in between strange but in own country there be be little if any news coverage of that war since the election now perhaps will say it's well because there be new struggle now on distant island in the|south|atlantic young man be fight for britain and yes voice have be raise protest sacrifice for lump of rock and earth so far away but those young man be not fight for mere real estate fight for a cause for the belief that armed aggression must not be allow to succeed and the people must participate in the decision of government—[applause]—the decision of government under the rule of law if there have be firm support for that principle some|45|years|ago perhaps generation would not have suffer the bloodletting of world|war|ii in the|middle|east now the gun sound once more this time in lebanon a country that for too long have have to endure the tragedy of civil war terrorism and foreign intervention and occupation the fighting in lebanon on the part of all party must stop and israel should bring force home but this be not enough must all work to stamp out the scourge of terrorism that in the|middle|east make war an ever present threat but beyond the troublespot lie a deep more positive pattern around the world today the democratic revolution be gather new strength in india a critical test have be pass with the peaceful change of govern political party in africa nigeria be move into remarkable and unmistakable way to build and strengthen democratic institution in the caribbean and central|america of country have freely elect government and in the|united|nation of the develop nation which have join that body in the|past|5|years be democracy in the communist world as well man 's instinctive desire for freedom and self determination surface again and again to be sure there be grim reminder of how brutally the police state attempt to snuff out this quest for self rule—1953 in east|germany in hungary in czechoslovakia in poland but the struggle continue in poland and know that there be even those who strive and suffer for freedom within the confine of the|soviet|union how conduct here in the western democracy will determine whether this trend continue no democracy be not a fragile flower still need cultivate if the rest of this|century be to witness the gradual growth of freedom and democratic ideal must take action to assist the campaign for democracy some argue that should encourage democratic change in right wing dictatorship but not in communist regime well to accept this preposterous notion as some well mean people have be to invite the argument that once country achieve a nuclear capability should be allow an undisturbed reign of terror over own citizen reject this course as for the soviet view chairman brezhnev repeatedly have stress that the competition of idea and system must continue and that this be entirely consistent with relaxation of tension and peace well ask only that these system begin by live up to own constitution abide by own law and comply with the international obligation have undertake ask only for a process a direction a basic code of decency not for an instant transformation can not ignore the fact that even without encouragement there have be and will continue to be repeat explosion against repression and dictatorship the|soviet|union be not immune to this reality any system be inherently unstable that have no peaceful mean to legitimize leader in such case the very repressiveness of the state ultimately drive people to resist if necessary by force while must be cautious about force the pace of change must not hesitate to declare ultimate objective and to take concrete action to move toward must be staunch in conviction that freedom be not the sole prerogative of a lucky few but the inalienable and universal right of all human being so state the united nations universal declaration of human rights which among other thing guarantee free election the objective propose be quite simple to state to foster the infrastructure of democracy the system of a free press union political party university which allow a people to choose own way to develop own culture to reconcile own difference through peaceful mean this be not cultural imperialism be provide the mean for genuine self determination and protection for diversity democracy already flourish in country with very different culture and historical experience would be cultural condescension or bad to say that any people prefer dictatorship to democracy who would voluntarily choose not to have the right to vote decide to purchase government propaganda handout instead of independent newspaper prefer government to worker control union opt for land to be own by the state instead of those who till want government repression of religious liberty a single political party instead of a free choice a rigid cultural orthodoxy instead of democratic tolerance and diversity since the|soviet|union have give covert political training and assistance to marxist leninist in many country of course also have promote the use of violence and subversion by these same force over west|european and other social|democrat christian|democrats and leader have offer open assistance to fraternal political and social institution to bring about peaceful and democratic progress appropriately for a vigorous new democracy the|federal|republic|of|germany 's political foundation have become a major force in this effort in america now intend to take additional step as many of ally have already do toward realize this same goal the chairman and other leader of the national republican and democratic|party organization be initiate a study with the bipartisan american political foundation to determine how the|united|state can best contribute as a nation to the global campaign for democracy now gather force will have the cooperation of congressional leader of both party along with representative of business labor and other major institution in society look forward to receive recommendation and to work with these institution and the congress in the common task of strengthen democracy throughout the world be time that commit as a nation in both the public and private sector to assist democratic development plan to consult with leader of other nation as well there be a proposal before the|council|of|europe to invite parliamentarian from democratic country to a meeting next|year in strasbourg that prestigious gathering could consider way to help democratic political movement this|november in washington there will take place an international meeting on free election and next|spre there will be a conference of world authority on constitutionalism and self goverment host by the chief justice of the|united|state authority from a number of develop and develop country — judge philosopher and politician with practical experience have agree to explore how to turn principle into practice and further the rule of law at the same time invite the|soviet|union to consider with how the competition of idea and value which be commit to support can be conduct on a peaceful and reciprocal basis for example be prepared to offer president brezhnev an opportunity to speak to the american people on television if will allow the same opportunity with the soviet people also suggest that panel of newsman periodically appear on each other 's television to discuss major event now do not wish to sound overly optimistic yet the|soviet|union be not immune from the reality of what be go on in the world have happen in the past a small ruling elite either mistakenly attempt to ease domestic unrest through great repression and foreign adventure or choose a wise course begin to allow people a voice in own destiny even if this latter process be not realize soon believe the renew strength of the democratic movement complement by a global campaign for freedom will strengthen the prospect for arm control and a world at peace have discuss on other occasion include address on may|9th the element of western policy toward the|soviet|union to safeguard interest and protect the peace what be describe now be a plan and a hope for the long term the march of freedom and democracy which will leave marxism leninism on the ash heap of history as have leave other tyranny which stifle the freedom and muzzle the self expression of the people and that be why must continue effort to strengthen nato even as move forward with zero option initiative in the negotiation on intermediate range force and proposal for a third reduction in strategic ballistic missile warhead military strength be a prerequisite to peace but let be clear maintain this strength in the hope will never be use for the ultimate determinant in the struggle that be now go on in the world will not be bomb and rocket but a test of will and idea a trial of spiritual resolve the value hold the belief cherish the ideal to which be dedicated the british people know that give strong leadership time and a little bit of hope the force of good ultimately rally and triumph over evil here among be the cradle of self government the|mother|of|parliaments here be the endure greatness of the british contribution to mankind the great civilized idea individual liberty representative government and the rule of law under god have often wonder about the shyness of some of in the west about stand for these ideal that have do so much to ease the plight of man and the hardship of imperfect world this reluctance to use those vast resource at command remind of the elderly lady whose home be bomb in the blitz as the rescuer move about find a bottle of brandy would store behind the staircase which be all that be leave stand and since be barely conscious of the worker pull the cork to give a taste of come around immediately and say here now — there now put back that be for emergency laughter well the emergency be upon let be shy no longer let go to strength let offer hope let tell the world that a new age be not only possible but probable during of the|second|world|war when this island be incandescent with courage winston|churchill exclaim about britain 's adversary what kind of a people do think be well britain 's adversary find out what extraordinary people the british be but all the democracy pay a terrible price for allow the dictator to underestimate dare not make that mistake again so let ask what kind of people do think be and let answer free people worthy of freedom and determine not only to remain so but to help other gain freedom as well sir winston lead people to great victory in war and then lose an election just as the fruit of victory be about to be enjoy but leave office honorably and as turn out temporarily know that the liberty of people be more important than the fate of any single leader history recall greatness in way no dictator will ever know and leave a message of hope for the future as timely now as when first utter as opposition leader in the commons nearly|27|years|ago when say

in newark and chicago to hard press farmer and small businessman and to million of everyday americans who harbor the simple wish of a safe and financially secure future for child to understand the state of the union must look not only at where be and where be go but where have be the situation at this time last|year be truly ominous the|last|decade have see a series of recession there be a recession in in and again in the|spring|of|1980 each time unemployment increase and inflation soon turn up again coin the word stagflation to describe this government 's response to these recession be to pump up the money supply and increase spending in the|last|6|months|of|1980 as an example the money supply increase at the fast rate in postwar history—13|percent inflation remain in double digit and government spending increase at an annual rate of interest rate reach a staggering there be unemployed late in sink into the present recession largely because continue high interest rate hurt the auto industry and construction and there be a drop in productivity and the already high unemployment increase this time however thing be different have an economic program in place completely different from the artificial quick fix of the past call for a reduction of the rate of increase in government spending and already that rate have be cut nearly in half but reduce spend the first and small phase of a tax rate reduction design to stimulate the economy and create job already interest rate be down to but must still go low inflation be down from to and for the|month|of|december be run at an annualize rate of if have not act as do thing would be far bad for all americans than be today inflation taxis and interest rate would all be high a|year|ago americans ' faith in governmental process be steadily decline out of americans be say be pessimistic about future a new kind of defeatism be hear some say domestic problem be uncontrollable that have to learn to live with this seemingly endless cycle of high inflation and high unemployment there be also pessimistic prediction about the relationship between administration and this congress be say could never work together well those prediction be wrong the record be clear and believe that history will remember this as an era of american renewal remember this administration as an administration of change and remember this congress as a congress of destiny together not only cut the increase in government spend nearly in half bring about the large tax reduction and the most sweeping change in tax structure since the|beginning|of|this|century and because index future taxis to the rate of inflation take away government 's build in profit on inflation and hidden incentive to grow large at the expense of american together after of take power away from the hand of the people in states and local community have start return power and resource to together have cut the growth of new federal regulation nearly|in|half in there be few page in the|federal|register which list new regulation than there be in by deregulate oil have come closer to achieve energy independence and help bring down the cost of gasoline and heating fuel together have create an effective federal strike force to combat waste and fraud in government in just|6|month have save the taxpayer more|than|$2|billion and be only get start together have begin to mobilize the private sector not to duplicate wasteful and discredit government program but to bring thousand of americans into a volunteer effort to help solve many of america 's social problem together have begin to restore that margin of military safety that ensure peace country 's uniform be be wear once again with pride together have make a new beginning but have only begin no one pretend that the way ahead will be easy in inaugural|address last|year warn that the ill suffer have come upon over several|decades will not go away in day week or month but will go away because as americans have the capacity now as have have in the past to do whatever need to be do to preserve this last and great bastion of freedom the economy will face difficult moment in the|months|ahead but the program for economic recovery that be in place will pull the economy out of slump and put on the road to prosperity and stable growth by the|latter|half|of|this|year and that be why can report to tonight that in the near future the state of the union and the economy will be well much well if summon the strength to continue on the course that have chart and so the question if the fundamental be in place what now well thing first must understand what be happen at the moment to the economy current problem be not the product of the recovery program that be only just now get underway as some would have believe be the inheritance of decade of tax and tax and spend and spend because economic problem be deeply rooted and will not respond to quick political fix must stick to carefully integrate plan for recovery that plan be base on commonsense fundamental continue reduction of the growth in federal spending preserve the individual and business tax reduction that will stimulate saving and investment remove unnecessary federal regulation to spark productivity and maintain a healthy dollar and a stable monetary policy the latter a responsibility of the|federal|reserve|system the only alternative be offer to this economic program be a return to the policy that give a dollar debt runaway inflation runaway interest rate and unemployment the doubter would have turn back the clock with tax increase that would offset the personal tax rate reduction already pass by this congress raise present taxis to cut future deficit tell well do not believe should buy that argument there be too many imponderable for anyone to predict deficit or surplus several|years|ahead with any degree of accuracy the budget in place when take office have be project as balance turn out to have of the big deficit in history another example of the imponderable that can make deficit projection highly questionable a change of only|one percentage point in unemployment can alter a deficit up or down by some|$25|billion as now stand forecast which be require by law to make will show major deficit start at less|than|a|hundred|billion|dollar and decline but still too high more important be make progress with the key to reduce deficit economic growth low interest rate and spend control the policy have in place will reduce the deficit steadily surely and in time completely high taxis would not mean low deficit if do how would explain that tax revenue more than double just since yet in that same period run the large series of deficit in history in tax revenue increase by and in have of all time big deficit raise taxis will not balance the budget will encourage more government spending and less private investment raise taxis will slow economic growth reduce production and destroy future job make more difficult for those without job to find and more likely that those who now have job could lose so will not ask to try to balance the budget on the back of the american taxpayer will seek no tax increase this|year and have no intention of retreat from basic program of tax relief promise to bring the american people to bring tax rate down and to keep down to provide incentive to rebuild economy to save to invest in america 's future will stand by word tonight be urge the american people seize these new opportunity to produce to save to invest and together will make this economy a mighty engine of freedom hope and prosperity again now the budget deficit this|year will exceed early expectation the recession do that lower revenue and increase cost to some extent be also victim of own success have bring inflation down faster than think could and in do this have deprive government of those hide revenue that occur when inflation push people into high income tax bracket and the continue high interest rate last|year cost the government about|$5|billion more than anticipate must cut out more nonessential government spending and rout out more waste and will continue effort to reduce the number of employee in the federal work force by the budget plan submit to on february|8th will realize major saving by dismantle the|departments|of|energy|and|education and by eliminate ineffective subsidy for business will continue to redirect resource to high budget priority a strong national defense to keep america free and at peace and a reliable safety net of social program for those who have contribute and those who be in need contrary to some of the wild charge may have hear this administration have not and will not turn back on america 's elderly or america 's poor under the new budget fund for social insurance program will be more than double the amount spend only|6|years|ago but would be foolish to pretend that these or any program can not be make more efficient and economical the entitlement program that make up safety net for the truly needy have worthy goal and many deserve recipient will protect but there be only|one way to see to that these program really help those whom be design to help and that be to bring spiral cost under control today face the absurd situation of a federal budget with quarter of expenditure routinely refer to as uncontrollable and a large part of this go to entitlement program committee after committee of this congress have hear witness after witness describe many of these program as poorly administer and rife with waste and fraud virtually every american who shop in a local supermarket be aware of the daily abuse that take place in the food stamp program which have grow by in the|last|15|years another example be medicare and medicaid — program with worthy goal but whose cost have increase from to almost|60|billion more|than|5 time as much in just|10|year waste and fraud be serious problem back in federal investigator testify before of committee that corruption have permeate virtually every area of the medicare and medicaid health care industry official say many of the people who be cheat the system be very confident that nothing be go to happen to well something be go to happen not only the taxpayer be defraud the people with real dependency on these program be deprive of what need because available resource be go not to the needy but to the greedy the time have come to control the uncontrollable in august make a start sign a bill to reduce the growth of these program by over the|next|3|years while at the same time preserve essential service for the truly needy shortly will receive from a message on further reform intend to install some new but other long recommend by own congressional committee ask to help make these saving for the american taxpayer the saving propose in entitlement program will total some|$63|billion over 4|year and will without affect social t security go a long way toward bring federal spending under control but do not be fool by those who proclaim that spending cut will deprive the elderly the needy and the helpless the federal|government will still subsidize 95|million meal every day that be out of of all the meal serve in america head start senior nutrition program and child welfare program will not be cut from the level propose last|year more|than|one half dollar have be propose for minority business assistance and research at the|national|institute|of|health will be increase by over|$100|million while meet all these need intend to plug unwarranted tax loophole and strengthen the law which require all large corporation to pay a minimum tax be confident the economic program have put into operation will protect the needy while trigger a recovery that will benefit all americans will stimulate the economy result in increase saving and provide capital for expansion mortgage for homebuilding and job for the unemployed now that the essential of that program be in place next major undertaking must be a program — just as bold just as innovative to make government again accountable to the people to make system of federalism work again citizen feel have lose control of even the most basic decision make about the essential service of government such as school welfare road and even garbage collection and be right a maze of interlock jurisdiction and level of government confront average citizen in try to solve even the simple of problem do not know where to turn for answer who to hold accountable who to praise who to blame who to vote for or against the main reason for this be the overpower growth of federal grant in aid program during the|past|few|decade in the|federal|government have categorical grant program cost when take office there be approximately|500 cost nearly|a|hundred|billion dollars—13 program for energy for pollution control for social service for education and here in the congress take at|least|166 committee just to try to keep track of know and know that neither the president nor the congress can properly oversee this jungle of grant in aid indeed the growth of these grant have lead to the distortion in the vital function of government as democratic governor put recently the|national|government should be worry about arm control not pothole the growth in these federal program have in the word of intergovernmental commission make the|federal|government more pervasive more intrusive more unmanageable more ineffective and costly and above all more un accountable let solve this problem with a single bold stroke the return of some|$47|billion in federal program to state and local government together with the mean to finance and a transition period of nearly|10|year to avoid unnecessary disruption will shortly send this congress a message describe this program want to emphasize however that full detail will have be work out only after close consultation with congressional state and local official start in fiscal|1984 the|federal|government will assume full responsibility for the cost of the rapidly grow medicaid program to go along with exist responsibility for medicare as part of a financially equal swap the states will simultaneously take full responsibility for aid|to|families|with|dependent|children and food stamp this will make welfare less costly and more responsive to genuine need because will be design and administer closer to the grass root and the people serve in the|federal|government will apply the full proceed from certain excise taxis to a grass root trust fund that will belong in fair share to the states the total amount flow into this fund will be a year over the|next|4|years the states can use this money in either of way if want to continue receive federal grant in such area as transportation education and social service can use trust fund money to pay for the grant or to the extent choose to forgo the federal grant program can use trust fund money on own for those or other purpose there will be a mandatory pass through of part of these fund to local government by the states will be in complete control of over federal grant program the trust fund will start to phase out eventually to disappear and the excise taxis will be turn over to the states can then preserve low or raise taxis on own and fund and manage these program as see fit in a single stroke will be accomplish a realignment that will end cumbersome administration and spiral cost at the federal level while ensure these program will be more responsive to both the people be mean to help and the people who pay for hand in hand with this program to strengthen the discretion and flexibility of state and local government be propose legislation for an experimental effort to improve and develop depressed urban area in the 's and ' this legislation will permit states and locality to apply to the|federal|government for designation as urban enterprise zone a broad range of special economic incentive in the zone will help attract new business new job new opportunity to america 's inner city and rural town some will say mission be to save free enterprise well say must free enterprise so that together can save america some will also say states

issue of gold certificate should not for the present be resume and suggest that the national bank may properly be forbid by law to retire currency except upon reasonable notice of intention so to do such legislation would seem to be justify by the recent action of certain bank on the occasion refer to in thesecretary 's report of the fifteen|million of fractional currency still outstanding only|about|eighty|thousand have be redeem the|past|year the suggestion that this amount may properly be drop from future statement of the public debt seem worthy of approval so also do the suggestion

of unmanufactured wool and in that of scrap and pig iron the value of import sugar on the other hand show an increase of of steel rail barley and of steel in bar ingot contrast with the import during the|last|fiscal|year the export be as follow domestic merchandise foreign merchandise total import of merchandise excess of export over import of merchandise aggregate of export and import compare with the|previous|year there be an increase of in the value of export of merchandise and a decrease of in the value of import the annual average of the excess of import of merchandise over export

such export over import be reach during the|year|1864 when amount to but during the|year|ended|june|30,|1880 the import of coin and bullion exceed the export by and during the|last|fiscal|year the excess of import over export be in the last annual report of the secretary of the treasury the attention of congress be call to the fact that in bond and in bond would become redeemable during the|year and congress be ask to authorize the refunding of these bond at a low rate of interest the bill for such refunding have fail to become a law the secretary of the treasury in april last notify the holder of the bond then outstanding that the bond would be pay at par on the|1st|day|of|july follow or that may be continue at the pleasure of the government to bear interest at the rate of per cent per annum under this notice of the bond be continue at the low rate and be redeem in the|month|of|may a like notice be give respect the redemption or continuance of the of bond then outstanding

redemption of bond total the per cent bond be payable at the pleasure of the government be available for the investment of surplus revenue without the payment of premium unless these bond can be fund at a much low rate of interest than now bear agree with the secretary of the treasury that no legislation respect be desirable be a matter for congratulation that the business of the country have be so prosperous during the|past|year as to yield by taxation a large surplus of income to the government if the revenue law remain unchanged this surplus must year by year increase on account of the reduction of the public debt and burden of interest and because of the rapid increase of population in just prior to the institution of internal revenue system population but slightly exceed by the census of be now find to exceed be estimate that even if the annual receipt and expenditure should continue as at present the entire debt could be pay in ten|year in view however of the heavy load of taxation which people have already bear may well consider whether be not the part of wisdom to reduce the revenue even if delay a little the payment of the debt seem to that the time have arrive when the people may justly demand some relief from present onerous burden and that by due economy in the various branch of the public service this may readily be afford therefore concur with the secretary in recommend the abolitionof all internal revenue taxis except those upon tobacco in variousform and upon distilled spirit and ferment liquor and except alsothe special tax upon the manufacturer of and dealer in such article the retention of the latter tax be desirable as afford the officersof the government a proper supervision of these article for the preventionof fraud agree with the secretary of the treasury that the law imposinga stamp tax upon match proprietary article play card cheek and draft may with propriety be repeal and the law also by which banksand banker be assess upon capital and deposit there seem tobe a general sentiment in favor of this course in the present condition of revenue the tax upon deposit be especially unjust be never impose in this country until be demand by the necessity of war and be never exact believe in any other country even in great exigency bank be require to secure circulation by pledge with the treasurer of bond of the generalgovernment the interest upon these bond which at the time when the tax be impose be be now in most instance per cent besides the entire circulation be originally limit by law and no increase be allowable when the exist bank have practically a monopoly of the business there be force in the suggestion that for the franchise to the favor grantee the government may very properly exact a tax on circulation;but for year the system have be free and the amount of circulation regulate by the public demand the retention of this tax have be suggest as a means of reimburse the government for the expense of print and furnish the circulate note if the tax should be repeal would certainly seem proper to require the national bank to pay the amount of such expense to the comptroller of the currency be perhaps doubtful whether the immediate reduction of the rate of taxation upon liquor and tobacco be advisable especially in view of the drain upon the treasury which must attend the payment of arrear of pension a comparison however of the amount of taxis collect under the vary rate of taxation which have at different time prevail suggest the intimation that some reduction may soon be make without material diminution of the revenue the tariff law also need revision but that a due regard may be pay to the conflicting interest of citizen important change should be make with caution if a careful revision can not be make at this session a commission such as be lately approve by the senate and be now recommend by the secretary of the treasury would doubtless lighten the labor ofcongress whenever this subject shall be bring to consideration the accompanying report of the secretary of war will make known to the operation of that department for the|past|year suggest measure for promote the efficiency of the army without add to the number of officer and recommend the legislation necessary to increase the number of enlisted man to the maximum allow bylaw this deem necessary to maintain quietude on ever shift frontier;to preserve peace and suppress disorder and marauding in new protect settler and property against indians and indians against the encroachment of intruder and to enable peaceable immigrant to establish home in the most remote part of country the army be now necessarily scatter over such a vast extent of territory that whenever an outbreak occur reenforcement must be hurry from many|quarter over great distance and always at heavy cost for transportation of man horse wagon and supply concur in the recommendation of the secretary for increase thearmy to the strength of enlisted man appear by the secretary 's report that in the absence of disturbance on the frontier the troop have be actively employ in collect theindians hitherto hostile and locate on proper reservations;that sitting|bull and adherent be now prisoner at fort randall;that the utes have be move to new reservation in utah that during the recent outbreak of the apaches be necessary to reenforce the garrison in arizona by troop withdraw from new|mexico and that some of the apaches be now hold prisoner for trial while some have escape and the majority of the tribe be now on reservation there be need of legislation to prevent intrusion upon the land set apart for the indians a large military force at great expense be now require to patrol the boundary line between kansas and the only punishment that can at present be inflict be the forcible removal of the intruder and the imposition of a pecuniary fine which in most case be impossible to collect there should be a penalty by imprisonment in such case the separate organization of the|signal|service be urge by the secretary of war and a full statement of the advantage of such permanent organization be present in the report of the chief signal officer a detailed account of the useful work perform by and the|weather|bureau be also give in that report ask attention to the statement of the secretary of war

condition of that branch of the service and present valuable suggestion for improvement call especial attention also to the append report of the advisoryboard which convene to devise suitable measure for increase the efficiency of the navy and particularly to report as to the character and number of vessel necessary to place upon a footing commensurate with the necessity of the government can not too strongly urge upon conviction that every consideration of national safety economy and honor imperatively demand a thorough rehabilitation of navy with a full appreciation of the fact that compliance with the suggestion of the head of that department and of must involve a large expenditure of the public money earnestly recommend such appropriation as will accomplish an end which seem to so desirable nothing can be more inconsistent with true public economy than withhold the mean necessary to accomplish the object intrust by the constitution to the|national|legislature of those object and one which be of paramount importance be declare by fundamental law to be the provision for the common defense surely nothing be more essential to the defense of the|united|state and of all people than the efficiency of navy have for many|year maintain with foreign government the relation of honorable peace and that such relation may be permanent be desire by every patriotic citizen of the republic but if heed the teaching of history shall not forget that in the life of every nation emergency may arise when a resort to arm can alone save from dishonor no danger from abroad now threaten this people nor have any cause to distrust the friendly profession of other government but for avoid as well as for repel danger that may threaten in the future must be prepared to enforce any policy which think wise to adopt must be ready to defend harbor against aggression to protect by the distribution of ship of war over the highway of commerce the varied interest of foreign trade and the

of modify the present system of the court of the|united|state a necessity dueto the large increase of business especially in the|supreme|court litigation in federal tribunal become greatly expand after the close of the late war so long as that expansion may be attributable to the abnormal condition in which the community find immediately after the return of peace prudence require that no change be make in the constitution of judicial tribunal but have now become apparent that an immense increase of litigation have directly result from the wonderful growth and development of the country there be no ground for belief that the business of the|united|state court will ever be less in volume than at present indeed that be likely to be much great be generally recognize by the bench and bar in view of the fact that congress have already give much consideration to this subject make no suggestion as to detail but express the hope that deliberation may result in such legislation as will give early relief to overburdened court the acting attorney general also call attention to the disturbance of the public tranquillity during the|past|year in the|territory|of|arizona a band of

depredation of these cowboys have also extend intomexico which the marauder reach from the arizona frontier with every disposition to meet the exigency of the case be embarrass by lack of authority to deal with effectually the punishment of crime commit within arizona should ordinarily of course be leave to the territorial authority but be worthy consideration whether act which necessarily tend to embroil the|united|state with neighboring government should not be declare crime against the|united|state some of the incursion allude to may perhaps be within the scope of the law sec forbid military expedition or enterprise against friendly state but in view of the speedy assembling of body have prefer to await such legislation as in wisdom the occasion may seem to demand may perhaps be think proper to provide that the setting on foot within own territory of brigandage and armed marauding expedition against friendly nation and citizen shall be punishable as an offense against the|united|state will add that in the event of a request from the territorial government for protection by the|united|state against domestic violence this government would be powerless to render assistance the|act|of|1795 chapter pass at a time when territorial government receive little attention from congress enforce this duty of the unitedstates only as to the state government but the act of chapter also to territories this law seem to have remain in force until the revision of the statute when the provision for the territories be drop be not advise whether this alteration be intentional or accidental but as seem to that the territories should be offer the protection which be accord to the staten by the constitution suggest legislation to that end seem to too that whatever view may prevail as to the policy of recent legislation by which the army have cease to be a part of the posse comitatus an exception may well be make for permit the military to assist the civil territorial authority in enforce the law of the|united|state this use of the army would not seem to be within the alleged evil against which that legislation be aim from sparseness of population and other circumstance be often quite impracticable to summon a civil posse in place where officer of justice require assistance and where a military force be within easy reach the report of the secretary of the interior with accompany document present an elaborate account of the business of that department a summary of would be too extended for this place ask careful attention to the report prominent among the matter which challenge the attention of congress at present session be the management of indian affair while this question have be a cause of trouble and embarrassment from the infancy of the government be but recently that any effort have be make for solution at once serious determined consistent and promise success have be easy to resort to convenient makeshift for tide over temporary difficulty than to grapple with the great permanent problem and accordingly the easy course have almost invariably be pursue be natural at a time when the national territory seem almost illimitable and contain many|millions|of|acre far outside the bound of civilized settlement that a policy should have be initiate which more than aught else have be the fruitful source of indian complication refer of course to the policy of deal with the various indian tribe as separate nationality of relegate by treaty stipulation to the occupancy of immense reservation in the west and of encourage to live a savage life undisturbed by any earnest and well direct effort to bring under the influence of civilization the unsatisfactory result which have spring from this policy be become apparent to all as the white settlement have crowd the border of the reservation the indians sometimes contentedly and sometimes against will have be transfer to other hunting ground from which have again be dislodge whenever new find home have be desire by the adventurous settler these removal and the frontier collision by which have often be precede have lead to frequent and disastrous conflict between the race be profitless to discuss here which of have be chiefly responsible for the disturbance whose recital occupie so large a space upon the page of history have to deal with the appal fact that though thousand of life have be sacrifice and hundreds|of|millions|of|dollars expend in the attempt to solve the indian problem have until within the|past|few|year seem scarcely nearer a solution than be half|a|century|ago but thegovernment have of late be cautiously but steadily feel way to the adoption of a policy which have already produce gratifying result and which in judgment be likely if congress and the executive accord in support to relieve ere long from the difficulty which have hitherto beset for the success of the effort now make to introduce among the indians the custom and pursuit of civilized life and gradually to absorb into the mass of citizen share right and holden to responsibility there be imperative need for legislative action suggestion in that regard will be chiefly such as have be already call to the attention of congress and have receive to some extent consideration first recommend the passage of an act make the law of the variousstate and territories applicable to the indian reservation within border and extend the law of the|state|of|arkansas to the portion of the indian territory not occupy by the|five|civilized|tribes the indian should receive the protection of the law should be allow to maintain in court right of person and property have repeatedly beg for this privilege exercise would be very valuable to in progress toward civilization second of even great importance be a measure which have be frequently recommend by predecessor in office and in furtherance of which several bill have be from time to time introduce in both houses|of|congress the enactment of a general law permit the allotment in severalty to such indians at least as desire of a reasonable quantity of land secure to by patent and for own protection make inalienable for twenty|or|twenty five|years be demand for present welfare and permanent advancement in return for such considerate action on the part of the government there be reason to believe that the indians in large number would be persuade to sever tribal relation and to engage at once in agricultural pursuit many of realize the fact that hunting|day be over and that be now for good interest to conform manner of life to the new order of thing by no great inducement than the assurance of permanent title to the soil can be lead to engage in the occupation of till the well attest report of increase interest in husbandry justify the hope and belief that the enactment of such a statute as recommend would be at once attend with gratify result a resort to the allotment system would have a direct and powerful influence in dissolve the tribal bond which be so prominent a feature of savage life and which tend so strongly to perpetuate third advise a liberal appropriation for the support of indian school because of confident belief that such a course be consistent with the wise economy even among the most uncultivated indian tribe there be report to be a general and urgent desire on the part of the chief and old member for the education of child be unfortunate in view of this fact that during the|past|year the mean which have be at the command of the|interior|department for the purpose of indian instruction have prove to be utterly inadequate the success of the school which be in operation at hampton carlisle and forest grove should not only encourage a more generous provision for the support of those institution but should prompt the establishment of other of a similar character be doubtless much more potent for good than the|day school upon the reservation as the pupil be altogether separate from the surrounding of savage life and bring into constant contact with civilization there be many other phase of this subject which be of great interest but which can not be include within the become limit of this communication be discuss ably in the report of the secretary of the interior and the commissioner of indian|affairs for many|years the executive in annual message to congress have urge the necessity of stringent legislation for the suppression of polygamy in the territories and especially in the|territory|of|utah the exist statute for the punishment of this odious crime so revolt to the moral and religious sense of christendom have be persistently and contemptuously violate ever since enactment indeed in spite of commendable effort on the part of the authority who represent the|united|state in thatterritory the law have in very rare instance be enforce and for a cause to which reference will presently be make be practically a dead letter the fact that adherent of the|mormon|church which rest upon polygamy as corner stone have recently be people in large number idaho arizona and other of our|western|territorie be well calculate to excite the lively interest and apprehension impose upon congress and theexecutive the duty of array against this barbarous system all the power which under the constitution and the law can wield for destruction reference have be already make to the obstacle which the united|state officer have encounter in effort to punish violation of law prominent among these obstacle be the difficulty of procure legal evidence sufficient to warrant a conviction even in the case of the most notorious offender attention be call to a recent opinion of the|supreme|court of the|united|state explain judgment of reversal in the case of miles who have be convict of bigamy in utah the court refer to the fact that the secrecy attend the celebration of marriage in that territory make the proof of polygamy very difficult and the propriety be suggest of modify the law of evidence which now make a wife incompetent to testify against husband this suggestion be approve recommend also the passage of an act provide that in the|territories|of|the|united|state the fact that a woman have be marry to a person charge with bigamy shall not disqualify as a witness upon trial for that offense further recommend legislation by which any person solemnize a marriage in any of the territories shall be require under stringent penalty for neglect or refusal to file a certificate of such marriage in the supreme court of the territory doubtless|congress may devise other practicable measure for obviate the difficulty which have hitherto attend the effort to suppress this iniquity assure of determined purpose to cooperate with in any lawful and discreet measure which may be propose to that end although system of government do not contemplate that the nation should provide or support a system for the education of people no measure calculate to promote that general intelligence and virtue upon which the perpetuity of institution so greatly depend have ever be regard with indifference by congress or the executive a large portion of the public domain have be from time to time devote to the promotion of education there be now a special reason why by set apart the proceed of sale of public land or by some other course the government should aid the work of education many who now exercise the right of suffrage be unable to read the ballot which cast upon many who have just emerge from a condition of slavery be suddenly devolve the responsibility of citizenship in that portion of the country most impoverish by war have be pleased to learn from the report of the commissioner of education that there have lately be a commendable increase of interest and effort for instruction but all that can be do by local legislation and private generosity should be supplement by such aid as can be constitutionally afford by would suggest that if any fund be dedicate to this purpose maybe wisely distribute in the different state accord to the ratio of illiteracy as by this mean those locality which be most in need of such assistance will reap special benefit the report of the commissioner of agriculture exhibit the result of the experiment in which that department have be engage during the|past|year and make important suggestion in reference to the agricultural development of the country the steady increase of population and the consequent addition to the number of those engage in the pursuit of husbandry be give to this department a grow dignity and importance the commissioner 's suggestion touch capacity for great usefulness deserve attention as more and more commend to the interest which be create to promote appear from the report of the commissioner of pensions that since1860 original pension claim have be file of these have be allow and inscribe on the pension roll have be reject and abandon be + per cent of the whole number of claim settle there be now pende for settlement original pension claims,227,040 of which be file prior to july|1,|1880 these when allow will involve the payment of arrear from the date of discharge in case of an invalid and from date of death or termination of a prior right in all other case from all the datum obtainable be estimate that of the number of claim now pende will be reject or abandon this would show the probable rejection of case and the probable admission of about|193,000 claim all of which involve the payment of arrear of pension with the present force employ the number of adjudication remain the same and no new business intervene this number of claim be act upon in a|period|of|six|year and take january|1 a near period from which to estimate in each case an average amount of arrear be find that every case allow would require for the first payment upon the sum of multiply this amount by the whole number of probable admission give as the sum require for first payment this represent the sum which must be pay upon claim which be file before july|1,|1880 and be now pende and entitle to the benefit of the arrear act from this amount may be deduct from ten|to|fifteen|millions for case where the claimant dying there be no person who under the law would be entitle to succeed to the pension leave as the probable amount to be pay in these estimate no account have be take of the case file since june|30,|1880 and now pende which must receive attention as current business but which do not involve the payment of any arrear beyond the date of file the claim of this number be estimate that will be allow as have be state with the present force of be estimate that will take six|year to dispose of the claim now pende be state by the commissioner of pensions that by an addition of250 clerk increase the adjudicate force rather than the mechanical)double the amount of work could be accomplish so that these case could be act upon within three|year aside from the consideration of justice which may be urge for a speedy settlement of the claim now on the file of the|pension|office be no less important on the score of economy inasmuch as fully third of the clerical force of the office be now wholly occupy in give attention to correspondence with the thousand of claimant whose case have be on the file for the fact that a sum so enormous must be expend by the government to meet demand for arrear of pension be an admonition to congress and the executive to give cautious consideration to any similar project in the future the great temptation to the presentation of fictitious claim afford by the fact that the average sum obtain upon each application be lead to suggest the propriety of make some special appropriation for the prevention of fraud advise appropriation for such internal improvement as the wisdom of congress may deem to be of public importance the necessity of improve the navigation of the mississippi|river justify a special allusion to that subject suggest the adoption of some measure for the removal of obstruction which now impede the navigation of that great channel of commerce in letter accept the nomination for the vice presidency state that in judgment-- no man should be the incumbent of an office the duty of which be for any cause unfit to perform who be lack in the ability fidelity or integrity which a proper administration of such office demand this sentiment would doubtless meet with general acquiescence but opinion have be widely divide upon the wisdom and practicability of the various reformatory scheme which have be suggest and of certain propose regulation govern appointment to public office the efficiency of such regulation have be distrust mainly because have seem to exalt mere educational and abstract test above general business capacity and even special fitness for the particular work in hand seem to that the rule which should be apply to the management of the public service may properly conform in the main to such as regulate the conduct of successful private business original appointment should be base upon ascertained fitness the tenure of office should be stable position of responsibility should so far as practicable be fill by the promotion of worthy and efficient officer the investigation of all complaint and the punishment of all official misconduct should be prompt and thorough the view express in the foregoing letter be those which will govern administration of the executive office be doubtless share by all intelligent and patriotic citizen however divergent in opinion as to the good method of put into practical operation for example the assertion that original appointment should be base upon ascertained fitness be not open to dispute but the question how in practice such fitness can be most effectually ascertain be which have for year excited interest and discussion the measure which with slight variation in detail have lately be urge upon the attention of congress and the executive have as principal feature the scheme of competitive examination save for certain exception which need not here be specify this plan would allow admission to the service only in low grade and would accordingly demand that all vacancy in high position should be fill by promotion alone in these particular be in conformity with the exist civil service system of great|britain and indeed the success which have attend that system in the country of birth be the strong argument which have be urge for adoption here the fact should not however be overlook that there be certain feature of the english system which have not generally be receive with favor in this country even among the foremost advocate of civil service reform among be a tenure of office winch be substantially a life tenure a limitation of the maximum age at which an applicant can enter the service whereby all man in middle life or old be with some exception rigidly exclude a retire allowance upon go out of office these element be as important factor of the problem as any of the other to eliminate from the english system would effect a most radical change in theory and practice the avowed purpose of that system be to induce the educate young man of the country to devote life to public employment by an assurance that have once enter upon need never leave and that after voluntary retirement shall be the recipient of an annual pension that this system as an entirety have prove very successful in great|britain seem to be generally concede even by those who once oppose adoption to a statute which should incorporate all essential feature should feel bind to give approval but whether would be for the good interest of the public to fix upon an expedient for immediate and extensive application which embrace certain feature of the english system but exclude or ignore other of equal importance may be seriously doubt even by those who be impress as be with the grave importance of correct the evil which inhere in the present method of appointment if for example the english rule which shut out person above the|age|of|25|year from a large number of public employment be not to be make an essential part of own system be questionable whether the attainment of the high number of mark at a competitive examination should be the criterion by which all application for appointment should be put to test and under similar condition may also be question whether admission to the service should be strictly limit to low rank there be very many characteristic which go to make a model civil servant prominent among be probity industry good sense good habit good temper patience order courtesy tact self reliance manly deference to superior officer and manly consideration for inferior the absence of these trait be not supply by wide knowledge of book or by promptitude in answer question or by any other quality likely to be bring to light by competitive examination to make success in such a contest therefore an indispensable condition of public employment would very likely result in the practical exclusion of the old applicant even though may possess qualification far superior to young and more brilliant competitor these suggestion must not be regard as evince any spirit of opposition to the competitive plan which have be to some extent successfully employ already and which may hereafter vindicate the claim of most earnest supporter but ought to be seriously consider whether the application of the same educational standard to person of mature year and to young man fresh from school and college would not be likely to exalt mere intellectual proficiency above other quality of equal or great importance another feature of the propose system be the selection by promotion of all officer of the government above the low grade except such as would fairly be regard as exponent of the policy of the executive and the principle of the dominant party to afford encouragement to faithful public servant by exciting in mind the hope of promotion if be find to merit be much to be desire but would be wise to adopt a rule so rigid as to permit no other mode of supply the intermediate walk of the service there be many person who fill subordinate position with great credit but lack those quality which be requisite for high post of duty;and besides the mode of thought and action of whose service in a governmental bureau have be long continue be often so cramp by routine procedure as almost to disqualify from institute change require by the public interest an infusion of new blood from time to time into the middle rank of the service may be very beneficial in result the subject under discussion be of grave importance the evil which be complain of can not be eradicate at once the work must be gradual the present english system be a growth of year and be not create by a single stroke of executive or legislative action beginning be find in an order in council promulgate in 1855,and be after patient and cautious scrutiny of working that fifteen|years|later take present shape five|year after the issuance of the order in council and at a time when resort have be have to competitive examination as an experiment much more extensively than have yet be the case in this country a select committee of the|house|of|common make a report to that house which declare approval of the competitive plan deprecate nevertheless any precipitancy in general adoption as likely to endanger ultimate success during this tentative period the result of the method of pass examination and competitive examination be closely watch and compare may be that before confine upon this important question within the stringent bound of statutory enactment may profitably await the result of further inquiry and experiment the submission of a portion of the nomination to a central board of examiner select solely for test the qualification of applicant may perhaps without resort to the competitive test put an end to the mischief which attend the present system of appointment and may be feasible to vest in such a board a wide discretion to ascertain the characteristic and attainment of candidate in those particular which have already refer to as be no less important than mere intellectual attainment if congress should deem advisable at the present session to establish competitive test for admission to the service no doubt such as have be suggest shall deter from give the measure earnest support and urgently recommend should there be a failure to pass any other act upon this subject that an appropriation of per year may be make for the enforcement of section|1753|of|the|revised|statute with the aid thus afford shall strive to execute the provision of that law accord to letter and spirit be unwilling in justice to the present civil servant of the government to dismiss this subject without declare dissent from the severe and almost indiscriminate censure with which have be recently assail that be as a class indolent inefficient and corrupt be a statement which have be often make and widely credit but when the extent variety delicacy and importance of duty be consider the great majority of the employee of the government be in judgment deserve of high commendation the continue decline of the merchant marine of the|united|state be greatly to be deplore in view of the fact that furnish so large a proportion of the freight of the commercial world and that shipment be steadily and rapidly increase be cause of surprise that not only be navigation interest diminishing but be less than when export and import be not half so large as now either in bulk or value there must be some peculiar hindrance to the development of this interest or the enterprise and energy of american mechanic and capitalist would have keep this country at least abreast of rival in the friendly contest for ocean supremacy the substitution of iron for wood and of steam for sail have work great revolution in the carry trade of the world but these change could not have be adverse to america if have give to navigation interest a portion of the aid and protection which have be so wisely bestow upon manufacture commend the whole subject to the wisdom of congress with the suggestion that no question of great magnitude or farther reach importance can engage attention in the|supreme|court of the|united|state declare unconstitutional the statute of certain states which impose upon shipowner or consignee a tax of for each passenger arrive from a foreign country or in lieu thereof require a bond to indemnify the state and local authority against expense for the future relief or support of such passenger since this decision the expense attend the care and supervision of immigrant have fall on the states at whose port have land as a large majority of such immigrant immediately upon arrival proceed to the inlandstate and the territories to seek permanent home be manifestly unjust to impose upon the state whose shore first reach the burden which now bear for this reason and because of the national importance of the subject recommend legislation regard the supervision and transitory care of immigrant at the port of debarkation regret to state that the people of alaska have reason to complain that be as yet unprovide with any form of government by which life or property can be protect while the extent of population do not justify the application of the costly machinery of territorial administration there be immediate necessity for constitute such a form of government as will promote the education of the people and secure the administration of justice the senate at last session pass a bill provide for the construction of a building for the|library|of|congress but fail to become a law the provision of suitable protection for this great collection of book and for the copyright department connect with have become a subject of national importance and should receive prompt attention the report of the|commissioners|of|the|district|of|columbia herewith transmit will inform fully of the condition of the affair of thedistrict urge the vital importance of legislation for the reclamation and improvement of the marsh and for the establishment of the harbor line along the potomac|river front be represent that in present condition these marsh seriously affect the health of the resident of the adjacent part of the city and that greatly mar the general aspect of the park in which stand thewashington|monument this improvement would add to that park and to the park south of the|executive|mansion a large area of valuable land and would transform what be now believe to be a dangerous nuisance into an attractive landscape extend to the river front recommend the removal of the steam railway line from the surface of the street of the city and the location of the necessary depot in such place as may be convenient for the public accommodation and call attention to the deficiency of the water supply which seriously affect the material prosperity of the city and the health and comfort of inhabitant commend these subject to favorable consideration the importance of timely legislation with respect to the ascertainment and declaration of the vote for presidential elector be sharply call to the attention of the people more|than|four|years|ago be to be hope that some well define measure may be devise before another national election which will render unnecessary a resort to any expedient of a temporary character for the determination of question upon contest return question which concern the very existence of the government and the liberty of the people be suggest by the prolonged illness of the late president and consequent incapacity to perform the function of office be provide by the second article of the constitution in the fifth clause of first section that in case of the removal of the president from office or of death resignation or inability to discharge the power and duty of the said office the same shall devolve on the vice president what be the intendment of the constitution in specification of inability to discharge the power and duty of the said office as of the contingency which call the vice president to the exercise of presidential function be the inability limit in nature to long continue intellectual incapacity or have a broad import what must be extent and duration how must existence be establish have the president whose inability be the subject of inquiry any voice in determine whether or not exist or be the decision of that momentous and delicate question confide to the vice president or be contemplate by the constitution that congress should provide by law precisely what should constitute inability and how and by what tribunal or authority should be ascertain if the inability prove to be temporary in nature and during continuance the vice president lawfully exercise the function of theexecutive by what tenure do hold office do continue as president for the remainder of the|four|years ' term or would the elect president if inability should cease in the interval be empower to resume office and if have such lawful authority should exercise would thevice president be thereupon empower to resume power and duty as such can not doubt that these important question will receive early and thoughtful consideration deeply impressed with the gravity of the responsibility which have so unexpectedly devolve upon will be constant purpose to cooperate with in such measure as will promote the glory of the country and the prosperity of people transcript officers lady and gentleman of the|national|press|club and as of a very short time ago fellow member back in april while in the hospital have as can readily understand a lot of time for reflection and decide to send a personal handwritten letter to soviet president leonid|brezhnev remind that have meet about|10|years|ago in san|clemente california as and president nixon be conclude a series of meeting that have bring hope to all the world never have peace and good will seem close at hand would like to read a few paragraph from that letter “ mr. president when meet ask if be aware that the hope and aspiration of million of people throughout the world be dependent on the decision that would be reach in those meeting take hand in both of and assure that be aware of that and that be dedicate with all heart and soul and mind to fulfil those hope and dream go on in letter to say “ the people of the world still share that hope indeed the people of the world despite difference in racial and ethnic origin have very much in common want the dignity of have some control over individual life destiny want to work at the craft or trade of own choosing and to be fairly reward want to raise family in peace without harm anyone or suffering harm government exist for convenience not the other way around “ if be incapable as some would have believe of self government then where among do find any who be capable of govern other “ be possible that have permit ideology political and economic philosophy and governmental policy to keep from consider the very real everyday problem of people will the average soviet family be well off or even aware that the|soviet|union have impose a government of own choice on the people of afghanistan be life well for the people of cuba because the cuban military dictate who shall govern the people of angola “ be often imply that such thing have be make necessary because of territorial ambition of the|united|state that have imperialistic design and thus constitute a threat to own security and that of the newly emerge nation not only be there no evidence to support such a charge there be solid evidence that the|united|stat when could have dominate the world with no risk to make no effort whatsoever to do so “ when world|war|ii end the|united|states have the only undamaged industrial power in the world military may be at peak and alone have the ultimate weapon the nuclear weapon with the unquestioned ability to deliver anywhere in the world if have seek world domination then who could have oppose “ but the|united|states follow a different course unique in all the history of mankind use power and wealth to rebuild the war ravish economy of the world include those of the nation who have be enemy may say there be absolutely no substance to charge that the|united|states be guilty of imperialism or attempt to impose will on other country by use of force continue letter by say or conclude letter should say — by say mr. president should not be concern with eliminate the obstacle which prevent people those and represent from achieve most cherished goal well be in the same spirit that want to speak today to this audience and the people of the world about america 's program for peace and the come negotiation which begin november|30th in geneva switzerland specifically want to present program for preserve peace in europe and wide program for arm control twice in lifetime have see the people of europe plunge into the tragedy of war twice in lifetime europe have suffer destruction and military occupation in war that statesman prove powerless to prevent soldier unable to contain and ordinary citizen unable to escape and twice in lifetime young americans have bleed life into the soil of those battlefield not to enrich or enlarge domain but to restore the peace and independence of friend and allies all of who live through those trouble time share a common resolve that must never come again and most of share a common appreciation of the|atlantic|alliance that have make a peaceful free and prosperous western|europe in the post - war era possible but today a new generation be emerge on both side of the atlantic member be not present at the creation of the|north|atlantic|alliance many of do not fully understand root in defend freedom and rebuild a war tear continent some young people question why need weapon particularly nuclear weapon to deter war and to assure peaceful development fear that the accumulation of weapon may lead to conflagration some even propose unilateral disarmament understand concern question deserve to be answer but have an obligation to answer question on the basis of judgment and reason and experience policy have result in the long european peace in this|century would not a rash departure from these policy as some now suggest endanger that peace from founding have preserve the peace through unity deterrence and dialog first and ally have stand unite by the firm commitment that an attack upon any of would be consider an attack upon all second and ally have deter aggression by maintain force strong enough to ensure that any aggressor would lose more from an attack than could possibly gain and third and ally have engage the soviets in a dialog about mutual restraint and arm limitation hope to reduce the risk of war and the burden of armament and to lower the barrier that divide east from west these element of policy have preserve the peace in europe for more|than|a|third of a century can preserve for generation to come so long as pursue with sufficient will and vigor today wish to reaffirm america 's commitment to the|atlantic|alliance and resolve to sustain the peace and from conversation with ally leader know that also remain true to this try and prove course nato ’s policy of peace be base on restraint and balance no nato weapon conventional or nuclear will ever be use in europe except in response to attack nato ’s defense plan have be responsible and restrain the allies remain strong united and resolute but the momentum of the continue soviet military buildup threaten both the conventional and the nuclear balance consider the fact over the|past|decade the|united|state reduce the size of armed|force and decrease military spending the soviets steadily increase the number of man under arm now number more than double those of the|united|state over the same period the soviets expand real military spending by about|one third the|soviet|union increase inventory of tank to some|50,000 compare to historically a land power transform navy from a coastal defense force to an open ocean fleet while the|united|state a sea power with transoceanic alliance cut fleet in half during a period when nato deploy no new intermediate range nuclear missile and actually withdraw nuclear warhead the|soviet|union deploy more|than|750 nuclear warhead on the new ss20 missile alone response to this relentless buildup of soviet military power have be restrain but firm have make decision to strengthen all leg of the strategic triad sea- land- and air base have propose a defense program in the|united|state for the|next|5|year which will remedy the neglect of the|past|decade and restore the erode balance on which security depend would like to discuss more specifically the grow threat to western|europe which be pose by the continue deployment of certain soviet intermediate range nuclear missile the|soviet|union have different type such missile system the ss20 the ss-4 and the ss-5 all with the range capable of reach virtually all of western|europe there be other soviet weapon system which also represent a major threat now the only answer to these system be a comparable threat to soviet threat to soviet target in other word a deterrent prevent the use of these soviet weapon by the counterthreat of a like response against own territory at present however there be no equivalent deterrent to these soviet intermediate missile and the soviet continue to add new ss-20 a|week to counter this the allies agree in as part of a track decision to deploy as a deterrent land base cruise missile and pershing|ii missile capable of reach target in the|soviet|union these missile be to be deploy in several country of western|europe this relatively limited force in no way serve as a substitute for the much large strategic umbrella spread over nato allies rather provide a vital link between conventional short range nuclear force in europe and intercontinental force in the|united|state deployment of these system will demonstrate to the|soviet|union that this link can not be break deter war depend on the perceive ability of force to perform effectively the more effective force be the less likely be that will have to use so and ally be proceed to modernize nato 's nuclear force of intermediate range to meet increase soviet deployment of nuclear system threaten western|europe let turn now to hope for arm control negotiation there ’s a tendency to make this entire subject overly complex want to be clear and concise tell of the letter write to president brezhnev last|april well have just send another message to the soviet leadership ’ a simple straightforward yet historic message the|united|state propose the mutual reduction of conventional intermediate range nuclear and strategic force specifically have propose a point agenda to achieve this objective in letter to president brezhnev the first and most important point concern the geneva negotiation as part of the track decision nato make a commitment to seek arm control negotiation with the|soviet|union on intermediate range nuclear force the|united|state have be prepare for these negotiation through close consultation with nato partner be now ready to set forth proposal have inform president brezhnev that when delegation travel to the negotiation on intermediate range land base nuclear missile in geneva on the|30th|of|this|month representative will present the follow proposal the|united|states be prepared to cancel deployment of pershing|ii and ground launch cruise missile if the soviets will dismantle ss-20 ss-4 and ss-5 missile this would be an historic step with soviet agreement could together substantially reduce the dread threat of nuclear war which hang over the people of europe this like the first footstep on the moon would be a giant step for mankind now intend to negotiate in good faith and go to geneva willing to listen to and consider the proposal of soviet counterpart but let call to attention the background against which proposal be make during the|past|6|years while the|united|state deploy no new intermediate range missile and withdraw nuclear warhead from europe the|soviet|union deploy warhead on mobile accurate ballistic missile now have warhead on the ss-20s ss-4s and and the|united|states have no comparable missile indeed the|united|states dismantle the last such missile in europe over as look to the future of the negotiation be also important to address certain soviet claim which leave unrefuted could become critical barrier to real progress in arm control the soviets assert that a balance of intermediate range nuclear force already exist that assertion be wrong by any objective measure as this chart indicate the|soviet|union have develop an increasingly overwhelming advantage now enjoy a superiority on the order of the red be the soviet buildup the blue be own that is and that be now soviet

of money be still not out of the wood but have make a start and have certainly surprise those longtime and somewhat cynical observer of the washington scene who look listen and say can never be do washington will never change spending habit well something very exciting have be happen here in washington and be responsible voice have be hear million of democrats republicans and independents from every profession trade and line of work and from every part of this land send a message that want a new beginning want to change little little word letter word should say do not sound like much but

the|federal|government have spend more than take in there will be another large deficit in this|present|year which end september|30th but with program in place will not be quite as big as may have be and start next|year the deficit will get small until in just|a|few|year the budget can be balance and hope can begin whittle at that almost|$1|trillion debt that hang over the future of child now so far have be talk about only part of program for economic recovery the budget cut part do not minimize importance just the fact that democrats and republicans could work together as have prove the strength of system have create an optimism in land the rate of inflation be no longer in double digit figure the dollar have regain strength in the international money market and businessman and investor be make decision with regard to industrial development modernization and expansion all of this base on anticipation of program be adopt and put into operation a recent poll show that where a|year|and|a|half|ago only|24|percent of people believe thing would get well today believe will to justify faith must deliver the other part of program economic package be a closely knit carefully construct plan to restore america 's economic strength and put nation back on the road to prosperity each part of this package be vital can not be consider piecemeal be propose as a package and have be support as such by the american people only if the congress pass all of major component do have any real chance of success this be absolutely essential if be to provide incentive and make capital available for the increase productivity require to provide real permanent job for people and let not forget that the rest of the world be watch america carefully to see how will act at this critical moment have recently return from a summit meeting with world leader in ottawa canada and the message hear from be quite clear ally depend on a strong and economically sound america and be watch event in this country particularly those surround program for economic recovery with close attention and great hope in short the good way to have a strong foreign policy abroad be to have a strong economy at home the day after tomorrow,|wednesday the|house|of|representatives will begin debate on tax bill and once again need to hear from know that do not give much time but a great deal be at stake a|few|days|ago be visit here in the office by a democratic congressman from of southern states would be back in district and of constituent ask where stand on economic recovery program outline that program in an early broadcast particularly the tax cut well the congressman who happen to be a strong leader in support of program reply at some length with a discussion of the technical point involve but also mention a few reservation have on certain point the constituent a farmer listen politely until would finish and then say do not give an essay what want to know be be for be or agin be well appreciate the gentleman 's support and suggest question be a message own representative should hear let add those representative honestly and sincerely want to know feeling get plenty of input from the special interest group would like to hear from home folk now let explain what the situation be and what be at issue with budget cut have present a complete program of reduction in tax rate again purpose be to provide incentive for the individual incentive for business to encourage production and hiring of the unemployed and to free up money for investment bill call for a reduction in the income tax rate by october|1st a 10-percent reduction beginning july|1st,|1982 and another 10-percent cut a|year|later a 25-percent total reduction over 3|year but then to ensure the tax cut be permanent call for index the tax rate in which mean adjust for inflation as be now if get a cost of living raise that be intend to keep even with inflation find that the increase in the number of dollar get may very likely move into a high tax bracket and wind up poorer than would this be call bracket creep bracket creep be an insidious tax let give an example if earn a year in by have to earn just to stay even with inflation but that be before taxis come april|15th will find tax rate have increase now if have be wonder why do not seem as well off as be a|few|years|back be because government make a profit on inflation get an automatic tax increase without have to vote on intend to stop that time will not allow to explain every detail but bill include just about everything to help the economy reduce the marriage penalty that unfair tax that have a work husband and wife pay more tax than if be single increase the exemption on the inheritance or estate tax to so that farmer and family own business do not have to sell the farm or store in the event of death just to pay the taxis most important wipe out the tax entirely for a survive spouse no longer for example will a widow have to sell the family source of income to pay a tax on husband 's death there be deduction to encourage investment and saving business get realistic depreciation on equipment and machinery and there be tax break for small and independent business which create of all new job this bill also provide major credit to the research and development industry these credit will help spark the high technology breakthrough that be so critical to america 's economic leadership in the world there be also add incentive for small business include a provision that will lift much of the burden of costly paperwork that government have impose on small business in addition there be short term but substantial assistance for the hard pressed thrift industry as well as reduction in oil taxis that will benefit new or independent oil producer and move nation a step closer to energy self sufficiency bill be in short the first real tax cut for everyone in almost|20|year now when first propose this incidentally have now become a bipartisan measure coauthore by republican barber|conable and democrat kent|hance — the democratic leadership say a tax cut be out of the question would be wildly inflationary and that be before inauguration and then voice begin to hear and suddenly in february the leadership discover that well a tax cut be feasible well keep on push tax cut and by june the opposition find that a tax cut may work now be july and find could even go for a|third|year cut provide there be a trigger arrangement that would only allow to go into effect if certain economic goal have be meet by but by hold the people 's tax reduction hostage to future economic event will eliminate the people 's ability to plan ahead shopkeeper farmer and individual will be deny the certainty must have to begin save or invest more of money and encourage more saving and investment be precisely what need now to rebuild economy there be also a little sleight of hand in that trigger mechanism see bill the committee bill ensure that the deficit will be great than own trigger require as stand now the design of own bill will not meet the trigger have put in therefore the|third|year tax cut will automatically never take place if could paraphrase a well know statement by will|roger that have never meet a man do not like be afraid have some people around here who never meet a tax do not hike tax proposal similar in a number of way to but differ in some very vital part be pass out of the|house|ways|and|means|committee and from now on will refer to as the committee bill and ours as the bipartisan bill will be the bill take up wednesday the majority leadership claim give a great break to the worker than our and do that is if your're only plan to live 2|more|year the plain truth be choice be not between|two plan to reduce taxis be between a tax cut or a tax increase there be now build into present system include payroll social security taxis and the bracket creep have mention a 22-percent tax increase over the|next|3|years the committee bill offer a 15-percent cut over bipartisan bill give a 25-percent reduction over 3|year now as can see by this chart there be the 22-percent tax increase cut be below that line but ours wipe out that increase and with a little to spare and there be as can see the red column that be the 15-percent tax cut and still leave with an increase the green column be bipartisan bill which wipe out the tax increase and give an ongoing cut incidentally claim that cut taxis for individual for as|much|as|3|years|ahead be risky ring a little hollow when realize that bill call for business tax cut each|year for ring even more hollow when consider the fact the majority leadership routinely endorse federal spending bill that project year into the future but object to a tax bill that will return money over a period now here be another chart which illustrate what say about give a well break if only intend to live for 2|more|year tax cut so call be the dotted line be the solid line as can see in an earn bracket of tax cut be slightly more generous than our for the|first|2|years then as can see tax bill the dotted line start go up and up and up on the other hand in bipartisan tax bill the solid line tax cut keep on go down and then stay down permanently this be true of all earn bracket — not just the level that have use as an example from the low to the high this red space between the line be the tax money that will remain in pocket if bill pass and be the amount that will leave pocket if tax bill be pass now take no pleasure in say this but those who will seek to defeat conable hanee bipartisan bill as debate begin wednesday be the one who have give tax cut in the|last|10|years but taxis go up in those|same|10|year the line on these chart say a lot about who be really fight for whom on the hand see a genuine and lasting commitment to the future of work americans on the other just another empty promise those of in the bipartisan coalition want to give this economy and the future of this nation back to the people because put people first have always be america 's secret weapon the house majority leadership seem less concerned about protect family budget than with spend more on the federal budget bipartisan tax bill target quarter of tax relief to middle income wage earner who presently pay almost|three quarter of the total income tax also then index the tax bracket to ensure that can keep that tax reduction in the|years|ahead there also be as say estate tax relief that will keep family farm and family own business in the family and there be provision for personal retirement plan and individual saving account because bipartisan bill be so clearly draw and broadly base provide the kind of predictability and certainty that the financial segment of society need to make investment decision that stimulate productivity and make economy grow even more important if the tax cut go to the american people in the|third|year that money return to will not be available to the congress to spend and that in view be what this whole controversy come down to be entitled to the fruit of own labor or do government have some presumptive right to spend and spend and spend be also convince business tax cut be superior to because be more equitable and will do a much well job promote the surge in investment so badly need to rebuild industrial base there be something else want to tell bipartisan coalition work out a tax bill feel would provide incentive and stimulate productivity thus reduce inflation and provide job for the unemployed that be only goal opponent in the beginning do not want a tax bill at all so what be the purpose behind change of heart have put a tax program together for reason only to provide with a political victory never mind that will not solve the economic problem confront country never mind that will not get the wheel of industry turn again or eliminate the inflation which be eat alive this be not the time for political fun and game this be the time for a new beginning ask now to put aside any feeling of frustration or helplessness about political institution and join in this dramatic but responsible plan to reduce the enormous burden of federal taxation on and family during recent|month many of have ask what can do to help make america strong again urge again to contact senator and congressmen tell of support for this bipartisan proposal tell believe this be an unequalled opportunity to help return america to prosperity and make government again the servant of the people in a|few|days the congress will stand at the fork of road road be all too familiar to lead ultimately to high taxis merely bring full circle back to the source of economic problem where the government decide that know better than what should be do with earning and in fact how should conduct life the other road promise to renew the american spirit be a road of hope and opportunity place the direction of life back in hand where belong have not take time this evening merely to ask to trust instead ask to trust yourself that be what america be all about struggle for nationhood unrelenting fight for freedom very existence these have all rest on the assurance that must be free to shape life as be best able to that no one can stop from reach higher or take from the creativity that have make america the envy of mankind road be timid and fearful the other bold and hopeful in these|6|month have do so much and have come so far be be the power of million of people like who have determine that will make america great again have make the difference up to now will make the difference again let not stop now thank god bless and good night & nbsp

minority poor because hope have fail as surely as the federal program that build those hope but must not be the only who question about government policy can the black teenager who face a staggering unemployment rate feel that government policy be a success can the black wage earner who see more and more of take home pay shrink because of government taxis feel satisfied can black parent say despite a massive influx of federal aid that educational standard in school have improve appreciably can the woman see on television recently whose family have be on welfare for generation and who fear that child may be the fourth can believe that current government policy will save child from such a fate ask these tough question because share concern about the future of the black community ask these question because the black of america should not be patronize as just more voting bloc to be woo and win be individual as all be some have special need do not think the|federal|government have meet those need have be listen to the specific need of many people black farmer refugee union member woman small business man and woman and other group they're commonly refer to as special interest group well in reality be all member of the interest group that speak of the|day take the oath of office be the people of america and be pleased to serve that special interest group the people of the inner city will be represent by this administration every bit as much as the citizen of flagstaff arizona ithaca new|york or dixon illinois where grow up anyone who become president realize must represent all the people of the land not just those of a home state or a particular party nor can be just president of those who vote for but do not matter what group belong to what area live in how much or how little earn the economy affect every single of regardless of other interest and affiliation have proceed full throttle on economic recovery program because a strong grow economy without inflation be the sure most equitable way to ease the pressure on all the segment of society the well being of black like the well being of every other american be link directly to the health of the economy for example industry in which black have make sufficient gain in employment — substantial gain like auto and steel have be particularly hard hit and last hire first fire be a familiar refrain to too many black worker and do not need to tell this group what inflation have do to those who can least afford a decline economy be a poisonous gas that claim first victim in poor neighborhood before float out into the community at large therefore in national debate over budget and tax proposal shall not concede the moral high ground to the proponent of those policy that be responsible in the first place for economic mess a mess which have injure all americans will not concede the moral high ground to those who show more concern for federal program than do for what really determine the income and financial health of black the nation 's economy now know have be tell that proposal for economic recovery be design to discriminate against all who be economically deprive now those who say that could be confuse by the misstatement that have be make by some who be either ignorant of the fact or those who be practice for political reason pure demagoguery rebuilding america 's economy be an absolute moral imperative if be to avoid split this society in with class against class do not intend to let america drift further toward economic segregation must change the economic direction of this country to bring more black into the mainstream and must do now and in before have the equality know today langston|hughes write let|america|be|america|again and write oh yes see say plain america never be america to and yet swear this oath— america will be america will be that be the philosophy the people proclaim in last|november 's election america will be and this time will be for everyone together can recreate for every citizen the same economic opportunity that see lift up a land of immigrant people the kind of opportunity that have sweep the hungry and the persecute into the mainstream of life since the american experiment begin to a number of black americans the u.s. economy have be something of an underground railroad have spirit away from poverty to middle class prosperity and beyond but too many black still remain behind a glance at the statistic will show that a large proportion of the black people have not find economic freedom nationwide for example of black family in have money income under harriet|tubman who be know as the conductor of that early underground railroad say on first escape from slavery when find have cross that line look at hand to see if be the same person there be such a glory over everything even after a|century the beauty of word be powerful can only imagine the soaring of soul what a feeling that must have be when cross into freedom and the physical and mental shackle fall from person harriet|tubman 's glory be the glory of the american experience be a glory which have no color or religious preference or nationality be simply eloquently the universal thirst that all people have for freedom well there be poor people in this country who should experience just such an elation if find the economic freedom of a solid job a productive job not concoct by government and dependent on washington wind a real job where could put in a good day 's work complain about the boss and then go home with confidence and self respect why have this nation be unable to fill such a basic admirable need the government can provide subsistence yes but seldom move people up the economic ladder and as have say before have to get on the ladder before can move up on believe many in washington over the|year have be more dedicated to make needy people government dependent rather than independent have create a new kind of bondage because regardless of how honest intention in the beginning those set out to help soon become client essential to the well being of those who administer the program an honest program would be dedicate to make people independent no longer in need of government assistance but then what would happen to those who make a career of help well americans have be very generous with good intention and billions|of|dollar toward those believe be live in hardship and yet in spite of the hope the government have never live up to the dream of poor people just as free black people today need to declare an economic emancipation genuinely and deeply believe the economic package have put forth will move toward black economic freedom because be aim at lift an entire country and not just part of there be a truth to the word speak by john|f.|kennedy that a rise tide lift all boat yes know be be say what about the fellow without a boat who can not swim well believe john|kennedy 's figure of speech be refer to the benefit which accrue to all when the economy be flourish now much have be say and write not all of flatter — about the saving have propose in the budget which be adopt by the house last|friday can assure that the budget saving have advocate be much more equitable than the tremendous cut in social program make by inflation and the decline economy which can not find job for almost|8|million man and woman who be unemployed those cut be exact without regard to need or age let give some example in the prosperity of the 's an era of only a few federal program cost very little the number of people live in poverty be reduce by nearly|50|percent during the stagflation of the 's with many federal program with huge budget the number live in poverty be reduce by only|6|percent in the 's black unemployment fall from to in the 's increase from to what be more relative to the white unemployment rate black unemployment fall more in the 's but rise more in the 's the decline economy have cut black family income from the median family income of black after adjust for inflation rise at per year but from income actually drop now these be hard economic fact which be hard to take because show massive amount of government aid and intervention have fail to produce the desire result a strong economy return the great good to the black population return a benefit great than that provide by specific federal program by slow the growth of government and by limit the tax burden and thus stimulate investment will also be reduce inflation and unemployment will be create job nearly|3|million additional new job by will be aid minority business which have be particularly hard hit by the scarcity of capital and the prohibitive interest rate and these concern be what the bipartisan tax cut proposal currently before the congress be all about say the other day in conversation in the|oval|office that the income a year or ago do not have the most recent figure for the black community be something like now in most neighborhood what really bring prosperity be when the income of that neighborhood be then multiply by turn over several time within that community must tell that in the black community in america the turnover be less than once before the dollar those go out into the community at large and that have to be change in the convention last|summer benjamin|hooks the one that miss — well no this be the|republican|convention make that — benjamin hooks say to the assemble delegate must decide as a nation if be to become prisoner of past or possessor of an enlightened and progressive future those be the very word want to say to today can not be tie to the old way of solve economic and racial problem but be time look to new answer and new way of thinking that will accomplish the very end the new deal and the|great|society anticipate be not repeal the gain of black people be solidify those gain and make safe for child and grandchild be time that find way to make the american economic pie big instead of just cut an ever small pie into more but small slice be time welcome those americans into the circle of prosperity to let share in the wonder of society and be time to break the cycle of dependency that have become the legacy of so many federal program that no longer work indeed some of which never do work let give an idea of how bountiful this famous economic pie could have be by now if productivity have not stop grow and then start downhill after the gross national product today would be big enough to balance the budget cut personal and social security taxis in half and still provide every american with an extra in spend money and all of this would have happen with the compliment of the private sector now wisely learn to harness the|federal|government in the hard pull toward equality and that be right because guarantee equality of treatment be government 's proper function but as of statistic just read indicate government be no longer the strong draft horse of minority progress because have attempt to do too many thing be not equip to do ask if be not time to hitch up a fresh horse to finish the task free enterprise be a powerful workhorse that can solve many problem of the black community that government alone can no longer solve the black leadership of this nation have show tremendous courage both physical and intellectual and great creativity as seek to bring equality to people in this audience be the inheritor of that proud black heritage be the black leader of today and believe possess the very same courage and creativity ask to use that courage and creativity to examine the challenge that be face not just black but all of america ask to question the status quo as predecessor do and look for new and imaginative way to overcome minority problem be talk about the kind of courage and question chairman margaret|bush|wilson show in take the heat for the naacp 's controversial energy statement a statement which shake the elitist of country back into the real world at least for a time what be ask to consider require not so much a leap of faith but a realization that the|federal|government alone be just not capable of do the job all want do for or any other americans in the|months|ahead as the administration be free to turn attention from the economic program to other need of america will be advance proposal on a number of issue of concern to this convention the inner city for example should be community neighborhood not warehouse of despair where child be bus out and ineffectual federal fund be bus in believe that with the aid of commonsense government assistance and the use of free enterprise zone with less reliance on bus and more reliance on well basic education and with an emphasis on local activism such as represent community can be reinvigorate certainly be all inspire by the wonderful example of marva|collins in chicago the gallant lady who have the educational grit to make shakespeare admirer out of inner city child just prove to what a friend of mine wilson|riles california 's superintendent of education use to say the concept that black child can not learn unless be sit among white child be utter and complete nonsense now dr. riles be not suggest that integration be not a good and proper thing be and be good for all of when be bring about with commonsense and attention to what be good for the child plan to take a look a comprehensive look at the education of black from primary school upward and strengthen the base of black college which be a sound educational investment be more than that be a proud tradition a symbol of black determination and accomplishment and feel deeply must be preserve have increase the share of department|of|education title fund spend on black college and that trend will continue have equal concern for the black business leader of today minority business development as indicate earlier be a key to black economic progress black own business be especially important in neighborhood economy where the dollar as say spend have a beneficial multipli effect want input expect domestic adviser to be in regular touch with as policy evolve may not always agree but new idea be often spark by opinion clash do not come here today bear the promise of government handout which other have bring and which have rightly learn to mistrust instead ask to join to build a coalition for change year ago the famous call go forth the call for a conference emphasize the civil and political right of black and the result of that call of course be the|national|association|for|the|advancement|of|colored|people well today let issue a call for new perspective on the economic challenge face black americans let issue a call for exciting program to spring america forward toward the|next|century an america full of new solution to old problem will link hand to build an era where can put fear behind and hope in front of can be an era in which program be less important than opportunity can be an era where all reach out in reconciliation instead of anger and dispute in the war in vietnam a live grenade fall among a group of american soldier be freeze with horror know be only|second away from death then young soldier a black throw on the grenade cover with helmet and body die to save comrade great glory hath no man congressional medal of honor winner posthumously present garfield|langhorn 's last whisper word be have to care let care let work to build a nation that be free of racism full of opportunity and determine to loosen the creative energy of every person of every race of every station to make a well life will be honor to stand alongside to answer this call thank view transcript transcript father hesburgh thank very much and for so many thing the distinguished honor that have confer upon here today must say however compound a sense of guilt that have nurse for almost|50|year think the first degree be give be honorary but be wonderful to be here today with governor orr governor bowen senators lugar and quayle and representative|hiler these distinguished honoree the trustee administration faculty student and friend of notre|dame and most important the graduate class of & nbsp nancy and be greatly honor to share this|day with and pleasure have be more than double because be also share the platform with a longtime and very dear friend pat|o'brien pat and have not be able to see much of each other lately so have not have a chance to tell that there be now another tie that bind together until a|few|weeks|ago know very little about father 's ancestry have be orphan at age|6 but now have learn that grandfather great grandfather leave ireland to come to america leave home in ballyporeen a village in county|tipperary in ireland and have learn that ballyporeen be the ancestral home of the o'briens now if do not watch out this may turn out to be less of a commencement than a warm bath in nostalgic memory grow up in illinois be influence by a sport legend so national in scope be almost mystical be difficult to explain to anyone who do not live in those time the legend be base on a combination of element a game football a university notre|dame and a man knute|rockne there have be nothing like before or since first time to ever see notre|dame be to come here as a sport announcer 2|year out of college to broadcast a football game win or would not have mention a number of years|later return here in the company of pat|o'brien and a galaxy of hollywood star for the world premiere of knute|rockne — all|american in which be privilege to play george|gipp have always suspect that there may have be many actor in hollywood who could have play the part better but no one could have want to play more than do and be give the part largely because the star of that picture pat|o'brien kindly and generously hold out a help hand to a begin young actor have come from the world of sport would be try to write a story about knute|rockne must confess that have someone in mind to play the gipper on of sport broadcast before go to hollywood have tell the story of career and tragic death do not have very many word on paper when learn that the studio that employ be already prepare a story treatment for that film and that bring to the theme of remark be the fifth president of the|united|state to address a notre|dame commencement the temptation be great to use this forum as an address on a great international or national issue that have nothing to do with this occasion indeed this be somewhat traditional so be not surprised when read in several reputable journal that be go to deliver an address on foreign policy or on the economy be not go to talk about either but by the same token will try not to belabor with some of the standard rhetoric that be beloved of graduation speaker for example be not go to tell that know more today that have ever know before or that will ever know again the other standby be when be do not think father know anything by the time be be amazed at how much the old gentleman have learn in 7|year and then of course the traditional and the standby be that a university like this be a storehouse of knowledge because the freshman bring so much in and the senior take so little member of the graduate class of do not really go back that far be what behaviorist call achiever and while will look back with warm pleasure on memory of these|year that bring here to where be today be also know look at the future that seem uncertain to most of but which let assure offer great expectation take pride in this|day thank parent as on behalf have already do here thank those who have be of help to over the|last|4|years and do a little celebrating be entitle this be day and whatever say should take cognizance of that fact be a milestone in life and mark a time of change winston|churchill during the dark period of the battle|of|britain in world|war|ii say when great cause be on the move in the world learn be spirit not animal and that something be go on in space and time and beyond space and time which whether like or not spell duty now be go to mention again that movie that pat and and notre|dame be in because say something about america first knute|rockne as a boy come to america with parent from norway and in the|few|year take to grow up to college age become so american that here at notre|dame become an all american in a game that be still to this|day uniquely american as a coach do more than teach young man how to play a game believe truly that the noble work of man be build the character of man and maybe that be why be a living legend no man connect with football have ever achieve the stature or occupy the singular niche in the nation that carve out for not just in a sport but in entire social structure now today hear very often win for the gipper speak in a humorous vein lately have be hear by congressman who be supportive of the program that have introduce but let look at the significance of that story rockne could have use gipp 's die word to win a game any time but go by follow the death of george|gipp before rock reveal those die word deathbed wish and then tell the story at halftime to a team that be lose and of the only team have ever coach that be tear by dissension and jealousy and factionalism the senior on that team be about to close out football career without learn or experience any of the real value that a game have to impart none of have know george|gipp be child when play for notre|dame be to this team that rockne tell the story and so inspire that rise above personal animosity for someone have never know join together in a common cause and attain the unattainable be tell when be make the picture of line that be speak by a player during that game be actually afraid to put in the picture the man who carry the ball over for the win touchdown be injure on the play be tell that as be lift on the stretcher and carry off the field be hear to say that be the last one can get for gipper now be only a game and maybe to hear now afterward — and this be what fear may sound maudlin and not the way be intend but be there anything wrong with young people have an experience feel something so deeply think of someone else to the point that can give so completely of there will come time in the life of all of when will be face with cause big than and will not be on a playing field this nation be bear when a band of man the founding fathers a group so unique have never see like since rise to such selfless height lawyer tradesman merchant farmers—56 man achieve security and stand in life but value freedom more pledge life fortune and sacred honor of give life most give fortune all preserve sacred honor give more than a nation bring to all mankind for the first time the concept that man be bear free that each of have inalienable right our by the grace of god and that government be create by for convenience have only the power that choose to give this be the heritage that be about to claim as come out to join the society make up of those who have precede by a|few|year or some of by a great many this experiment in man 's relation to man be a|few|year into its|third|century say that may make sound quite old but let look at from another viewpoint or perspective a|few|years|ago someone figure out that if could condense the entire history of life on earth into a motion picture that would run for a day maybe on leap|years could have an intermission this idea that be the|united|state would not appear on the screen until 31/2|seconds|before|midnight|on|december|31st and in those not only would a new concept of society come into being a golden hope for all mankind but more|than|half the activity economic activity in world history would take place on this continent free to express genius individual americans man and woman in 3|1/2|seconds would perform such miracle of invention construction and production as the world have never see as join out there beyond the campus know there be great unsolved problem federalism with build in check and balance have be distort central government have usurped power that properly belong to local and state government and in so do in many way that central government have begin to fail to do the thing that be truly the responsibility of a central government all of this have lead to the misuse of power and preemption of the prerogative of people and social institution be graduate from a great private or if will independent university not too such school be relatively free from government interference in recent|years government have spawn regulation cover virtually every facet of life the independent and church support college and university have find enmesh in that network of regulation and the costly blizzard of paperwork that government be demand congressional committee and almost|80 subcommittee have jurisdiction over|439 separate law affect education at the college level alone almost every aspect of campus life be now regulate hire firing promotion physical plant construction record keeping fund raising and to some extent curriculum and educational program hope when leave this campus that will do so with a feeling of obligation to alma mater will need help and support in the|year to come if ever the great independent college and university like notre|dame give way to and be replace by tax support institution the struggle to preserve academic freedom will have be lose be trouble today by economic stagnation bring on by inflated currency and prohibitive taxis and burdensome regulation the cost of stagnation in human term mostly among those least equip to survive be cruel and inhuman now after those remark do not decide that would better turn diploma back in so can stay another year on the campus have just give the bad news the good news be that something be be do about all this because the people of america have say enough already know who have precede have just get so busy that let thing get out of hand forget that be the keeper of the power forget to challenge the notion that the state be the principal vehicle of social change forget that million of social interaction among free individual and institution can do more to foster economic and social progress than all the careful scheme of government planner well at last be remember remember that government have certain legitimate function which can perform very well that can be responsive to the people that can be humane and compassionate but that when undertake task that be not proper province can do none of as well or as economically as the private sector for too long government have be fix thing that be not break and invent miracle cure for unknown disease need need youth need strength need idealism to help make right that which be wrong now know that this period of life have be and be critically look at the more and custom of the past and question value every generation do that may suggest do not discard the time test value upon which civilization be build simply because be old more important do not let today 's doom crier and cynic persuade that the good be past that from here on be all downhill each generation see farther than the generation that precede because stand on the shoulder of that generation be go to have opportunity beyond anything that have ever know the people have make plain already want an end to excessive government intervention in life and in the economy an end to the burdensome and unnecessary regulation and a punitive tax policy that do take from the mouth of labor the bread have earn want a government that can not only continue to send man across the vast reach of space and bring safely home but that can guarantee that and can walk in the park of neighborhood after dark and get safely home and finally want to know that this nation have the ability to defend against those who would seek to pull down and all of this the people can do indeed a start have already be make there be a task force under the leadership of the vice president george|bush that be to look at those regulation have speak of have already identify hundred of that can be wipe out with no harm to the quality of life and the cancellation of just those regulation will leave billions|and|billions|of|dollar in the hand of the people for productive enterprise and research and development and the creation of job the|years|ahead be great one for this country for the cause of freedom and the spread of civilization the west will not contain communism will transcend communism will not bother to dismiss or denounce will dismiss as some bizarre chapter in human history whose last page be even now be write william|faulkner at a nobel|prize ceremony some time back say man would not only merely endure will prevail against the modern world because will return to the old verity and truth of the heart and then faulkner say of man be immortal because alone among creature have a soul a spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance one can not say those word compassion sacrifice and endurance without thinking of the irony that one who so exemplify pope john|paul|ii a man of peace and goodness an inspiration to the world would be strike by a bullet from a man towards whom could only feel compassion and love be pope john|paul|ii who warn in last|year 's encyclical on mercy and justice against certain economic theory that use the rhetoric of class struggle to justify injustice say in the name of an alleged justice the neighbor be sometimes destroy kill deprive of liberty or strip of fundamental human right for the west for america the time have come to dare to show to the world that civilized idea tradition value be not like the ideology and war machine of totalitarian society just a facade of strength be time for the world to know intellectual and spiritual value be root in the source of all strength a belief in a supreme being and a law high than own when be write history of time will not dwell long on the hardship of the recent past but history will ask — and answer determine the fate of freedom for a|thousand|years — do a nation bear of hope lose hope do a people forge by courage find courage want do a generation steel by hard war and a harsh peace forsake honor at the moment of great climactic struggle for the human spirit if history ask such question also answer and the answer be to be find in the heritage leave by generation of americans before stand in silent witness to what the world will soon know and history someday record that in the third century the|american|nation come of age affirm leadership of free man and woman serve selflessly a vision of man with god government for people and humanity at peace a|few|years|ago an australian prime minister john|gorton say wonder if anybody ever think what the situation for the comparatively small nation in the world would be if there be not in existence the|united|state if there be not this giant country prepare to make so many sacrifice this be the noble and rich heritage root in great civil idea of the west and be yours hope today be that in the|year to come — and come shall — when be time to explain to another generation the meaning of the past and thereby hold out to promise of the future that will recall the truth and tradition of which have speak be these truth and tradition that define civilization and make up national heritage and now be yours to protect and pass on have more hope for when do speak to the next generation about these thing that will always be able to speak of an america that be strong and free to find in heart an unbounded pride in this much love country this once and future land this bright and hopeful nation whose generous spirit and great ideal the world still honor congratulations and god bless & nbsp view transcript transcript mr. speaker mr. president distinguish member of the congress honor guest and fellow citizen have no word to express appreciation for that greeting have come to speak to tonight about economic recovery program and why believe be essential that the congress approve this package which believe will lift the crush burden of inflation off of citizen and restore the vitality to economy and industrial machine first however and due to event of the|past|few|week will permit to digress for a moment from the all important subject of why must bring government spending under control and reduce tax rate would like to say a few word directly to all of and to those who be watch and listen tonight because this be the only way know to express to all of on behalf of nancy and appreciation for message and flower and most of all prayer not only for but for those other who fall beside the warmth of word the expression of friendship and yes love mean more to than can ever know have give a memory that will treasure forever and have provide an answer to those few voice that be raise say that what happen be evidence that ours be a sick society the society hear from be make up of million of compassionate americans and child from college age to kindergarten as a matter of fact as evidence of that have a letter with the letter come from peter|sweeney be in the second grade in the|riverside|school in rockville|centre and say hope get well quick or may have to make a speech in pajama laughter add a postscript p.s. if have to make a speech in pajama warn laughter well sick society do not produce man like the who recently return from outer space sick society do not produce young man like secret|service agent tim|mccarthy who place body between mine and the man with the gun simply because feel that be what duty call for to do sick society do not produce dedicated police officer like or able and devoted public servant like jim|brady sick society do not make people like so proud to be americans and so very proud of fellow citizen now let talk about get spending and inflation under control and cut tax rate mr. speaker and senator baker want to thank for cooperation in help to arrange this joint session of the congress will not be speak to very long tonight but ask for this meeting because the urgency of joint mission have not change thank to some very fine people health be much improve would like to be able to say that with regard to the health of the economy be be since the election that charge all of in this government with the task of restore economy where have come in this|6|month inflation as measure by the consumer price index have continue at a double digit rate mortgage interest rate have average almost|15|percent for these|6|month prevent family across america from buy home there be still almost|8|million unemployed the average worker 's hourly earning after adjust for inflation be low today than be and there have be over|6,000 business failure month be long enough the american people now want to act and not in half measure demand and have earn a full and comprehensive effort to clean up economic mess because of the extent of economy 's sickness know that the cure will not come quickly and that even with package progress will come in inch and foot not in mile but to fail to act will delay even longer and more painfully the cure which must come and that cure begin with the federal budget and the budgetary action take by the congress over the|next|few|day will determine how respond to the message of last|november|4th that message be very simple government be too big and spend too much for the|last|few|month and have enjoy a relationship base on extraordinary cooperation because of this cooperation have come a long distance in less|than|3|months want to thank the leadership of the congress for help in set a fair timetable for consideration of recommendation and committee chairman on both side of the aisle have call prompt and thorough hearing have also communicate in a spirit of candor openness and mutual respect tonight as decision day near and as the|house|of|representatives weigh alternative wish to address in that same spirit the|senate|budget|committee under the leadership of pete|domenici have just today vote out a budget resolution support by democrats and republicans alike that be in all major respect consistent with the program that have propose now look forward to favorable action on the senate floor but an equally crucial test involve the|house|of|representatives the house will soon be choose between different version or measure to deal with the economy be the measure offer by the|house|budget|committee the other be a bipartisan measure a substitute introduce by congressmen phil|gramm of texas and of ohio on behalf of the administration let say that embrace and fully support that bipartisan substitute will achieve all the essential aim of control government spending reduce the tax burden build a national defense second to none and stimulate economic growth and create million of new job at the same time however must state opposition to the measure offer by the|house|budget|committee may appear that have alternative in reality however there be no more alternative leave the committee measure quite simply fall far too short of the essential action that must take for example in the|next|3|years the committee measure project spend more than do the bipartisan substitute regrettably cut over in essential defense spending funding require to restore america 's national security adhere to the fail policy of try to balance the budget on the taxpayer 's back would increase tax payment by over a third add up to a staggering quarter of a|trillion|dollars federal taxis would increase each|year taxpayer would be pay a large share of income to government in than do at present in short that measure reflect an echo of the past rather than a benchmark for the future high taxis and excess spending growth create present economic mess more of the same will not cure the hardship anxiety and discouragement have impose on the american people let cut through the fog for a moment the answer to a government that be too big be to stop feed growth government spending have be grow faster than the economy the massive national debt which accumulate be the result of the government 's high spending diet well be time to change the diet and to change in the right way know the tax portion of package be of concern to some of let make a few point that feel have be overlook first of all should be look at as an integral part of the entire package not something separate and apart from the budget reduction the regulatory relief and the monetary restraint probably the most common misconception be that be propose to reduce government revenue to less than what the government have be receive this be not true actually the discussion have to do with how much of a tax increase should be impose on the taxpayer in now know that over the recess in some informal polling some of constituent have be ask which would rather have a balanced budget or a tax cut and with the common sense that characterize the people of this country the answer of course have be a balanced budget but may suggest with no inference that there be wrong intent on the part of those who ask the question the question be inappropriate to the situation choice be not between a balanced budget and a tax cut properly ask the question be do want a great big raise in taxis this|coming|year|or at the bad a very little increase with the prospect of tax reduction and a balanced

mr. president will policy toward iran be of revenge or reconciliation and will honor the recent commitment to iran especially since approve of most of during the campaign the president well be certainly not think of revenge and do not know whether reconciliation would be possible with the present government or absence of a government in iran think that the|united|states will honor the obligation as a matter of fact the most important of those be already put into effect by the precede administration in negotiate the release be however study because there be major agreement and there be executive order and be study thoroughly what be a pretty complex matter have discover with regard to whether be in keep with international and own national law and so will not be able to really answer question on specific until have complete that study q mr. president the treasury secretary say monday that budget cut will be of a much high magnitude than most people think would be say would be across the board now that have have some time to study the budget can say where these cut will be make what program will feel the cut the most the president will be make every place maybe across the board be the wrong decision although describe what mean be that no one be exempt from be look at for area in which can make cut in spending and yes probably be go to be big than anyone have ever attempt because this administration do not come here to be a caretaker government and just hope could go along the same way and maybe do a little well think the time have come where there have to be a change of direction of this country and be go to begin with reduce government spending q mr. president in welcome address to the freed americans sound a warning of swift and effective retribution in future terrorist situation what kind of action be prepared to take to back up this hard rhetoric the president well that be a question that do not think can or should answer as to specific this be a big and be a powerful nation have a lot of option open to and to try and specify now just particularly what should do think be of the thing that be be wrong people have go to bed in some of these country that have do these thing to in the past confident that can go to sleep wake up in the|morning and the|united|state would not have take any action what mean by that phrase be that anyone who do these thing violate right in the future be not go to be able to go to bed with that confidence walt walter|rodger associated|press radio]. q mr. president campaign rather vociferously against the salt ii treaty say be slightly toward the|soviet|union yet notice secretary of state mr. haig now seem to suggest that for the time be at least the|united|states will abide by the limit of the|salt|ii treaty and hope the|soviet|union will too how long do intend that the|united|states should abide by the term of a salt agreement which consider inequitable and what do consider great inequity to be the president well the salt treaty first of all think permit a continue buildup on both side of strategic nuclear weapon but in the main thing authorize an immediate increase in large number of soviet warhead there be no verification as to the number of warhead on the missile no method for to do this do not think that a treaty salt mean strategic arm limitation that actually permit a buildup on both side of strategic nuclear weapon can properly be call that and have say that when can and be willing for people to go in to negotiate or let say discussion lead to negotiation that should start negotiate on the basis of try to effect an actual reduction in the number of nuclear weapon that would then be real strategic arm limitation and happen to believe also that can not sit down at a table and just negotiate that unless take into account in consideration at that table all the other thing that be go on in other word believe in linkage sam sam|donaldson q mr. president what do see as the long range intention of the|soviet|union do think for instance the kremlin be bent on world domination that may lead to a continuation of the cold war or do think that under other circumstance detente be possible the president well so far detente be be a way street that the|soviet|union have use to pursue own aim do not have to think of an answer as to what think intention be have repeat know of no leader of the|soviet|union since the revolution and include the present leadership that have not more than once repeat in the various communist congress hold determination that goal must be the promotion of world revolution and a world socialist or communist state whichever word want to use now as long as do that and as long as at the same time have openly and publicly declare that the only morality recognize be what will further cause mean reserve unto the right to commit any crime to lie to cheat in order to attain that and that be moral not immoral and operate on a different set of standard think when do business with even at a detente keep that in mind q mr. president what be opinion of american company that now want to resume business with iran the president opinion of american company that want to resume business with iran hope be go to do by long distance laughter would not want to go back to have just a different cast of character but the same show go on laughter can understand that particularly in the field of energy want to do that but be urge the people to think long and hard before travel to iran because do not think safety can be guarantee there q mr. president americans be still incarcerate in vietnam iran]. can tell the status of case and whether the administration be do anything to get back the president have tell people about those know about of course but have tell that yes continue and want to get back also now know have be stay down front here too much have get to prove can look at the back row there sir q okay mr. president some administrative official have promise adherence to the civil right law which be on the book but there have be considerable discussion about dismantle the affirmative action aspect that give those law to some people great meaning and be wonder mr. president that if there will be a retreat in the|federal|government on the government 's advocacy of affirmative action program generally and in federal hiring of black and hispanics specifically the president no there will be no retreat this administration be go to be dedicate to equality think have make great progress in the civil right field think there be some thing however that may not be as useful as once be or that may even be distort in the practice such as some affirmative action program become quota system and be old enough to remember when quota exist in the|united|state for the purpose of discrimination and do not want to see that happen again q mr. president when and how will seek the decontrol of natural gas prices?&nbsp the president well have not deal with that problem yet think oil would do for a starter but can not really answer question that will be a matter for discussion in future cabinet meeting lou lou|cannon washington post]. q mr. president during the campaign repeatedly talk about the unfairness of the grain embargo as see do have second thought now or will lift the grain embargo the president well with the grain embargo quarrel with from the first be that think be ask only|one group of americans to participate the farmer only have choice with an embargo either lift or broaden and have not make a decision except that at the request of secretary of agriculture john|block have take the matter of the embargo out of may say the discussion of the|national|security|council and next|week be on the agenda for a full cabinet meeting as to what course will be so can not answer what do about until next|week as say be ask group of americans to bear the burden and have always think be more of a kind of gesture than be something real yes madam q mr. president what will do to honor the request from atlanta official for and the|federal|government to intercede in the atlanta case of miss black child the president just|a|few|minute before come in here that message be hand to that the atlanta mayor want to talk and be go to get someone in touch with immediately now recognize of course that possibly civil right would be the only basis upon which could have any jurisdiction down there in this for fbi for example on any other thing there be be no evidence of cross state line or anything and yet want to be helpful because that be a most tragic case and so will be meet on that very shortly.&nbsp q mr. president when the jamaican prime minister be here yesterday mr. seaga suggest publicly that now may be a good time for as the new president to have a foreign policy initiative for latin|america and for the caribbean do intend to follow that suggestion and if so how would policy differ from those of former president carter the president well think have see a great reverse in the caribbean situation and come about through prime minister seaga 's election be the turnover or turn around of a nation that have go certainly in the direction of the communist movement be a protege of castro and election be greet by with great enthusiasm because represent the people by vote have experience that kind of government turn another direction and think this open the door for to have a policy in the mediterranean of bring back in those country that may have start in that direction or keep in the|western|world in the free world and so be look forward to cooperation with prime minister seaga q mr. president think mean caribbean in that last answer rather than mediterranean the president what 'd say q mediterranean the president oh mean caribbean be sorry q what do intend to do mr. president about the draft registration law that be pass during president carter 's administration and in view of opposition to in the campaign how be that consistent with avowed intention to strengthen national defense the president well to answer the last part first just do not feel that the advance registration on all the evidence could get would materially speed up the process if an emergency require the draft do create a bureaucracy cause certainly some unrest and dissatisfaction and be tell that would only be a matter of several|day if have to call up in a draft that could do that several|days|earlier with the registration than would be able if there be no registration at all this be one that be something to be look at further down have only be here and most of these|9|day have be spend in cabinet meeting on the economy get ready to send package up to the hill and so just have to tell that will be deal with that meet with that and make a decision on what to do with down the road someplace gary gary|schuster detroit news]. q mr. president speak of economic package can give thought on an effective date for the tax cut that plan to recommend in economic recovery plan and specify whether prefer effective date for business and another for personal cut or whether would like to combine the president would like to see all go forward all at once as to date know there be be talk about whether should be retroactive back or whether should be as of that|minute that to be not as important as get for individual the principle of a 10-percent cut for each of 3|year in place and the business taxis also so that can all look forward with some confidence of stability in the program and be go to strive for that and can not really answer about what the date will be until submit the package q mr. president know say earlier that be not think of revenge toward iran but do that preclude any punishment whatsoever for what have do the president well again have to ask forbearance and wait until have finish study of this whole situation as to what be go to do do not think any of have a friendly feeling toward the people that have do what have do but think be too complex for to answer until have have time to really study this q mr. president just follow up would go so far as to encourage american business to resume commercial trade with iran the president at this point no q mr. president do intend to follow through with campaign pledge to abolish the|departments|of|energy|and|education the president have not retreat from that at all yes the process however that have ask for be for both secretary bell|of|education and secretary jim|edwards of energy to reorganize to produce the most effective streamlining of department that can — in education to look at the appropriate role of the|federal|government in education if there be and to report back and then will decide make recommendation much the same thing hold true with the|department|of|energy the reason for this be that while be new cabinet level agency incorporate government function and program that have be go on in and come under that umbrella and have to find out which of those function that have be a federal|government function continue and where would best fit but yes be determined and believe that be wrong to have create the agency to begin with q mr. president during the campaign chief farm spokesman put on record as favoring for the time being continuation of the dairy price support level where have be within the|last|couple|of|day budget director and secretary of agriculture have indicate that the dairy program be too expensive and should be cut back could reconcile those difference of approach for the president well could only tell that this again be something to wait for the next cabinet meeting all of these thing be work out between the appropriate cabinet member and director of omb and then come to the cabinet for full discussion so that other who have an interest in this can have input and so can not answer because that have not yet come to the cabinet q mr. president iran and the|soviet|union share a long border in a region vital to the future stability of the world give the anti - u.s. sentiment there how do best think the|united|state can ensure the stability of the region the|persian|gulf|region the president of the — say iran the border between iran and the|soviet|union well think of the first thing that have to happen for stability have get to be in iran to establish a government that can speak as a government for iran and part of problem in all these long have be the inability of anyone seemingly to speak for that nation to have a government now think that any country would want to help another if really show an intent to have a government that would abide by international law and do what could to help in that regard but until such a thing appear apparent there do not know that there be anything can do q mr. president if be intention to signal the world that this country will respond with swift retribution in case of international terrorism in the future why be policy not to retaliate against iran the president well what good would just revenge do and what form would that take do not think revenge be worthy of on the other hand do not think act as if this never happen and would rather wait until as say complete this study who say know have be on this side too long but someone say por favor laughter q mr. president still be impress when listen the|other|day la roja blanca azul mr. president be true that when hispanics be give the opportunity to serve this country serve the country with diligence and dispatch in view of this undisputed fact when be go to appoint hispanic|american to serve in administration in policy make position the president be definitely recruit and definitely try to do that want an administration that will be representative of the country as a whole and please do not judge on the fact that have only pick a there will be position to fill in the executive branch and the|white|house senior staff and staff and the personnel committee in administration that be talent hunt and look for these people contain member of the minority hispanics and even a majority of woman and want that very much so do not judge now by the tip of the iceberg wait till be all in q. mr. president yes thank mr. president paul|volcker the chairman of the|federal|reserve|board have be implement policy that be exactly opposite in basic thrust from what recommend have be squeeze the productive sector of the economy in favor of the speculative sector now mean frankly mr. president there be important section of the american economy that be about to go under and will not even have an opportunity to benefit from the program that be put forward because of the federal|reserve policy q have a part question first of all do think that objective economic condition justify the interest rate level that now have and do not mean for answer to imply criticism of the fed be just an objective question and the second question be be concerned that there may be a sabotage so to speak of policy by program that the|federal|reserve may be put forward the president no be not concerned that there would be sabotage have meet with mr. volcker and not with the intention of try to dictate because be an independent agency and respect that but think that have to face the fact that interest rate be not in a cause of inflation be a consequence and when have as have have double digit inflation back to back for 2|solid|year now — the last time that happen be in world|war and when have double digit inflation there that way there be no question that interest rate be go to have to go up and follow that inflation rate and so the answer to the interest rate be go to be program of reduce government spending tie to the reduction of the tax rate that have speak of to bring down inflation and will find that interest rate come down do want from the fed and would ask for a moderate policy of money supply increase relative to legitimate growth all of these thing have to work together but do not think that the fed just deliberately raise interest rate the reason that have get to tie taxis and have to tie spend together be for all these decade have talk and have talk about solve these problem and have act as if the be separate so one|year fight inflation and then unemployment go up and then the|next|year fight unemployment and inflation go up be time to keep the together where belong and that be what be go to do yes sir q mr. president a number of conservative leader among some of staunch and most durable supporter such as senator jesse|helms be very concerned about some of appointment the basis of the concern be that many people who have be longtime reaganites and supporter of your do not seem to be able to get job like who play a key role on defense transition team whereas other individual who have not support throughout the year or philosophy like mr. terrel|bell the secretary of education who be for the establishment of the department which have say be go to abolish when mr. frank|carlucci deputy secretary of defense who be not a supporter of that have get job question be why be these individual in administration why be not mr. van|cleave and how much of a problem do think this conservative dissatisfaction with appointment be the president the only problem that have have that be more difficult than know which hand raise to point to here — and believe bother go home feel guilty for all the hand that could not point to laughter the only problem great have have be in the selection of personnel now in many instance some of the people that have be mention whose name that have be mention by other do not want a position in the administration help work very hard and want nothing for but also have to recognize there be not that many position after all look how many vote have can not reward all ms. thomas thank mr. president

without the support and consent of the people express formally through the congress and informally in many way through a whole range of public and private institution this be as should be within system of government every american have a right and a duty to help shape the future course of the|united|state thoughtful criticism and close scrutiny of all government official by the press and the public be an important part of democratic society now as in the past only the understanding and involvement of the people through full and open debate can help to avoid serious mistake and assure the continued dignity and safety of the nation today be ask political system to do thing of which the founding fathers never dream the government design for people now serve a nation of almost|230|million people small coastal republic now span beyond a continent and also now have the responsibility to help lead much of the world through difficult time to a secure and prosperous future today as people have become ever more doubtful of the ability of the government to deal with problem be increasingly draw to single issue group and special interest organization to ensure that whatever else happen own personal view and own private interest be protect this be a disturbing factor in american political life tend to distort purpose because the national interest be not always the sum of all single or special interest be all americans together and must not forget that the common good be common interest and individual responsibility because of the fragmented pressure of these special interest be very important that the office of the president be a strong one and that constitutional authority be preserve the president be the only elect official charge with the primary responsibility of represent all the people in the moment of decision after the different and conflicting view have all be air be the president who then must speak to the nation and for the nation understand after in this office as few other can how formidable be the task the new president elect be about to undertake and to the very limit of conscience and conviction pledge to support in that task wish success and godspeed know from experience that president have to face major issue that be controversial broad in scope and which do not arouse the natural support of a political majority for a|few|minute now want to lay aside role as leader of nation and speak to as a fellow citizen of the world about|three issue difficult issue the threat of nuclear destruction stewardship of the physical resource of planet and the preeminence of the basic right of human being be now be since the first atomic bomb fall on hiroshima the great majority of the world 's people can not remember a time when the .nuclear shadow do not hang over the earth mind have adjust to as after a time eye adjust to the dark yet the risk of a nuclear conflagration have not lessen have not happen yet thank god but that can give little comfort for only have to happen once the danger be become great as the arsenal of the superpower grow in size and sophistication and as other government perhaps even in the future dozen of government acquire these weapon may only be a matter of time before madness desperation greed or miscalculation let loose this terrible force in an all out nuclear war more destructive power than in all of world|war|ii would be unleashed every second during the long afternoon would take for all the missile and bomb to fall a world|war|ii every second more people kill in the|first|few|hour than in all the war of history put together the survivor if any would live in despair amid the poison ruin of a civilization that have commit suicide national weakness real or perceive can tempt aggression and thus cause war that be why the|united|state can never neglect military strength must and will remain strong but with equal determination the|united|state and all country must find way to control and to reduce the horrify danger that be pose by the enormous world stockpile of nuclear arm this have be a concern of every american president since the moment first see what these weapon could do leader will require understanding and support as grapple with this difficult but crucial challenge there be no disagreement on the goal or the basic approach to control this enormous destructive force the answer lie not just in the attitude or the action of world leader but in the concern and the demand of all of as continue struggle to preserve the peace nuclear weapon be an expression of side of human character but there be another side the same rocket technology that deliver nuclear warhead have also take peacefully into space from that perspective see earth as really be a small and fragile and beautiful blue globe the only home have see no barrier of race or religion or country see the essential unity of specie and planet and with faith and common sense that bright vision will ultimately prevail another major challenge therefore be to protect the quality of this world within which live the shadow that fall across the future be cast not only by the kind of weapon have build but by the kind of world will either nourish or neglect there be real and grow danger to simple and most precious possession the air breathe the water drink and the land which sustain the rapid depletion of irreplaceable mineral the erosion of topsoil the destruction of beauty the blight of pollution the demand of increase billion of people all combine to create problem which be easy to observe and predict but difficult to resolve if do not act the world of the|year|2000 will be much less able to sustain life than be now but there be no reason for despair acknowledge the physical reality of planet do not mean a dismal future of endless sacrifice in fact acknowledge these reality be the first step in deal with can meet the resource problem of the world water food mineral farmland forest overpopulation pollution if tackle with courage and foresight have just be talk about force of potential destruction that mankind have develop and how may control be equally important that remember the beneficial force that have evolve over the age and how to hold fast to of those constructive force be the enhancement of individual human freedom through the strengthening of democracy and the fight against deprivation torture terrorism and the persecution of people throughout the world the struggle for human right override all difference of color or nation or language
