transcript good morning for year america 's automaker have face serious challenge burdensome cost a shrink share of the market and decline profit in recent|months the global financial crisis have make these challenge even more severe now some u.s. auto executive say that company be near collapse and that the only way can buy time to restructure be with help from the federal government this be a difficult situation that involve fundamental question about the proper role of government on the hand government have a responsibility not to undermine the private enterprise system on the other hand government have a responsibility to safeguard the broad health and stability of economy address the challenge in the auto industry require to balance these responsibility if be to allow the free market to take course now would almost certainly lead to disorderly bankruptcy and liquidation for the automaker under ordinary economic circumstance would say this be the price that fail company must pay and would not favor intervene to prevent the automaker from go out of business but these be not ordinary circumstance in the midst of a financial crisis and a recession allow the u.s. auto industry to collapse be not a responsible course of action the question be how can best give a chance to succeed some argue the wise path be to allow the auto company to reorganize through chapter|11 provision of bankruptcy law and provide federal loan to keep operate while try to restructure under the supervision of a bankruptcy court but give the current state of the auto industry and the economy chapter|11 be unlikely to work for american automaker at this time american consumer understand why if hear that a car company be suddenly go into bankruptcy worry that part and servicing will not be available and question the value of warranty and with consumer hesitant to buy new car from struggle automaker would be more difficult for auto company to recover additionally the financial crisis bring the auto company to the brink of bankruptcy much faster than could have anticipate and have not make the legal and financial preparation necessary to carry out an orderly bankruptcy proceeding that could lead to a successful restructuring the convergence of these factor mean there be too great a risk that bankruptcy now would lead to a disorderly liquidation of american auto company economic advisor believe that such a collapse would deal an unacceptably painful blow to hardworke americans far beyond the auto industry would worsen a weak job market and exacerbate the financial crisis could send suffer economy into a deep and long recession and would leave the next president to confront the demise of a major american industry in his|first|days of office a more responsible option be to give the auto company an incentive to restructure outside of bankruptcy and a brief window in which to do and that be why administration work with congress on a bill to provide automaker with loan to stave off bankruptcy while develop plan for viability this legislation earn bipartisan support from majority in both house of congress unfortunately despite extensive debate and agreement that should prevent disorderly bankruptcy in the american auto industry congress be unable to get a bill to desk before adjourn this|year this mean the only way to avoid a collapse of the u.s. auto industry be for the executive branch to step in the american people want the auto company to succeed and so do i.|so today be announce that the federal government will grant loan to auto company under condition similar to those congress consider last|week these loan will provide help in way first will give automaker three|months to put in place plan to restructure into viable company which believe be capable of do second if restructuring can not be accomplish outside of bankruptcy the loan will provide time for company to make the legal and financial preparation necessary for an orderly chapter|11 process that offer a well prospect of long term success and give consumer confidence that can continue to buy american car because congress fail to make fund available for these loan the plan be announce today will be draw from the financial rescue package congress approve earlier|this|fall the term of the loan will require auto company to demonstrate how would become viable must pay back all loan to the government and show that firm can earn a profit and achieve a positive net worth this restructuring will require meaningful concession from all involve in the auto industry management labor union creditor bondholder dealer and supplier in particular automaker must meet condition that expert agree be necessary for long term viability include put retirement plan on a sustainable footing persuade bondholder to convert debt into capital the company need to address immediate financial shortfall and make compensation competitive with foreign automaker who have major operation in the|united|state if a company fail to come up with a viable plan by march|31st will be require to repay federal loan the automaker and union must understand what be at stake and make hard decision necessary to reform these condition send a clear message to everyone involve in the future of american automaker the time to make the hard decision to become viable be now or the only option will be bankruptcy the action be announce today represent a step that wish be not necessary but give the situation be the most effective and responsible way to address this challenge face nation by give the auto company a chance to restructure will shield the american people from a harsh economic blow at a vulnerable time and will give american worker an opportunity to

take to implement these principle will direct finance minister to work with other expert and report back to with detailed recommendation on further reasonable action vital principle of reform be that nation must make financial market more transparent for example should consider improve accounting rule for security so that investor around the world can understand the true value of the asset purchase secondly must ensure that market firm and financial product be properly regulate for example credit default swap financial product that insure against potential loss should be process through centralized clearinghouse instead of through unregulated over the counter market by bring great stability to this large and important financial sector reduce the risk to overall financial system third must enhance the integrity of financial market for example authority in every nation should take a fresh look at the rule govern market manipulation and fraud and ensure that investor be properly protect fourth must strengthen cooperation among the world 's financial authority for example lead nation should better coordinate national law and regulation should also reform international financial institution such as the imf and the|world|bank which be base largely on the economic order of to better reflect the reality of today 's global economy both the imf and world|bank should modernize governance structure should consider extend great voter vote power to dynamic develop nation especially as increase contribution to these institution should consider way to streamline executive board and make more representative in addition to these important to these management change should move forward with other reform to make the imf and world|bank more transparent accountable and effective for example the imf should agree to work more closely with member country to ensure that exchange rate policy be market orient and fair and the|world|bank should ensure development program reflect the priority of the people be design to serve and focus on measurable result all these step require decisive action from government around the world at the same time must recognize that government intervention be not a cure all for example some blame the crisis on insufficient regulation of the american mortgage market but many european country have much more extensive regulation and still experienced problem almost identical to own history have show that the great threat to economic prosperity be not too little government involvement in the market be too much government involvement in the market applause see this in the case of fannie|mae and freddie|mac because these firm be charter by the|united|states|congress many believe be back by the full faith and credit of the united|states government investor put huge amount of money into fannie|and|freddie which use to build up irresponsibly large portfolio of mortgage back security and when the housing market decline these security of course plummet in value take a taxpayer fund rescue to keep fannie and freddie from collapse in a way that would have devastate the global financial system and there be a clear lesson aim should not be more government should be smart government all this lead to the most important principle that should guide work while reform in the financial sector be essential the long term solution to today 's problem be sustain economic growth and the sure path to that growth be free market and free people applause this be a decisive moment for the global economy in the wake of the financial crisis voice from the left and right be equate the free enterprise system with greed and exploitation and failure be true this crisis include failure by lender and borrower and

make the reform need and move forward with the free market principle that have deliver prosperity and hope to people all across the globe like any other system design by man capitalism be not perfect

in car the record be unmistakable if seek economic growth if seek opportunity if seek social justice and human dignity the free market system be the way to go applause and would be a terrible mistake

pay the mortgage whether can put a little extra money away at so can someday watch child receive college diploma measure progress in the new job that be create when bill|clinton be president — when the average american family see income go up instead of down like have under george|bush measure the strength of economy not by the number of billionaire have or the profit of the fortune but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business or whether the waitress who live on tip can take a day off to look after a sick kid without lose job an economy that honor the dignity of work the fundamental use to measure economic strength be whether be live up to that fundamental promise that have make this country great a promise that be the only reason be stand here tonight because in the face of those young veteran who come back from iraq and afghanistan see grandfather who sign up after pearl|harbor march in patton 's army and be reward by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the|gi|bill in the face of that young student who sleep just|three|hours before work the night shift think about mom who raise sister and on own while work and earn degree who once turn to food stamp but be still able to send to the good school in the country with the help of student loan and scholarship when listen to another worker tell that factory have shut down remember all those man and woman on the|south|side of chicago who stand by and fight for two|decades|ago after the local steel plant close and when hear a woman talk about the difficulty of start own business think about grandmother who work way up from the secretarial pool to middle management despite year of be pass over for promotion because be a woman be the one who teach about hard work be the one who put off buy a new car or a new dress for so that could have a well life pour everything have into and although can no longer travel know that be watch tonight and that tonight be night as well do not know what kind of live john|mccain think that celebrity lead but this have be these be hero be the story that shape and be on behalf that intend to win this election and keep promise alive as president of the|united|state what be that promise be a promise that say each of have the freedom to make of own life what will but that also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect be a promise that say the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth but that business should live up to responsibility to create american job look out for american worker and play by the rule of the road be a promise that say government can not solve all problem but what should do be that which can not do for — protect from harm and provide every child a decent education keep water clean and toy safe invest in new school and new road and new science and technology government should work for not against should help not hurt should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence but for every american who be willing to work that be the promise of america the idea that be responsible for but that also rise or fall as nation the fundamental belief that be brother 's keeper be sister 's keeper that be the promise need to keep that be the change need right now so let spell out exactly what that change would mean if be president change mean a tax code that do not reward the lobbyist who write but the american worker and small business who deserve unlike john|mccain will stop give tax break to corporation that ship job overseas and will start give to company that create good job right here in america will eliminate capital gain taxis for the small business and the start up that will create the high wage high tech job of tomorrow will cut taxis cut taxis for of all work family because in an economy like this the last thing should do be raise taxis on the middle class and for the sake of economy security and the future of planet will set a clear goal as president in ten|year will finally end dependence on oil from the|middle|east washington be be talk about oil addiction for the|last|thirty|years and john|mccain have be there for of in that time be say no to high fuel efficiency standard for car no to investment in renewable energy no to renewable fuel and today import triple the amount of oil as the|day that senator mccain take office now be the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling be a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close as president will tap natural gas reserve invest in clean coal technology and find way to safely harness nuclear power will help auto company re - tool so that the fuel efficient car of the future be build right here in america will make easy for the american people to afford these new car and will invest over in affordable renewable source of energy — wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuel an investment that will lead to new industry and five|million new job that pay well and can not ever be outsource america now be not the time for small plan now be the time to finally meet moral obligation to provide every child a world class education because will take nothing less to compete in the global economy michelle and be only here tonight because be give a chance at an education and will not settle for an america where some kid do not have that chance will invest in early childhood education will recruit an army of new teacher and pay high salary and give more support and in exchange will ask for high standard and more accountability and will keep promise to every young american if commit to serve community or country will make sure can afford a college education now be the time to finally keep the promise of affordable accessible health care for every single american if have health care plan will lower premium if do not will be able to get the same kind of coverage that member of congress give and as someone who watch mother argue with insurance company while lie in bed die of cancer will make certain those company stop discriminate against those who be sick and need care the most now be the time to help family with pay sick day and well family leave because nobody in america should have to choose between keep job and care for a sick child or ail parent now be the time to change bankruptcy law so that pension be protect ahead of ceo bonus and the time to protect social|security for future generation and now be the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an|equal|day 's work because want daughter to have exactly the same opportunity as son now many of these plan will cost money which be why have lay out how will pay for every dime by close corporate loophole and tax haven that do not help america grow but will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminate program that no longer work and make the one do need work better and cost less because can not meet first|century challenge with bureaucracy and democrats must also admit that fulfil america 's promise will require more than just money will require a renew sense of responsibility from each of to recover what john|f.|kennedy call intellectual and moral strength yes government must lead on energy independence but each of must do part to make home and business more efficient yes must provide more ladder to success for young man who fall into life of crime and despair but must also admit that program alone can not replace parent that government can not turn off the television and make a child do homework that father must take more responsibility for provide the love and guidance child need individual responsibility and mutual responsibility that be the essence of america 's promise and just as keep keep promise to the next generation here at home so must keep america 's promise abroad if john|mccain want to have a debate about who have the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief that be a debate be ready to have for while senator mccain be turn sight to iraq just day after stand up and oppose this war know that would distract from the real threat face when john|mccain say could just muddle through in afghanistan argue for more resource and more troop to finish the fight against the terrorist who actually attack on and make clear that must take out osama|bin|laden and lieutenant if have in sight john|mccain like to say that will follow bin|laden to the gates of hell but will not even go to the cave where live and today as call for a time frame to remove troop from iraq have be echo by the iraqi government and even the|bush|administration even after learn that iraq have a surplus while be wallow in deficit john|mccain stand alone in stubborn refusal to end a misguided war that be not the judgment need that will not keep america safe need a president who can face the threat of the future not keep grasp at the idea of the past do not defeat a terrorist network that operate in country by occupy iraq do not protect israel and deter iran just by talk tough in washington can not truly stand up for georgia when have strain old alliance if john|mccain want to follow george|bush with more tough talk and bad strategy that be choice but be not the change need be the party of roosevelt be the party of kennedy so do not tell that democrats will not defend this country do not tell that democrats will not keep safe the bush mccain foreign policy have squander the legacy that generation of americans democrats and republicans — have build and be here to restore that legacy as commander in chief will never hesitate to defend this nation but will only send troop into harm 's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give the equipment need in battle and the care and benefit deserve when come home will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al|qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan will rebuild military to meet future conflict but will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtain nuclear weapon and curb russian aggression will build new partnership to defeat the threat of the|21st|century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease and will restore moral standing so that america be once again that last good hope for all who be call to the cause of freedom who long for life of peace and who yearn for a well future these be the policy will pursue and in the|weeks|ahead look forward to debate with john|mccain but what will not do be suggest that the senator take position for political purpose because of the thing that have to change in politic be the idea that people can not disagree without challenge each other 's character and patriotism the time be too serious the stake be too high for this same partisan playbook so let agree that patriotism have no party love this country and so do and so do john|mccain the man and woman who serve in battlefield may be democrats and republicans and independents but have fight together and bleed together and some die together under the same proud flag have not serve a red|america or a blue america have serve the|united|states|of|america so have get news for john|mccain all put country first america work will not be easy the challenge face require tough choice and democrats as well as republicans will need to cast off the wear out idea and politic of the past for part of what have be lose these|past|eight|year can not just be measure by lose wage or big trade deficit what have also be lose be sense of common purpose sense of high purpose and that be what have to restore may not agree on abortion but surely can agree on reduce the number of unwanted pregnancy in this country the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunter in rural ohio than for those plague by gang violence in cleveland but do not tell can not uphold the|second|amendment while keep ak-47s out of the hand of criminal know there be difference on same sex marriage but surely can agree that gay and lesbian brother and sister deserve to visit the person love in the hospital and to live life free of discrimination passion fly on immigration but do not know anyone who benefit when a mother be separate from infant child or an employer undercut american wage by hire illegal worker this too be part of america 's promise the promise of a democracy where can find the strength and grace to bridge divide and unite in common effort know there be those who dismiss such belief as happy talk claim that insistence on something large something firm and more honest in public life be just a trojan horse for high taxis and the abandonment of traditional value and that be to be expect because if do not have any fresh idea then use stale tactic to scare the voter if do not have a record to run on then paint opponent as someone people should run from make a big election about small thing and know what — be work before because feed into the cynicism all have about government when washington do not work all promise seem empty if hope have be dash again and again then be good to stop hope and settle for what already know get realize that be not the likeli candidate for this office do not fit the typical pedigree and have not spend career in the hall of washington but stand before tonight because all across america something be stirring what the nay sayer do not understand be that this election have never be about be be about for eighteen|long|month have stand up by and say enough to the politic of the past understand that in this election the great risk can take be to try the same old politic with the same old player and expect a different result have show what history teach that at define moment like this one the change need do not come from washington change come to washington change happen because the american people demand because rise up and insist on new idea and new leadership a new politic for a new time america this be of those moment believe that as hard as will be the change need be come because have see because have live have see in illinois when provide health care to more child and move more family from welfare to work have see in washington when work across party line to open up government and hold lobbyist more accountable to give well care for veteran and keep nuclear weapon out of terrorist hand and have see in this campaign in the young people who vote for the first time and in those who get involve again after a very long time in the republicans who never think would pick up a democratic ballot but do have see in the worker who would rather cut hour back a day than see friend lose job in the soldier who re - enlist after lose a limb in the good neighbor who take a stranger in when a hurricane strike and the floodwater rise this country of our have more wealth than any nation but that be not what make rich have the most powerful military on earth but that be not what make strong university and culture be the envy of the world but that be not what keep the world come to shore instead be that american spirit that american promise that push forward even when the path be uncertain that bind together in spite of difference that make fix eye not on what be see but what be unseen that well place around the bend that promise be great inheritance be a promise make to daughter when tuck in at night and a promise that make to a promise that have lead immigrant to cross ocean and pioneer to travel west a promise that lead worker to picket line and woman to reach for the ballot and be that promise that forty|five|years|ago today bring americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington before lincoln 's memorial and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of dream the man and woman who gather there could have hear many thing could have hear word of anger and discord could have be tell to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dream defer but what the people hear instead people of every creed and color from every walk of life be that in america destiny be inextricably link that together dream can be can not walk alone the preacher cry and as walk must make the pledge that shall always march ahead can not turn back america can not turn back not with so much work to be do not with so many child to educate and so many veteran to care for not with an economy to fix and city to rebuild and farm to save not with so many family to protect and so many life to mend america can not turn back can not walk alone at this moment in this election must pledge once more to march into the future let keep

from which to plot new attack across the world the battle in iraq have be long and harder and more costly than anticipate but be a fight must win so troop have engage these enemy with courage and determination and as have battle the terrorist and extremist in iraq have help the iraqi people reclaim nation and help a young democracy rise from the rubble of saddam|hussein 's tyranny over the|past|5|years have see moment of triumph and moment of tragedy have watch in admiration as iraqis defy the terrorist and go to the poll and choose leader in free election watch in horror as behead innocent captive and send suicide bomber to blow up mosque and market these action show the brutal nature of the enemy in iraq and serve as a grim reminder the terrorist who murder the innocent in the street of baghdad want to murder the innocent in the street of america defeat this enemy in iraq will make less likely that will face the enemy here at home a|little|over|a|year|ago the fight in iraq be falter extremist element be succeed in effort to plunge iraq into chaos have establish safe haven in many part of the country be create division among the iraqis along sectarian line and strategy of use violence in iraq to cause division in america be work as pressure build here in washington for withdrawal before the job be do administration understand that america could not retreat in the face of terror and know that if do not act the violence that have be consume iraq would worsen and spread and could eventually reach genocidal level baghdad could have disintegrate into a contagion of killing and iraq could have descend into full blow sectarian warfare so review the strategy and change course in iraq send reinforcement into the country in a dramatic policy shift that be now know as the surge general david|petraeus take command with a new mission work with iraqi force to protect the iraqi people pressure the enemy into stronghold and deny the terrorist sanctuary anywhere in the country and that be precisely what have do in anbar sunni tribal leader have grow tired of al|qaida 's brutality and start a popular uprising call the|anbar|awakening to take advantage of this opportunity send additional marine to help these brave iraqis drive al|qaida from the province as this effort succeed inspire other iraqis to take up the fight soon similar uprising begin to spread across the country today there be more|than|90,000 concerned local citizen who be protect community from the terrorist and insurgent and the extremist the government in baghdad have step forward with a surge of own have add more|than|100,000 new iraqi soldier and police during the|past|year these iraqi troop have fight bravely and thousand have give life in this struggle together these americans and iraqi force have drive the terrorist from many of the sanctuary once hold now the terrorist have gather in and around the northern iraqi city of mosul and iraqi and american force be relentlessly pursue there will be tough fighting in mosul and area of northern iraq in the|weeks|ahead but there be no doubt in mind because of the courage of troop and the bravery of the iraqis the terrorist in this region will suffer the same fate as suffer elsewhere in iraq as have fight al|qaida coalition and iraqi force have also take the fight to shi'a extremist group many of back and finance and arm by iran a|year|ago these group be on the rise today be increasingly isolate and iraqis of all faith be put life on the line to stop these extremist from hijack young democracy to ensure that military progress in iraq be quickly follow up with real improvement in daily life have double the number of provincial|reconstruction|team in iraq these team of civilian expert be serve all iraqi—18 iraqi provinces and be help to strengthen responsible leader and build up local economy and bring iraqis together so that reconciliation can happen from the ground up be very effective be help give ordinary iraqis confidence that by reject the extremist and reconcile with another can claim place in a free iraq and build well life for family there be still hard work to be do in iraq the gain have make be fragile and reversible but on this anniversary the american people should know that since the surge begin the level of violence be significantly down civilian death be down sectarian killing be down attack on american force be down have capture or kill thousand of extremist in iraq include hundred of key leader and operative man and woman in uniform be perform with characteristic honor and valor the surge be work and as a return on success in iraq have begin bring some of troop home the surge have do more than turn the situation in iraq around have open the door to a major strategic victory in the broad war on terror for the terrorist iraq be suppose to be the place where rally arab masse to drive america out instead iraq have become the place where arabs join with americans to drive al|qaida out in iraq be witness the first large scale arab uprising against osama|bin|laden grim ideology and murderous network and the significance of this development can not be overstate the terrorist movement feed on a sense of inevitability and claim to rise on the tide of history the accomplishment of the surge in iraq be expose this myth and discredit the extremist when iraqi and american force finish the job the effect will reverberate far beyond iraq 's border usama bin|laden once say when people see a strong horse and a weak horse by nature will like the strong horse by defeat al|qaida in iraq will show the world that al|qaida be the weak horse will show that man and woman who love liberty can defeat the terrorist and will show that the future of the|middle|east do not belong to terror the future of the|middle|east belong to freedom the challenge in this period ahead be to consolidate the gain have make and seal the extremist ' defeat have learn through hard experience what happen when pull force back too fast the terrorist and extremist step in fill vacuum establish safe haven and use to spread chaos and carnage general petraeus have warn that too fast a drawdown could result in such an unraveling with al|qaida and insurgent and militia extremist regain lose ground and increase violence men and woman of the|armed|force have come so far and achieve so much be not go to let this to happen next|month general petraeus and ambassador crocker will come to washington to testify before congress will await recommendation before make decision on troop level in iraq any further drawdown will be base on condition on the ground and the recommendation of commander and must not jeopardize the hard fight gain troop and civilian have make over the|past|year success be see in iraq be undeniable yet some in washington still call for retreat war critic can no longer credibly argue that be lose in iraq so now argue the war cost too much in recent|months have hear exaggerated amount of the cost of this war no one be would argue that this war have not come at a high cost in life and treasure but those cost be necessary when consider the cost of a strategic victory for enemy in iraq if be to allow enemy to prevail in iraq the violence that be now decline would accelerate and iraq would descend into chaos al|qaida would regain lost sanctuary and establish new one foment violence and terror that could spread beyond iraq 's border with serious consequence for the world 's economy out of such chaos in iraq the terrorist movement could emerge embolden with new recruit new resource and an even great determination to dominate the region and harm america an emboldened with access to iraq 's oil resource could pursue ambition to acquire weapon of mass destruction to attack america and other free nation iran would be embolden as well with a renew determination to develop nuclear weapon and impose brand of hegemony across the|middle|east enemy would see an america an american failure in iraq as evidence of weakness and a lack of resolve to allow this to happen would be to ignore the lesson of september|the|11th and make more likely that america would suffer another attack like the one experience that|day a|day in which armed man with box cutter kill nearly|3,000 people in — on soil a|day after which in the following of that attack more|than|a|million americans lose work lose job the terrorist intend even great harm to country and have no great responsibility than to defeat enemy across the world so that can not carry out such an attack as coalition fight the enemy in iraq have stay on the offensive on other front in the war on terror know just a few week after commence operation|iraqi|freedom u.s. force capture khalid|sheikh|mohammed the mastermind behind the september|the|11th terrorist attack get in pakistan about the same time as launch operation|iraqi|freedom coalition force thousand of hundreds|of|mile away launch an assault on the terrorist in the mountain of southern afghanistan in an operation call operation|valiant|strike throughout the war on terror have bring the enemy have fight the enemy on every single battlefront and so long as terrorist danger remain the|united|states|of|america will continue to fight the enemy wherever make stand will stay on the offense but in the long run defeat the terrorist require an alternative to murderous ideology and there have another advantage have get a singular advantage with military when come to find the terrorist and bring to justice and have another advantage in strong belief in the transformative power of liberty so be help the people of iraq establish a democracy in the heart of the|middle|east a free iraq will fight terrorist instead of harbor a free iraq will be an example for other of the power of liberty to change the society and to displace despair with hope by spread the hope of liberty in the|middle|east will help free

remain charge to keep the action of the 110th congress will affect the security and prosperity of nation long after this session have end in this|election|year let show fellow americans that recognize responsibility and be determined to meet let show that republicans and democrats can compete for vote and cooperate for result at the same time from expand opportunity to protect country have make good progress yet have unfinished business before and the american people expect to get do in the work ahead must be guide by the philosophy that make nation great as americans believe in the power of

of free people to make wise decision and empower to improve life for future to build a prosperous future must trust people with own money and empower to grow economy as meet tonight economy be undergo a period of uncertainty america have add job for a record but job be now grow at a slow pace wage be up but so be price for food and gas export be rise but the housing market have decline at kitchen table across country there be a concern about economic future in the long run americans can be confident about economic growth but in the short run can all see that that growth be slow so last|week administration reach agreement with speaker pelosi and republican leader boehner on a robust growth package that include tax relief for individual and family and incentive for business investment the temptation will be to load up the bill that would delay or derail and neither option be acceptable this be a good agreement that will keep economy grow and people work and this congress must pass as

know better than anybody put pressure on the public school and the hospital not only here in border state but state around the country drain the state and local budget be talk to the governor about how strain the budget incarceration of criminal who be here illegally strain the arizona budget but there be a lot of other way strain the local and state budget bring crime to community be a problem and need to address aggressively this problem have be grow for decade and past effort to address have fail these failure help create a perception that america be not serious about enforce immigration law and that could be break without consequence past effort at reform do not do enough to secure nation 's border as a result many people have be able to sneak into this country if do not man border and do not protect border people be go to sneak in and that be what be be happen for a long time past effort at reform fail to address the underlie economic reason behind illegal immigration people will make great sacrifice to get into this country the find job and provide for family when be the governor of texas use to say family value do not stop at the|rio|grande|river people be come here to put food on the table and be do job americans be not do and the farmer in this part of the world understand exactly what be say but so do a lot of other folk around the country people be come to work and many of have no lawful way to come to america and so be sneak in past effort at reform also fail to provide sensible way for employer to verify the legal status of the worker hire be against the law to knowingly hire an illegal alien and as a result because could not verify the legal status be difficult for employer to comply be difficult for the government to enforce the law at the work site and yet be a necessary part of a comprehensive plan see the lesson of all these experience the lesson of these experience be clear all element of the issue must be address together can not address just aspect and not be able to say to the american people that be secure border need a comprehensive bill and that be what be work with member of congress on a comprehensive immigration bill and now be the|year to get do the first element of course be to secure this border that be what be down here for to remind the american people that be spend taxpayer money taxpayer ' money on secure the border and be make progress this border should be open to trade and lawful immigration and shut down to criminal and drug dealer and terrorist and coyote and smuggler people who prey on innocent life more than double the funding for border security since have be the president in other word be thing to hear people come down here and talk be another thing for people to come down and do what say be go to do and want to thank congress for work on this issue the funding be increase manpower the additional funding be increase infrastructure and be increase technology when land here at the airport the first thing see be an unmanned aerial vehicle be a sophisticated piece of equipment can fly from inside a truck and can look at people move at night be the most sophisticated technology have and be down here on the border to help the border|patrol agent do job have expand the number of border|patrol agent from about|9,000|to|13,000 and by the|end|of|2008 be go to have a total of more|than|18,000 agent have the privilege of go to artesia new|mexico to the training center be a fantastic experience to see the young cadet get ready to come and wear the green of the|border|patrol by the time be through will have double the size of the|border|patrol in other word can not do the job the american people expect unless get enough manpower and be increase the manpower down here this new technology be really important to basically leverage the manpower whether be the technology of surveillance and communication be go to make sure the agent have get what be necessary to be able to establish a common picture and get information out to the field as quickly as possible so that those agent when be finally on station can do the job the american people expect but manpower can not do alone in other word there have to be some infrastructure along the border to be able to let these agent do job and so appreciate the fact that have get double fencing all weather road new lighting mobile camera the american people have no earthly idea what be go on down here of the reason have come be to let know let the taxpayer know the good folk down here be make progress have work with nation 's governor to deploy national|guard member to provide the|border|patrol with immediate reinforcement in other word take time to train the|border|patrol and until be fully train have ask the guard to come down be call operation jump|start and the guard down here be serve nobly have the chance to visit with some of the guard and mr. mayor will be pleased to hear like be down here in yuma arizona like the people and like the mission more|than|600 member of the guard be serve here in the yuma sector and thank the guard and equally importantly thank family for stand by the man and woman who wear the uniform during this particular mission email back home and tell how much appreciate the fact be stand by appreciate very much the fact that illegal border crossing in this area be down in the|month before operation jump|start an average of people a day be apprehend try to cross here the number have drop to fewer|than|140 a day in other word way that the|border|patrol can tell whether or not be make progress be the number of apprehension when be apprehend few people mean few be try to come across and few be try to come across because be deter people from attempt illegal border crossing in the first place appreciate what colburn say put this way be watch see watch that be what say and have decide just can not get across and that be part of the effort be do be say be go to make harder for so do not try in the first place be see similar result all across the southern border the number of people apprehend for illegally cross southern border be down by nearly|30|percent this|year be make progress and thank for hard work be hard work but necessary work another important deterrent to illegal immigration be to end what be call catch and release know how this discourage some of border|patrol agent talk to personally work hard to find somebody sneak in the country apprehend the next thing know be back in society on side of the border there be nothing more discouraging than have somebody risk life or work hard and have the fruit of labor undermined and that be what be happen with catch and release in other word would catch people and would say show up for court date and would not show up for court date that should not surprise anybody but that be what be happen and the reason why that be happen be because do not have enough bed to detain people now most of the people apprehend down here be from mexico about|85|percent of the illegal immigrant catch cross into cross this border be mexicans cross the southern border be mexicans and be send home within be the illegal immigrant from other country that be not that easy to send home for many|years the government do not have enough space and so michael and work with congress to increase the number of bed available so that excuse be eliminate the practice have be effectively end catch and release for every non - mexican have be effectively end and want to thank the|border|patrol and the leader of the|border|patrol for allow to stand up and say that be the case the reason why be not only do have bed have expedite the legal process to cut the average deportation time now these be non - mexican illegal alien that have catch try to sneak into country be make clear to foreign government that must accept back citizen who violate immigration law say be go to effectively end catch and release and have and appreciate hard work in do that the second element of a comprehensive immigration reform be a temporary worker program can not fully secure the border until take pressure off the border and that require a temporary worker program seem to make sense to that if have get people come here to do job americans be not do need to figure out a way that can do so in a legal basis for a temporary period of time and that way border|patrol can chase the criminal and the drug runner potential terrorist and not have to try to chase people who be come here to do work americans be not do if want to take the pressure off border have a temporary worker program will help not only reduce the number of people come across the border but will do something about the inhumane treatment that these people be subject to there be a whole smuggling operation know this well than do there be a bunch of smuggler that use the individual as a piece of as a commodity and make money off these poor people and stuff in the back of 18-wheeler and find hovel for to hide in and there be a whole industry that have spring up and seem like to that since this country respect human right and the human condition that be a great contribution to eliminate this thuggery to free these people from this kind of extortion that go through and way to do so be to say can come and work in country for job americans be not do for a temporary period of time the third element of a comprehensive reform be to hold employer accountable for the worker hire in other word if want to make sure that have get a system in which people be not violate the law then have get to make sure hold people to account like employer enforce immigration be a vital part of any successful reform and so chertoff and department be crack down on employer who knowingly violate the law but not only be there coyote smuggle people in there be document forger that be make a living off these people so in other word people may want to comply with the law but be very difficult at time to verify the legal status of employee and so to make the work site enforcement practical on a large scale have get to issue a tamper proof identification card for legal foreign worker must create a well system for employer to verify the legality of the worker in other word get work to do and part of a comprehensive bill be to make sure work site enforcement be effective fourth have get to resolve the status of million of illegal immigrant already here in the country people who enter country illegally should not be give amnesty amnesty be the forgiveness of an offense without penalty oppose amnesty and think most people in the|united|states|congress oppose amnesty people say why not have amnesty well the reason why be because do not want to have a president have to address the next people who may be here illegally that be why do not want amnesty and secondly be a nation of law and expect people to uphold the law so be work closely with republicans and democrats to find a practical answer that lie between grant automatic citizenship to every illegal immigrant and deport every illegal immigrant be impractical to take the position that oh will just find the or people and send home be just an impractical position be not go to work may sound good may make nice sound bite news will not happen and therefore need to work together to come up with a practical solution to this problem and know people in congress be work hard on this issue illegal immigrant who have root in country and want to stay should have to pay a meaningful penalty for break the law and pay taxis and learn the english language and show work show that have work in a job for a number of year people who meet a reasonable number of condition and pay a penalty of

unified and democratic nation the election of be a stunning achievement think that these election would bring the iraqis together and that as train iraqi security force could accomplish mission with few american troop but in the opposite happen the violence in iraq particularly in baghdad overwhelm the political gain the iraqis have make al|qaeda terrorist and sunni insurgent recognize the mortal danger that iraq 's election pose for cause and respond with outrageous act of murder aim at innocent iraqis blow up of the holy shrine in shia|islam in a calculated effort to provoke iraq 's shia population to retaliate strategy work radical shia element some support by iran form death squad and the result be a vicious cycle of sectarian violence that continue today the situation in iraq be unacceptable to the american people and be unacceptable to troop in iraq have fight bravely have do everything have ask to do where mistake have be make the responsibility rest with be clear that need to change strategy in iraq so national security team military commander and diplomat conduct a comprehensive review consult member of congress from both party ally abroad and distinguish outside expert benefit from the thoughtful recommendation of the|iraq|study|group a bipartisan panel lead by former secretary of state james|baker and former congressman lee|hamilton in discussion all agree that there be no magic formula for success in iraq and message come through loud and clear failure in iraq would be a disaster for the|united|state the consequence of failure be clear radical islamic extremist would grow in strength and gain new recruit would be in a well position to topple moderate government create chaos in the region and use oil revenue to fund ambition iran would be embolden in pursuit of nuclear weapon enemy would have a safe haven from which to plan and launch attack on the american people on september|the|11th,|2001 see what a refuge for extremist on the other side of the world could bring to the street of own city for the safety of people america must succeed in iraq the most urgent priority for success in iraq be security especially in baghdad of iraq 's sectarian violence occur within of the capital this violence be split baghdad into sectarian enclave and shake the confidence of all iraqis only iraqis can end the sectarian violence and secure people and government have put forward an aggressive plan to do past effort to secure baghdad fail for principal reason there be not enough iraqi and american troop to secure neighborhood that have be clear of terrorist and insurgent and there be too many restriction on the troop do have military commander review the new iraqi plan to ensure that address these mistake report that do also report that this plan can work now let explain the main element of this effort the iraqi government will appoint a military commander and deputy commander for capital the iraqi government will deploy iraqi|army and national|police brigade across baghdad 's district when these force be fully deploy there will be iraqi|army and national|police brigade commit to this effort along with local police these iraqi force will operate from local police station conduct patrol and set up checkpoint and go door to door to gain the trust of baghdad resident this be a strong commitment but for to succeed commander say the iraqis will need help so america will change strategy to help the iraqis carry out campaign to put down sectarian violence and bring security to the people of baghdad this will require increase american force level so have commit more|than|20,000 additional american troop to iraq the vast majority of brigade will be deploy to baghdad these troop will work alongside iraqi unit and be embed in formation troop will have a well define mission to help iraqis clear and secure neighborhood to help protect the local population and to help ensure that the iraqi force leave behind be capable of provide the security that baghdad need many listening tonight will ask why this effort will succeed when previous operation to secure baghdad do not well here be the difference in early operation iraqi and american force clear many neighborhood of terrorist and insurgent but when force move on to other target the killer return this time will have the force level need to hold the area that have be clear in early operation political and sectarian interference prevent iraqi and american force from go into neighborhood that be home to those fuel the sectarian violence this time iraqi and american force will have a green light to enter those neighborhood and prime minister maliki have pledge that political or sectarian interference will not be tolerate have make clear to the prime minister and iraq 's other leader that america 's commitment be not open ended if the iraqi government do not follow through on promise will lose the support of the american people and will lose the support of the iraqi people now be the time to act the prime minister understand this here be what tell people just last|week the baghdad security plan will not provide a safe haven for any outlaw regardless of sectarian or political affiliation this new strategy will not yield an immediate end to suicide bombing assassination or ied attack enemy in iraq will make every effort to ensure that television screen be fill with image of death and suffering yet over time can expect to see iraqi troop chase down murderer few brazen act of terror and grow trust and cooperation from baghdad 's resident when this happen daily life will improve iraqis will gain confidence in leader and the government will have the breathing space need to make progress in other critical area most of iraq 's sunni and shia want to live together in peace and reduce the violence in baghdad will help make reconciliation possible a successful strategy for iraq go beyond military operation ordinary iraqi

conscience and will make the year ahead bloody and violent even if new strategy work exactly as plan deadly act of violence will continue and must expect more iraqi and american casualty the question be whether new strategy will bring closer to success believe that will victory will not look like the one father and grandfather achieve there will be no surrender ceremony on the deck of a battleship but victory in iraq will bring something new in the arab world a function democracy that police territory uphold the rule of law respect fundamental human liberty and answer to people a democratic iraq will not be perfect but will be a country that fight terrorist instead of harbor and will help bring a future of peace and security for child and grandchild this new approach come after consultation with congress about the different course could take in iraq many be concerned that the iraqis be become too dependent on the|united|state and therefore policy should focus on protect iraq 's border and hunt down al|qaeda solution be to scale back america 's effort in baghdad or announce the phase withdrawal of combat force carefully consider these proposal and conclude that to step back now would force a collapse of the iraqi government tear the country apart and result in mass killing on an unimaginable scale such a scenario would result in troop be force to stay in iraq even longer and confront an enemy that be even more lethal if increase support at this crucial moment and help the iraqis break the current cycle of violence can hasten the day troop begin come home in the|days|ahead national security team will fully brief congress on new strategy if member have improvement that can be make will make if circumstance change will adjust honorable people have different

redeem now america be engage in a new struggle that will set the course for a|new|century can and will prevail go forward with trust that the|author|of|liberty will guide through these|trying|hours thank and good night view transcript transcript good afternoon congress have just pass and send to desk bill concern the use of stem cell in biomedical research these bill illustrate both the promise and peril face in the age of biotechnology in this new era challenge be to harness the power of science to ease human suffering without sanction the practice that violate the dignity of human life applause in speak to the american people and set forth a new policy on stem cell research that strike a balance between the need of science and the demand of conscience when take office there be no federal funding for human embryonic stem cell research under the policy announce five|years|ago administration become the first to make federal fund available for this research yet only on embryonic stem cell line derive from embryo that have already be destroy administration have make available for research on these line this policy have allow important research to go forward without use taxpayer fund to encourage the further deliberate destruction of human embryo of the bill congress have pass build on the progress have make over the|last|five|year so sign into law applause congress have also pass a second bill that attempt to overturn the balanced policy set this bill would support the taking of innocent human life in the hope of find medical benefit for other cross a moral boundary that decent society need to respect so veto applause like all americans believe nation must vigorously pursue the tremendous possibility that science offer to cure disease and improve the life of million have opportunity to discover cure and treatment that be unthinkable generation ago some scientist believe that source of these cure may be embryonic stem cell research embryonic stem cell have the ability to grow into specialized adult tissue and this may give the potential to replace damaged or defective cell or body part and treat a variety of disease yet must also remember that embryonic stem cell come from human embryo that be destroy for cell each of these human embryo be a unique human life with inherent dignity and matchless value see that value in the child who be with today each of these child begin or life as a frozen embryo that be create for in fertilization but remain unused after the fertility treatment be complete each of these child be adopt while still an embryo and have be bless with the chance to grow up in a love family these boy and girl be not spare part applause remind of what be lose when embryo be destroy in the name of research remind that all begin life as a small collection of cell and remind that in zeal for new treatment and cure america must never abandon fundamental moral some people argue that find new cure for disease require the destruction of human embryo like the one that these family adopt disagree believe that with the right technique and the right policy can achieve scientific progress while live up to ethical responsibility that be what seek in when set forth administration 's policy allow federal funding for research on embryonic stem cell line where the life and death decision have already be make this balance approach have work under this policy human embryonic stem cell line be currently in use in research that be eligible for federal funding each of these line can be replicate many time and as a result the|national|institutes|of|health have help make more|than|700 shipment to researcher since there be no ban on embryonic stem cell research to the contrary even critic of policy concede that these federally fund line be be use in research every day by scientist around the world policy have allow to explore the potential of embryonic stem cell and have allow america to continue to lead the world in this area since announce policy in advance in scientific research have also show the great potential of stem cell that be derive without harm human embryo administration have expand the funding of research into stem cell that can be draw from child adult and the blood in umbilical cord with no harm to the donor and these stem cell be already be use in medical treatment with today be patient who have benefit from treatment with adult and umbilical cord blood stem cell and want to thank all for come applause be live proof that effective medical science can also be ethical researcher be now also investigate new technique that could allow doctor and scientist to produce stem cell just as versatile as those derive from human embryo technique scientist be explore would involve reprogramme an adult cell for example a skin cell to function like an embryonic stem cell science offer the hope that may day enjoy the potential benefit of embryonic stem cell without destroy human life must continue to explore these hopeful alternative and advance the cause of scientific research while stay true to the ideal of a decent and humane society the bill sign today uphold these humane ideal and draw an important ethical line to guide research the|fetus|farming|prohibition|act be sponsor by senators|santorum|and|brownback both who be here applause and by congressman dave|weldon along with nathan deal thank congressmen applause this good law prohibit of the most egregious abuse in biomedical research the trafficking in human fetus that be create with the sole intent of abort to harvest part human being be not a raw material to be exploit or a commodity to be buy or sell and this bill will help ensure that respect the fundamental ethical line be disappointed that congress fail to pass another bill that would have promote good research this bill be sponsor by senator santorum and senator arlen|specter and congressman roscoe|bartlett thank for come roscoe applause would have authorize additional federal funding for promise new research that could produce cell with the ability of embryonic cell but without the destruction of human embryo this be an important piece of legislation this bill be unanimously approve by the senate receive vote in the|house|of|representatives but be block by a minority in the house use procedural maneuver be disappointed that the house fail to authorize funding for this vital and ethical research make no sense to say that be in favor of find cure for terrible disease as quickly as possible and then block a bill that would authorize funding for promising and ethical stem cell research at a moment when ethical alternative be become available can not lose the opportunity to conduct research that would give hope to those suffer from terrible disease and help move nation beyond the current controversy over embryonic stem cell research must pursue this research and so direct the secretary of health|and|human|service secretary leavitt and the director of the|national|institutes|of|health to use all the tool at disposal to aid the search for stem cell technique that advance promise medical science in an ethical and morally responsible way applause unfortunately congress have send a bill that fail to meet this ethical test this legislation would overturn the balanced policy on embryonic stem cell research that administration have follow for this bill would also undermine the principle that congress have follow for more|than|a|decade when have prohibit federal funding for research that destroy human embryo if this bill would have become law american taxpayer would for the first time in history be compel to fund the deliberate destruction of human embryo and be not go to allow applause make clear to the congress that will not allow nation to cross this moral line feel like cross this line would be a mistake and once cross would find almost impossible to turn back cross the line would needlessly encourage a conflict between science and ethic that can only do damage to both and to nation as a whole if be to find the right way to advance ethical medical research must also be willing when necessary to reject the wrong way so today be keep the promise make to the american people by return this bill to congress with veto as science bring ever closer to unlock the secret of human biology also offer temptation to manipulate human life and violate human dignity conscience and history as a nation demand that resist this temptation america be found on the principle that be all create equal and endow by creator with the right to life can advance the cause of science while uphold this founding promise can harness the promise of technology without become slave to technology and can ensure that science serve the cause of humanity instead of the other way around america pursue medical advance in the name of life and will achieve the great breakthrough all seek with reverence for the gift of life believe america 's scientist have the ingenuity and skill to meet this challenge and look forward to work with congress and the scientific community to achieve these great and noble goal in the|years|ahead thank all for come and may god bless applause view transcript transcript thank all mr. speaker vice president cheney member of congress member of

needless cost association health plan for small business and employee expand health saving account and medical liability reform that will reduce health care cost and make sure patient have the doctor and care need to keep economy grow also need reliable supply of affordable environmentally responsible energy nearly|four|years|ago submit a comprehensive energy strategy that encourage conservation alternative source a modernized electricity grid and more production here at home include safe clean nuclear energy clear skies legislation will cut power plant pollution and improve the health of citizen and budget provide strong funding for lead edge technology from hydrogen fuel car to clean coal to renewable source such as ethanol four|year of debate be enough urge congress to pass legislation that make america more secure and less dependent on foreign energy all these proposal be essential to expand this economy and add new job but be just the beginning of duty to build the prosperity of future generation must update institution that be create to meet the need of an early time year|after|year americans be burden by an archaic incoherent federal tax code have appoint a bipartisan panel to examine the tax code from top to bottom and when recommendation be deliver and will work together to give this nation a tax code that be pro - growth easy to understand and fair to all america 's immigration system be also outdate — unsuite to the need of economy and to the value of country should not be content with law that punish hardworke people who want only to provide for family and deny business willing worker and invite chaos at border be time for an immigration policy that permit temporary guest worker to fill job americans will not take that reject amnesty that tell who be enter and leave country and that close the border to drug dealer and terrorist of america 's most important institution a symbol of the trust between generation be also in need of wise and effective reform social|security be a great moral success of the|20th|century and must honor great purpose in this|new|century the system however on current path be head toward bankruptcy and so must join together to strengthen and save social|security today more|than|45|million americans receive social|security benefit and million more be near retirement and for the system be strong and fiscally sound have a message for every american who be or old do not let anyone mislead for the social|security system will not change in any way for young worker the social|security system have serious problem that will grow bad with time social|security be create decades|ago for a very different era in those day people do not live as long benefit be much low than be today and a|half|century|ago about|16 worker pay into the system for each person draw benefit society have change in way the founder of social|security could not have foresee in today 's world people be live longer and therefore draw benefit longer and those benefit be schedule to rise dramatically over the|next|few|decade and instead of worker pay in for every beneficiary right now be only|about|three worker and over the|next|few|decade that number will fall to just worker per beneficiary with each pass year few worker be pay ever high benefit to an ever large number of retiree so here be the result thirteen|years|from|now in social|security will be pay out more than take in and every|year afterward will bring a new shortfall big than for example in the|year|2027 the government will somehow have to come up with an|extra|$200|billion to keep the system afloat and by the annual shortfall would be more|than|$300|billion by the|year|2042 the entire system would be exhaust and bankrupt if step be not take to avert that outcome the only solution would be drastically high taxis massive new borrowing or sudden and severe cut in social|security benefit or other government program recognize that and may seem like a long way off but those date be not so distant as any parent will tell if have a old be already concerned about how will pay for college tuition 13|year down the road if have get child in their|20s as some of do the idea of social|security collapse before retire do not seem like a small matter and should not be a small matter to the|united|states|congress and share a responsibility must pass reform that solve the financial problem of social|security once and for all fix social|security permanently will require an open candid review of the option some have suggest limit benefit for wealthy retiree former congressman tim|penny have raise the possibility of indexing benefit to price rather than wage during the|1990s predecessor president clinton speak of increase the retirement age former senator john|breaux suggest discourage early collection of social|security benefit the late senator daniel|patrick|moynihan recommend change the way benefit be calculate all these idea be on the table know that none of these reform would be easy but have to move ahead with courage and honesty because child 's retirement security be more important than partisan politic will work with member of congress to find the most effective combination of reform will listen to anyone who have a good idea to offer must however be guide by some basic principle must make social|security permanently sound not leave that task for another|day must not jeopardize economic strength by increase payroll taxis must ensure that low income americans get the help need to have dignity and peace of mind in retirement must guarantee that there be no change for those now retire or near retirement and must take care that any change in the system be gradual so young worker have year to prepare and plan for future as fix social|security also have the responsibility to make the system a well deal for young worker and the good way to reach that goal be through voluntary personal retirement account here be how the idea work right now a set portion of the money earn be take out of paycheck to pay for the social|security benefit of today 's retiree if be a young worker believe should be able to set aside part of that money in own retirement account so can build a nest egg for own future here be why personal account be a well deal money will grow over time at a great rate than anything the current system can deliver and account will provide money for retirement over and above the check will receive from social|security in addition will be able to pass along the money that accumulate in personal account if wish to child or grandchild and good of all the money in the account be yours and the government can never take away the goal here be great security in retirement so will set careful guideline for personal account will make sure the money can only go into a conservative mix of bond and stock fund will make sure that earning be not eat up by hide wall street fee will make sure there be good option to protect investment from sudden market swing on the eve of retirement will make sure a personal account can not be empty out all at once but rather pay out over time as an addition to traditional social|security benefit and will make sure this plan be fiscally responsible by start personal retirement account gradually and raise the yearly limit on contribution over time eventually permit all worker to set aside percentage point of payroll taxis in account personal retirement account should be familiar to federal employee because already have something similar call the|thrift|savings|plan which let worker deposit a portion of paycheck into any of different broadly base investment fund be time to extend the same security and choice and ownership to young americans second great responsibility to child and grandchild be to honor and to pass along the value that sustain a free society so many of generation after a long journey have come home to family and faith and be determined to bring up responsible moral child government be not the source of these value but government should never undermine because marriage be a sacred institution and the foundation of society should not be re - define by activist judge for the good of family child and society support a constitutional amendment to protect the institution of marriage because a society be measure by how treat the weak and vulnerable must strive to build a culture of life medical research can help reach that goal by develop treatment and cure that save life and help people overcome disability and thank congress for double the funding of the|national|institutes|of|health to build a culture of life must also ensure that scientific advance always serve human dignity

grow for body part and that human life be never buy and sell as a commodity america will continue to lead the world in medical research that be ambitious aggressive and always ethical because court must always deliver impartial justice judge have a duty to faithfully interpret the law not legislate from the bench as president have a constitutional responsibility to nominate man and woman who understand the role of court in democracy and be well qualified to serve on the bench and have do so the constitution also give the senate a responsibility every judicial nominee deserve an up or down vote because of the deep value of country be compassion must never turn away from any citizen who feel isolate from the opportunity of america government will continue to support faith base and

tennessee thank both for come as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;(applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;in that box be the bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;i do not intend to read all.&nbsp;&nbsp;(laughter.)&nbsp;&nbsp;it be not exactly light reading.&nbsp;&nbsp;(laughter but if be to read all would find that contain some very important principle that will help guide public school system for the|next|decades first principle be accountability.&nbsp;&nbsp;every school have a job to that be to teach the basic and teach well.&nbsp;&nbsp;if want to make sure no child be leave behind every child must learn to every child must learn to add and subtract.&nbsp;&nbsp;(applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;so in return for federal dollar be ask state to design accountability system to show parent and teacher whether or not child can read and write and add and subtract in grade through the fundamental principle of this bill be that every child can learn expect every child to learn and must show whether or not every child be learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;(applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;i read a quote time from a young lady in new york.&nbsp;&nbsp;she say do not ever remember take an exam.&nbsp;&nbsp;they just keep pass along.&nbsp;&nbsp;i end up drop out in the 7th grade.&nbsp;&nbsp;i basically feel nobody care the story of child be just shuffle through the system be of the sad story of america.&nbsp;&nbsp;let be just move through.&nbsp;&nbsp;it be so much easy to move a child through than try to figure out how to solve a child 's problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;the first step to make sure that a child be not shuffle through be to test that child as to whether or not or can read and write or add and subtract the first way to solve a problem be to diagnose it.&nbsp;&nbsp;and so what this bill say say every child can want to know early before be too late whether or not a child have a problem in learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;i understand take test be not fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;too bad.&nbsp;&nbsp;(laughter.)&nbsp;&nbsp;we need to know in america.&nbsp;&nbsp;we need to know whether or not child have get the basic education.&nbsp;&nbsp;(applause no longer be acceptable to hide poor performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;no longer be acceptable to keep result away from of the interesting thing about this bill say that be never go to give up on a school that be perform poorly that when find poor performance a school will be give time and incentive and resource to correct problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;a school will be give time to try other methodology perhaps other leadership to make sure that people can succeed.&nbsp;&nbsp;if however school do not perform if however give the new resource focused resource be unable to solve the problem of not educate child there must be real consequences.&nbsp;&nbsp;there must be a moment in which parent can say have have enough of this school.&nbsp;&nbsp;parent must be give real option in the face of failure in order to make sure reform be meaningful and so therefore this bill 's second principle be be that trust parent to make the right decision for children.&nbsp;&nbsp;any school that do not perform any school that can not catch up and do job a parent will have these option a well public school a tutor or a charter school.&nbsp;&nbsp;we do not want child trap in school that will not change and will not teach.&nbsp;&nbsp;(applause the third principle of this bill be that have get to trust the local folk on how to achieve standard to meet the standards.&nbsp;&nbsp;in washington there be some smart people there but the people who care most about the child in hamilton be the citizen of hamilton.&nbsp;&nbsp;the people who care most about the child in this school be the teacher and parent and school board members.&nbsp;&nbsp;(applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;and therefore school not only have the responsibility to improve now have the freedom to improve the federal government will not micromanage how school be run.&nbsp;&nbsp;we believe strongly believe strongly the good path to education reform be to trust the local so the new role of the federal government be to set high standard provide resource hold people accountable and liberate school district to meet the standard applause can not think of any well way to say to teacher trust and first of all have get to thank all the teacher who be here.&nbsp;&nbsp;i thank for teaching.&nbsp;&nbsp;(applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;yours be indeed a noble profession and society be well off because decide to teach.&nbsp;&nbsp;and by say trust local folk be really say trust you.&nbsp;&nbsp;we trust you.&nbsp;&nbsp;we want to have as much flexibility as possible to see to that every child that walk in classroom can succeed.&nbsp;&nbsp;so thank for what and a fourth principle be that be go to spend more money more resource but will be direct at method that work.&nbsp;&nbsp;not feel good method not sound good method but method that actually work particularly when come to reading.&nbsp;&nbsp;we're go to spend more on school and be go to spend more wisely if have learn anything over the last generation money alone do not make a good school.&nbsp;&nbsp;it certainly as john mention have spend billions|of|dollar with lousy results.&nbsp;&nbsp;so now be time to spend billions|of|dollar and get good results.&nbsp;&nbsp;(applause as john mention too many of kid can not read.&nbsp;&nbsp;you know a huge percentage of child in poverty can not read at grade level.&nbsp;&nbsp;that be not right in america.&nbsp;&nbsp;we're go to win the war overseas and need to win the war against illiteracy here at home as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;and so this bill applause so this bill focus on reading.&nbsp;&nbsp;it set a grand goal for the child will be read by the third grade that be not an impossible goal.&nbsp;&nbsp;it be a goal must meet if want every child to succeed.&nbsp;&nbsp;and so therefore triple the amount of federal funding for scientifically base early reading programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;we've get money in there to make sure teacher know how to teach what works.&nbsp;&nbsp;we've get money in there to help promote prove method of instruction there be no more excuse as far as be concerned about not teach child how to read.&nbsp;&nbsp;we know what works.&nbsp;&nbsp;the money be now available and be up to each local district to make sure happens.&nbsp;&nbsp;it be up to the citizen of hamilton to make sure no child be leave behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;and the federal government can spend money and can help set standard and can assist upon accountability.&nbsp;&nbsp;but the truth of the matter be school will flourish when citizen join in the noble cause of make sure no child be leave behind this be the end of a legislative process.&nbsp;&nbsp;signing this bill be the end of a long long time of people sit in room try to hammer out differences.&nbsp;&nbsp;it be a great symbol of what be possible in washington when good people come together to do what be be just the beginning of change.&nbsp;&nbsp;and now be up to the local citizen of great land the compassionate decent citizen of america to stand up and demand high standard and to demand that no child not single child in america be leave behind thank for let come.&nbsp;&nbsp;may god bless.&nbsp;&nbsp;(applause view transcript transcript mr. speaker mr. president pro|tempore member of congress and fellow americans:&nbsp;&nbsp in the normal

just in world thank good|night and god bless america view transcript transcript good evening.&nbsp;&nbsp;i appreciate give a|few|minute of time tonight so can discuss with a complex and difficult issue an issue that be of the most profound of time & the issue of research involve stem cell derive from human embryo be increasingly the subject of a national debate and dinner table discussions.&nbsp;&nbsp;the issue be confront every|day in laboratory as scientist ponder the ethical ramification of work.&nbsp;&nbsp;it be agonize over by parent and many couple as try to have child or to save child already bear & the issue be debate within the church with people of different faith even many of the same faith come to different people be find that the more know about stem cell research the less certain be about the right ethical and moral conclusion & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp administration must decide whether to allow federal fund tax dollar to be use for scientific research on stem cell derive from human embryos.&nbsp;&nbsp;a large number of these embryo already exist.&nbsp;&nbsp;they be the product of a process call in fertilization which help so many couple conceive children.&nbsp;&nbsp;when doctor match sperm and egg to create life outside the womb usually produce more embryo than be plant in the mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;once a couple successfully have child or if be unsuccessful the additional embryo remain frozen in laboratory & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp some will not survive during long storage other be number have be donate to science and use to create privately fund stem cell a few have be implant in an adoptive mother and bear and be today healthy child & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp base on preliminary work that have be privately fund scientist believe further research use stem cell offer great promise that could help improve the life of those who suffer from many terrible disease from juvenile diabete to alzheimer 's from parkinson 's to spinal cord injuries.&nbsp;&nbsp;and while scientist admit be not yet certain believe stem cell derive from embryo have unique potential & should also know that stem cell can be derive from source other than embryo from adult cell from umbilical cord that be discard after baby be bear from human many scientist feel research on these type of stem cell be also promising.&nbsp;&nbsp;many patient suffer from a range of disease be already be help with treatment develop from adult stem cell & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp however most scientist at least today believe that research on embryonic stem cell offer the most promise because these cell have the potential to develop in all of the tissue in the body & scientist further believe that rapid progress in this research will come only with federal funds.&nbsp;&nbsp;federal|dollars help attract the good and bright scientists.&nbsp;&nbsp;they ensure new discovery be widely share at the large number of research facility and that the research be direct toward the great public good & the|united|state have a long and proud record of lead the world toward advance in science and medicine that improve human life.&nbsp;&nbsp;and the|united|state have a long and proud record of uphold the high standard of ethic as expand the limit of science and knowledge research on embryonic stem cell raise profound ethical question because extract the stem cell destroy the embryo and thus destroy potential for life.&nbsp;&nbsp;like a snowflake each of these embryo be unique with the unique genetic potential of an individual human being & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp as think through this issue keep return to fundamental questions:&nbsp;&nbsp;first be these frozen embryos human life and therefore something precious to be protected?&nbsp;&nbsp;and second if be go to be destroy anyway should not be use for a great good for research that have the potential to save and improve other life & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp have ask those question and other of scientist scholar bioethicist religious leader doctor researcher member of congress cabinet and friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;i have read heartfelt letter from many americans.&nbsp;&nbsp;i have give this issue a great deal of thought prayer and considerable reflection.&nbsp;&nbsp;and have find widespread disagreement & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp on the first issue be these embryo human life well researcher tell believe this day old cluster of cell be not an embryo not yet an individual but a pre - embryo.&nbsp;&nbsp;he argue that have the potential for life but be not a life because can not develop on own & an ethicist dismiss that as a callous attempt at rationalization make no mistake tell that cluster of cell be the same way and and all the rest of start lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;one go with a heavy heart if use these say because be deal with the seed of the next generation & and to the other crucial question if these be go to be destroy anyway why not use for good purpose also find different argue these embryo be byproduct of a process that help create life and should allow couple to donate to science so can be use for good purpose instead of waste potential.&nbsp;&nbsp;other will argue there be no such thing as excess life and the fact that a living being be go to die do not justify experiment on or exploit as a natural resource & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp at core this issue force to confront fundamental question about the beginning of life and the end of science.&nbsp;&nbsp;it lie at a difficult moral intersection juxtapose the need to protect life in all phase with the prospect of save and improve life in all stage & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp as the discovery of modern science create tremendous hope also lie vast ethical mine fields.&nbsp;&nbsp;as the genius of science extend the horizon of what can do increasingly confront complex question about what should have arrive at that brave new world that seem so distant in when aldous|huxley write about human being create in test tube in what call a hatchery & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp in recent|weeks learn that scientist have create human embryo in test tube solely to experiment on be deeply troubling and a warning sign that should prompt all of to think through these issue very carefully & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp embryonic stem cell research be at the leading edge of a series of moral hazards.&nbsp;&nbsp;the initial stem cell researcher be at first reluctant to begin research fear may be use for human cloning.&nbsp;&nbsp;scientist have already clone a sheep.&nbsp;&nbsp;researcher be tell the next step could be to clone human being to create individual designer stem cell essentially to grow another to be available in case need another heart or lung or liver & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp strongly oppose human cloning as do most americans.&nbsp;&nbsp;we recoil at the idea of grow human being for spare body part or create life for convenience.&nbsp;&nbsp;and while must devote enormous energy to conquer disease be equally important that pay attention to the moral concern raise by the new frontier of human embryo stem cell research even the most noble end do not justify any mean & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp position on these issue be shape by deeply hold beliefs.&nbsp;&nbsp;i'm a strong supporter of science and technology and believe have the potential for incredible good to improve life to save life to conquer disease.&nbsp;&nbsp;research offer hope that million of love one may be cure of a disease and rid of suffering.&nbsp;&nbsp;i have friend whose child suffer from juvenile diabetes.&nbsp;&nbsp;nancy reagan have write about president reagan 's struggle with alzheimer's.&nbsp;&nbsp;my own family have confront the tragedy of childhood leukemia.&nbsp;&nbsp;and like all americans have great hope for cure & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp also believe human life be a sacred gift from creator.&nbsp;&nbsp;i worry about a culture that devalue life and believe as president have an important obligation to foster and encourage respect for life in america and throughout the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;and while be all hopeful about the potential of this research no one can be certain that the science will live up to the hope have generate & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp eight|years|ago scientist believe fetal tissue research offer great hope for cure and treatment yet the progress to date have not live up to initial expectations.&nbsp;&nbsp;embryonic stem cell research offer both great promise and great peril.&nbsp;&nbsp;so have decide must proceed with great care & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp as a result of private research more|than|60 genetically diverse stem cell line already exist.&nbsp;&nbsp;they be create from embryo that have already be destroy and have the ability to regenerate indefinitely create ongoing opportunity for research.&nbsp;&nbsp;i have conclude that should allow federal fund to be use for research on these exist stem cell line where the life and death decision have already be make & lead scientist tell research on these line have great promise that could lead to breakthrough therapy and cures.&nbsp;&nbsp;this allow to explore the promise and potential of stem cell research without cross a fundamental moral line by provide taxpayer funding that would sanction or encourage further destruction of human embryo that have at least the potential for life & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp also believe that great scientific progress can be make through aggressive federal funding of research on umbilical cord placenta adult and animal stem cell which do not involve the same moral dilemma.&nbsp;&nbsp;this|year government will spend on this important research & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp will also name a president 's council to monitor stem cell research to recommend appropriate guideline and regulation and to consider all of the medical and ethical ramification of biomedical innovation.&nbsp;&nbsp;this council will consist of lead scientist doctor ethicist lawyer theologian and other and will be chair by dr. leon|kass a lead biomedical ethicist from the|university|of|chicago & this council will keep apprise of new development and give nation a forum to continue to discuss and evaluate these important issue as go forward hope will always be guide by both intellect and heart by both capability and conscience & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp have make this decision with great care and pray be the right & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp thank for night and god

and public health expert address a plague of this magnitude require scientific accountability to ensure result and finally understand the importance of innovation in create lifesaving medicine that

and to oppose those who would tear apart here be the fundamental challenge believe america must meet to shape the|21st|century world first must continue to encourage former adversary russia and china to emerge as stable prosperous democratic nation both be be hold back today from reach full potential russia by the legacy of communism an economy in turmoil a cruel and self defeat war in chechnya

be constructive member of global community that ’s why should support those russians who be struggle for a democratic prosperous future continue to reduce both nuclear arsenal and help russia to safeguard weapon and material that remain and that ’s why believe congress should support the agreement negotiate to bring china into the wto by pass permanent normal trade relation with china as soon as possible this|year think ought to do for reason first of all market be already open to china this agreement will open china ’s market to and second will plainly advance the cause of peace in asia

in cold blood this be not war in the traditional sense be an attack by tank and artillery on a largely defenseless people whose leader already have agree to peace end this tragedy be a moral imperative be also important to america 's national interest take a look at this map kosovo be a small place but sit on a major fault line between europe asia and the|middle|east at the meeting place of islam and both the western and orthodox branch of christianity to the south be ally greece and turkey to the north new democratic ally in central europe and all around kosovo there be other small country struggle with own economic and political challenge country that could be overwhelm by a large new wave of refugee from kosovo all the ingredient for a major war be there ancient grievance struggle democracy and in the center of all a dictator in serbia who have do nothing since the cold war end but start new war and pour gasoline on the flame of ethnic and religious division sarajevo the capital of neighbor bosnia be where world|war|i begin world|war|ii and the holocaust engulf this region in both war europe be slow to recognize the danger and the|united|state wait even longer to enter the conflict just imagine if leader back then have act wisely and early enough how many life could have be save how many americans would not have have to die learn some of the same lesson in bosnia just a|few|years|ago the world do not act early enough to stop that war either and let not forget what happen innocent people herd into concentration camp child gun down by sniper on way to school soccer field and park turn into cemetery a|quarter|of|a|million people kill not because of anything have do but because of who be two|million bosnians become refugee this be genocide in the heart of europe not in but in not in some grainy newsreel from parent ' and grandparent ' time but in own time test humanity and resolve at the time many people believe nothing could be do to end the bloodshed in bosnia say well that be just the way those people in the balkans be but when and ally join with courageous bosnians to stand up to the aggressor help to end the war learn that in the balkans inaction in the face of brutality simply invite more brutality but firmness can stop army and save life must apply that lesson in kosovo before what happen in bosnia happen there too over the|last|few|month have do everything possibly could to solve this problem peacefully secretary albright have work tirelessly for a negotiate agreement mr. milosevic have refuse on sunday send ambassador dick|holbrooke to serbia to make clear to again on behalf of the|united|state and nato ally that must honor own commitment and stop repression or face military action again refuse today and nato ally agree to do what say would do what must do to restore the peace mission be clear to demonstrate the seriousness of nato 's purpose so that the serbian leader understand the imperative of reverse course to deter an even bloody offensive against innocent civilian in kosovo and if necessary to seriously damage the serbian military 's capacity to harm the people of kosovo in short if president milosevic will not make peace will limit ability to make war now want to be clear with there be risk in this military action risk to pilot and the people on the ground serbia 's air defense be strong could decide to intensify assault on kosovo or to seek to harm or ally elsewhere if do will deliver a forceful response hopefully mr. milosevic will realize present course be self destructive and unsustainable if decide to accept the peace agreement and demilitarize kosovo nato have agree to help to implement with a peacekeeping force if nato be invite to do so troop should take part in that mission to keep the peace but do not intend to put troop in kosovo to fight a war do interest in kosovo justify the danger to armed|force have think long and hard about that question be convince that the danger of acting be far outweigh by the danger of not act danger to defenseless people and to national interest if and ally be to allow this war to continue with no response president milosevic would read hesitation as a license to kill there would be many more massacre tens|of|thousand more refugee more victim cry out for revenge right now firmness be the only hope the people of kosovo have to be able to live in own country without have to fear for own life remember ask to accept peace and do ask to promise to lay down arm and agree pledge that the|united|state and the other nation of nato would stick by if do the right thing can not let down now imagine what would happen if and ally instead decide just to look the other way as these people be massacre on nato

partner in the work of build peace the challenge of resolve the tension between greece and turkey and build bridge with the islamic world and finally the challenge of end instability in the balkans so

think about what child can do if could put every child in america from the poor inner city to the most remote rural area in a classroom with a computer that be hook up to the entire information superhighway then for the first time ever every child in america would have access to the same learning in the same way at the same time that would revolutionize what child could do all of child if

’s what america ’s all about remember get future back from doctor and nurse and a doctor in chicago name dr. kelikian and ever since that time have try to give something back to country to the people who be watch tonight america be the great place on the face of the earth and know million of still have anxiety work harder and harder to make end meet and put food on the table worry about the quality and the safety of child and the quality of education but even more importantly worry about the future and will have the same opportunity that and have have and jack|kemp and want to share with some idea tonight jack|kemp be runningmate do an outstanding job now be a plain speak man and learn long ago that word be bond and promise tonight that will try to address concern and not try to exploit ’ a tall order but have be run against the odd for a long time and again be honor to be here this|evening federal government ’s role lehrer mr. president first question there ’s a major difference in view of the role of the federal government and that of senator dole how would define the difference president clinton well jim believe that the federal government should give people the tool and try to establish the condition in which can make the most of own life that to be the key and that lead to some different conclusion from senator dole for example have reduce the size of the federal government to small size in have reduce more regulation eliminate more program than republican predecessor but have work hard for thing like the family and medical leave law the brady bill the assault weapon ban the program to put police on the street all of these be program that senator dole oppose that support because feel be a legitimate effort to help people make the most of own life have work hard to help family impart value to own child support the v chip so that parent would be able to control what kid watch on television when be young along with the rating system for television and educational television support strong action against the tobacco company to stop the marketing advertising and sale of tobacco to young people support a big increase in the safe and drug free school program these be area on which senator dole and differ but believe that be the right area for america to be act together as country to help individual and family make the most of own life and raise kid with good value and a good future lehrer senator dole one|minute senator dole think the basic difference be and have have some experience in this think the basic difference trust the people the president trust the government if go back and look at the health care plan that want to impose on the american people seventh the total economy new taxis price control 35|to|50 new bureaucracy a cost of do not forget that that happen in a tax increase that tax everybody in america not just the rich if make 25,000—that ’s the original proposal get social|security taxis increase have a btu tax that turn into a gas tax a tax increase guess rely more on the individual carry a little card around in pocket call the 10th amendment where possible want to give power back to the states and back to the people that ’s difference for the present and will have specific difference later note a few but there be other lehrer mr. president president clinton trust the people have do a lot to give the people more power to make own decision over own life but do think be right when try to for example give mother and newborn before can be kick out of the hospital end these drive by delivery think be right to pass the|kassebaum kennedy bill which state can not lose health insurance just because change job or because someone in family have be sick government be small and less bureaucratic and have give more authority to the state than predecessor under republican president but do believe have to help people get ready to succeed in the|21st|century state of the nation lehrer senator dole the president say in opening statement be well off today than be do agree senator dole well ’s better off than be laughter president clinton agree with that that ’s right senator dole and may be well off four|years|from|now do not know look at the slow growth in a|century inherit a growth of now ’s down to about|2.4|percent be go to pass a|million bankruptcy this|year for the first time in history have get stagnant wage in fact woman ’s wage have drop man ’s wage have not go up go down so have stagnation have the high foreign debt in history and seem to that if take a look — be better off well guess some may be well off be probably well off than be rene|preval be probably well off than be but be the american people be work harder and harder and pay more taxis for the first time in history pay about|40|percent of what earn more than spend for food clothing and shelter combine for taxis under this administration so some may be well off talk about family income be up that ’s not true in connecticut family income be down and ’ up in some case because both parent be work work for the family and work to pay taxis for the government be go to give a tax cut so can spend more time with child maybe even take a vacation that ’s what america be all about lehrer mr. president one|minute president clinton well let say first of all in february senator dole acknowledge that the american economy be in the good shape ’s be in in have more job a fast job growth rate than under any republican administration since the|1920s wage be go up for the first time in a|decade have record number of new small business have the big drop in the number of people in poverty in all group of people be grow have the big drop in income inequality in the average family ’s income have go up over|$1,600 just since economic plan pass so think ’ clear that be better off than be now need to focus on what do need to do to be well off still how can help people as be to get retirement when work for small business to be able to afford health insurance to be able to educate child that ’s what want to focus on but be clearly better off than be as senator dole acknowledge this|year lehrer senator dole senator dole doubt that acknowledge that this|year but in any event think just look at the fact ask the people that be view tonight “ be well off than be four|years|ago ’s not whether be better off ’s whether be better off be work harder to put food on the table to feed child be child get a well education drug use have double the|past|44|month all across america crime have go down but ’s because of mayor like rudy|giuliani where third of the drop happen in city new|york|city so yes some may be well off but of the people listen tonight the work family who will benefit from economic package will be well off when bob|dole be president and jack|kemp be vice president medicare reform lehrer mr. president senator dole have come pretty close in the|last|few|day to accuse of lie about position on medicare reform have do so president clinton absolutely not let look at the position first of all remember that in this campaign season since senator dole have be a candidate have brag about the fact that vote against medicare in the beginning in of only|12 member say do the right thing then know would not work at the time that ’s what say then budget that pass along with speaker gingrich cut medicare more than be necessary to repair the|medicare|trust|fund would have charge senior more for out of pocket cost as well as more in premium because doctor could have charge more the|american|hospital|association the nurse association the|catholic|hospital|association all say hundred of hospital could close and people would be hurt badly under the dole gingrich medicare plan that veto and now with this risky tax scheme of senator dole ’s even own friend campaign cochair senator d’amato say that can not possibly pay for without cut medicare more and cut social|security as well accord to now balanced budget plan add 10|year to the life of the medicare|trust year and will have time to deal with the long term problem of the baby boomer but be simply wrong to finance last scheme to cut medicare to run the risk of wither on the vine always have to reform over the|year but need someone who believe in to reform lehrer senator dole senator dole well must say look back at the vote on medicare in have a program call eldercare that also provide drug and be mean test so people who need medical attention receive think be a good program but have support medicare ever since in fact use to go home and mother would tell — say “ bob all have get be social|security and medicare do not cut would not violate anything mother say in fact have a conversation about mother a very poignant conversation in the|white|house be concern about health care have have the good health care in government hospital army hospital and know importance but have get to fix ’ trustee the president ’s trustee not who say ’s go to go broke do not fix for ought to appoint a commission just as do with social|security in when rescue social|security and be proud to be on that commission along with claude|pepper the champion of senior citizen from florida and can do again if take politic out of stop scar the senior mr. president have already spend scar senior and tear apart think ’s time to have a truce lehrer mr. president president clinton well let say first of all would be happy to have a commission deal with this and appreciate what senator dole do on the social|security commission but will not be possible to do if tax scheme pass because even own campaign co - chair senator d’amato say will have to cut medicare even more than be cut in the bill that veto veto that bill because cut more medicare and basically run the risk of break up the system balanced budget plan put 10|year onto medicare ought to do that then can have a commission but senator dole ’s plan be not good for the country senator dole ’s tax cut proposal lehrer senator dole speak of tax plan do still think that ’s a good idea the across the board tax cut senator dole oh yes and will be eligible laughter president clinton too senator dole and so will the former president yes laughter president clinton that ’s good need senator dole well the people need that ’s the point this be not a wall street tax cut this be a family tax cut this be a main|street tax cut fifteen|percent across — let ’s take a family make a year that ’s now maybe to some in this|bushnell|memorial that ’s not a lot of money but people watch tonight with a couple of kid a work family that ’s four|or|five|months|of|day care maybe a personal computer may be three|or|four|month of mortgage payment this economic package be about family but ’ a point package first of all ’s a balanced budget amendment to the constitution which president clinton defeat twist arm and get democrats to vote the other way lose by vote ’s balance the budget by the|year|2002 ’ the tax cut cut capital gain so that can go out and create more job and more opportunity ’ a state tax relief ’ a child tax credit ’ about litigation reform now that the president get millions|of|dollar from the trial lawyer probably do not like this provision in fact when fall off that podium in chico before hit the ground have a call on cell phone from a trial lawyer say “ think have get a case here laughter and ’s also regulatory reform so ’ a good package mr. president and would like to have support lehrer mr. president president clinton well here ’s the problem with sound very good but there ’s a reason that economist include nobel|prize winner and business periodical like business|week and even senator dole ’s friend senator warren|rudman former republican senator from new|hampshire say be not a practical program ’ a tax scheme that will cause a big hole in the deficit which will raise interest rate and slow down the economy and cause people to pay more for home mortgage car payment credit card payment college loan and small business loan ’s not good to raise the deficit have work too hard to lower will actually raise taxis on people and in addition to that will force big cut in medicare medicaid education and the environment than the one that and mr. gingrich pass that veto last|year so sound great but target tax cut for education childrearing health care and homebuying which be pay for in balanced budget plan something that have not do — certify by the|congressional|budget|office that ’s the right way to go lehrer senator dole senator dole the president want to increase spend over the|next|six|year want to increase spend that ’s how simple be want the government to pinch penny for a change instead of the american family be talk about percentage point over six|year and with that money give back to the work people also provide opportunity scholarship so low income parent will have the same choice that other have in send child to well school and will work and when do work mr. president know will congratulate campaign financing lehrer mr. president the senator mention trial lawyer and that mean campaign financing how do personally avoid be unduly influence by people who give money or give service in campaign president clinton well try to articulate position as clearly as possible tell people what stand for and let decide whether be go to support or not the senator mention the trial lawyer in the case of the product liability bill which pass and veto — think that ’s what ’s talk about — actually want to sign that bill and tell the people exactly what the congress exactly what kind of bill would sign now a lot of the trial lawyer do not want to sign any bill at all but think ought to do what could to cut frivolous lawsuit but would not make some of the change that think should be make and let just give an example have a person in the oval office who lose a child in a schoolbus accident where a drunk driver cause the accident directly but there be problem with the schoolbus the drunk driver have no money under the new bill if have sign a person like that could never have have any recovery think that be wrong so give or specific example to the congress and say prove to that these people could recover but be go to eliminate frivolous lawsuit will sign the bill but generally believe that a president have to be willing to do what think be right have do a lot of thing that be controversial economic plan trade position take on the nra for the first time take on the tobacco company for the first time sometimes just have to do that because know ’ right for the country over the long run that ’s what have try to do and that ’s what will continue to do as president lehrer senator dole senator dole mean how do avoid the conflict well do not know in the case of the trial lawyer when look at the trial lawyer and when be a|few|million short run out to hollywood and pick up and organize labor come to and put into the pot now if these be not special interest then have get a lot to learn be there for a while before leave on june|11th the trial lawyer don’t wife be a lawyer be the only|two lawyer in washington that trust each other but be lawyer like lawyer do not dislike trial lawyer but seem to there have get to be some end to the frivolous lawsuit and there ’s get to be some cap on punitive damage be put a lot of business people out of business small business man and small business woman who pay of tax increase the large tax increase in the history of america say that one|day and pat|moynihan — and the democrats say no — say in the history of the world so modify the large tax increase in the history of the world and seem to that there be a problem there mr. president and will address as mr. president do not do that with president bush in lehrer mr. president president clinton let say first of all sign a tort reform bill that deal with civilian aviation a|couple|of|years|ago have prove that will sign reasonable tort reform secondly senator dole have have some pretty harsh comment about special interest money but be not who oppose what try to do to save the life of child who be subject to tobacco and then go to the tobacco grower and brag about stand up to the federal government when try to stop the advertising marketing and sale of tobacco to child and be not that let the polluter actually come into the hall of congress into the room and rewrite the environmental law that ’s what speaker gingrich and senator dole do not senator dole that ’s not true president clinton so believe that should take a different approach to this and talk about how stand on the issue instead of try to characterize each other ’s motivation think senator dole and just honestly disagree lehrer well senator dole let ask the same question ask the president how do avoid be influence by people who contribute money and service to campaign senator dole think ’s very difficult let be honest about that ’s why need campaign finance reform that ’s why reach out to the perot voter and have do about all that be the reform party and the perot voter who be look for a home ought to take a look at the republican record whatever be whatever the checklist be in ’s all do but campaign finance reform work with senator mitchell who play guess in the debate warmup try six|or|eight|years|ago to — appoint people appoint people to get campaign finance reform could not get do because be not enforceable suggest a commission newt|gingrich do have suggest that at|least|four or year ago have a commission on campaign finance reform send to congress and have to vote up or down that ’s how work be never go to fix by the party because democrats want a well advantage for want a well advantage as republicans and that ’s not how ’s go to work but want to touch on this tobacco thing know the president ’s be puff a lot on that but want to go back to that be first vote against tobacco company when say ought to label cigarette and have have a consistent record ever since pass a bill in to encourage the states to adopt program to stop kid from smoking all state do take three|years be not until election|year mr. president that ever think about stop smoking what about drug that have increase — double in the|last|44|months cocaine be up or marijuana cocaine up and seem to that have a selective memory do not work that way so just want to try to correct as go along lehrer mr. president president clinton mr. lehrer hope will have a chance to discuss drug later in the program but let respond to what say agree that too many incumbent politician in washington in both party have consistently oppose campaign finance reform that be certainly the case from the|minute get there so after speaker gingrich and senator dole take over the congress go to new|hampshire and a man suggest — a gentleman that unfortunately just pass away a|couple|of|days|ago suggest that appoint a commission and shake hand with on and appoint member and the commission never meet and then senator dole ’s ardent supporter senator mccain who be out there today along with senator feingold support — sponsor a campaign finance reform proposal strongly support and member of senator dole ’s own party in the senate kill and be not out there urge to vote for the mccain feingold bill so think the american people include the perot supporter know that have have a consistent record in favor of campaign finance reform and will continue to have and hope can finally get in the next session of congress because need badly lehrer senator dole senator dole well on campaign reform be go to get when have a bipartisan commission take out of politic get people who do not have any interest in politic but understand the issue and let make a recommendation to congress now be not kid anybody mr. president these be sophisticated people watch tonight millions|and|million of americans know have not do know the|democratic|party will not do ought to agree that somebody else should do and then have to vote up or down president clinton agree & nbsp teenage drug use lehrer mr. president the senator mention drug ’s suggest in the past that bear some responsibility for the rise in drug use of teenager in the|united|state be right president clinton well jim think every american in any position of responsibility should be concerned about what ’s happen be but let look at the overall record overall in america cocaine use have drop in casual drug use down the tragedy be that young people be still increase use of drug up to about|11|percent total with marijuana and regret let tell what have try to do about appoint a star general who lead effort south of the border to keep drug from come into the country as nation ’s drug czar the most heavily decorate soldier in uniform when retire submit the big drug budget ever have dramatically increase control and enforcement at the border support a crime bill that have death penalty include the death penalty for drug kingpin and support a big expansion in the safe and drug free school program to support thing like the d.a.r.e. program because think all those thing be very important do think that bear some responsibility for the fact that too many of child still do not understand drug be wrong drug can kill even though have consistently oppose the legalization of drug all public life and work hard against think all do and hope can do better do not think this issue should be politicize because record be clear and do not think senator dole support use drug think just have to continue to work on this until those who think be not dangerous and will not kill and will not destroy life get the message and change lehrer senator senator dole again be very selective mr. president do not want to politicize drug but ’s all right to politicize medicare and go out and scare senior citizen and other vulnerable group veteran and people who get pell grant and thing like this mean say have do all these bad thing which be not the case but seem to the record be clear the record be pretty clear in arkansas when be governor drug use double resist the appointment of a drug czar there because think may interfere with treatment but here cut the drug czar ’s office have cut interdiction substantially that ’s what want to stop from come across the border and in administration be go to train the|national|guard to stop from come across the border this be an invasion of drug from all over the world and have a responsibility have a surgeon general mccaffrey have a lady who say ought to consider legalize drug be that the kind of leadership need and will not comment on other thing that have happen in administration or past about drug but seem to the kid ought to if have start ought to stop and just do not do lehrer mr. president president clinton let say again do have a drug czar in arkansas but answer to the governor just like this one answer to the president that ’s what think ought to do secondly senator dole vote against the crime bill that have the death penalty for drug kingpin in and vote to cut service to school child under the|safe|and|drug free|schools|act do not think that mean be soft on drug just have a different approach but let remind that family have suffer from drug abuse know what ’s like to see somebody love nearly lose life and hate drug senator need to do this together and can & nbsp gun control lehrer senator dole on the government — continue to talk about the government ’s role if elect president would seek to repeal the brady bill and the ban on assault weapon senator dole not if do not have a well idea but have get a well idea ’s something have work on for ’s call the automate check or the instant check ’s be use in state right now states like florida colorado virginia and other state do not buy any gun do not get any gun have get name on a computer in of people who should not have a gun ought to keep gun out of the hand of criminal and there be other category that should not have gun have be work on this for a long long time walk in put little card in there if say “ tilt do not get any gun do not get a handgun do not get a rifle do not get a shotgun get zippo if be go to protect american child and american family and people who live as prisoner in own home have get to stop gun from be dump on the street the administration say support the instant check have appropriate about|$200|million but only spend about|$3|million to get underway in administration in administration will expedite this keep up the technology keep gun out of the hand of people who should not have gun that be the bottom line and believe ’s a good idea have strong bipartisan support and perhaps that ’s another thing can depoliticize talk about the brady bill there ’s only be prosecution under the brady bill — only|one under the assault weapon ban and only|seven under the brady bill that talk about all the time and on the assault weapon ban out of weapon that be ban only|six be ban now because have be modify and be back on the street let get together on this instant check because that will really make a difference lehrer mr. president president clinton the president let say first of all senator dole have go back and forth about whether would be for repeal the brady bill or repeal the assault weapon ban and think present position be that would not do so and if that ’s true be grateful for but let look at the fact here the brady bill have keep at|least|60,000 felon fugitive and stalker from get handgun senator dole lead the fight against the brady bill try to keep from come to desk do not succeed and sign and be glad do then when have the assault weapon ban in the senate senator dole fight bitterly and oppose the entire crime bill and almost bring the entire crime bill down because the|national|rifle|association do not want the assault weapon ban just like do not want the brady bill but two|years|later nobody have lose handgun mean rifle have expand the brady bill to cover people who beat up spouse and kid and this be a safe country so be glad take on that fight and believe with all respect be right and be wrong senator dole well the president do not have quite right mean seem to at the time that the assault weapon ban be not effective but that ’s history as tell the nra that ’s history be not go to worry about anymore be not go to worry about anymore let do something well let stop play the political game mr. president talk about this and this add up all the states who have use the instant check and how many weapon have keep out of the hand of criminal would far surpass the number mention so in view if want to be protect ought to vote for bob|dole and will get the instant check pass and will keep gun out of the hand of criminal & nbsp foreign policy lehrer mr. president senator dole say the|other|day that practice a photo op foreign policy that have lessen the credibility of the|united|state throughout the world be wrong about that president clinton if that ’s what say ’s not right about that look at where be today the|united|state be still the indispensable nation in the aftermath of and on the brink of the|21st|century have work to support country as the world ’s strong force for peace and freedom prosperity and security have do the follow thing number have manage the aftermath of support a big drop in nuclear weapon in russia the removal of russian troop from the baltics the integration of central and eastern|european democracy into a new partnership with nato and may add with a democratic russia there be no nuclear missile point at the child of tonight and have not be in administration for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age have work hard for peace and freedom when take office haiti be govern by a dictator that have defy the|united|state when take office the bad war in europe be wag in bosnia now there be a democratically elect president in haiti peace in bosnia have just have election there have make progress in northern|ireland and the|middle|east have also stand up to the new threat of terrorism the proliferation of weapon of mass destruction organize crime and have work hard to expand america ’s economic presence around the world with the big increase in trade with the large number of new trade agreement in history that ’s of the reason america be number in auto production again lehrer senator senator dole well have a different view again have support the president on bosnia and think be tell the troop would be out in a|year now understand ’s be extend til sometime|next|year but let start with somalia where drag americans through the street and where americans be kill because do not have be pin down for eight|hours the rangers do not have the weapon do not have the tank ask for the tank do not get the tank from this administration because be nation building ’s call mission creep turn over to the|united|nation the president do not have much to do about look at haiti where have spend about|$3|billion and get an alarm call there about|two|weeks|ago “ have get to send down some more people because the president have find out there be death squad on own property so need more protection from america bosnia northern|ireland — there be no cease fire in bosnia think there be still lot of problem in bosnia agree to train and arm the muslims so could defend the policy have when run in have not do that be way behind which mean americans can not come home americans should not have go there in the first place have let defend as have a right to do under article|57|of|the|united|nations|charter lehrer mr. president president clinton first of all take full responsibility for what happen in somalia but the american people must remember that those soldier be under an american commander when that happen believe do the good could under the circumstance and let not forget that hundreds|of|thousand of life be save there secondly in haiti political violence be much much small than be thirdly in bosnia ’ a virtual miracle that there have be no return to war and at least there have now be an election and the institution be begin to function in northern|ireland and the|middle|east be well off than be there will always be problem in this old world but if be move in the right direction and america be lead be better off lehrer senator dole if elect president what criterion would use to decide when to send u.s. troop into harm ’s way senator dole well after world|war|i have a policy of disengagement then from world|war|i|to|world|war|ii have sort of a compulsory engagement policy now think have to have a selective engagement policy have to determine when interest be involve not the united|nation ’ interest and many of the thing the president talk about turn over to the|united|nation decide ’s deploy more troop than any president in history around the world ’s cost billions|and|billions|of|dollar for peacekeeping operation these be fact and seem to that when make a decision the decision be make by the president of the|united|state by the commander in chief make that decision when commit young man or young woman who be go to go around and defend liberty and freedom that would be position then be go to have a top down review at the pentagon not a bottom up review where all fight over how much money be there want a top down review to determine what priority be and what should do in defense and then follow that policy instead of this bottom up review with all of the service fight for the money the president say be go to cut defense cut defense devastate states like california and other and think now have get a problem have get to go back and look ’s just like say in texas know raise taxis too much and do — and cut defense too much mr. president — and do and may have say that too but the bottom line be be the strong nation in the world provide the leadership and be go to have to continue to provide the leadership but let do on term when interest be involve and not when somebody blow a whistle at the|united|nation president clinton military be the strong military in the world be the strong best prepared best equip have ever be there be very little difference in the budget that have propose and the republican budget over the|next|six year|period be spend a lot of money to modernize weapon system have propose a lot of new investment to improve the quality of life for soldier for man and woman in uniform for family for training that be solemn obligation ask when do decide to deploy the interest of the american people must be at stake value must be at stake have to be able to make a difference and frankly have to consider what the risk be to young man and woman in uniform but believe the evidence be that deployment have be successful in haiti in bosnia when move to kuwait to repel saddam|hussein ’s threaten invasion of kuwait when have send the fleet into the|taiwan|strait when have work hard to end the north|korean nuclear threat believe the|united|state be at peace tonight in part because of the disciplined careful effective deployment of military resource lehrer senator dole senator dole well fail to mention north|korea and cuba a while ago look at north|korea where have enough plutonium to build nuclear bomb where have sort of distance from ally lose about|a|million people in the war the korean war the forget war lose americans should not be do any favor for north|korea ’ a closed society do not have any inspection do not know whether ’s go to work or not but keep give these incentive some would call something else incentive do not know what ’s go to happen here have cuba from shore and what have do have pass a law that give people the right to sue and the president postpone for six|month and seem to if want to send a signal have get to send a signal mr. president the sooner the well off will be if put tough sanction on castro not try to make easy for cuba lehrer well mr. president what be attitude toward cuba and how cuba should be treat president clinton well first of all for have work hard to put more and more pressure on the castro government to bring about more openness and a move toward democracy in before become president congress pass the|cuba|democracy|act and enforce vigorously make the embargo tough but increase contact people to people with the cubans include direct telephone service which be largely support by the cuban american community then cuba shoot down of plane and murder people in international airspace be completely beyond the pale of the law and sign the|helms burton legislation senator dole be correct do give about|six|month before the effective date of the act before lawsuit can actually be file even though be effective now and can be legally bind because want to change cuba and the|united|states need help from other country nobody in the world agree with policy on cuba now but this law can be use as leverage to get other country to help to move cuba to democracy every single country in latin|america central|america and the caribbean be a democracy tonight but cuba and if stay firm and strong will be able to bring cuba around as well senator dole well that ’s the point make — have to be firm and strong and hope that will happen will happen start next|january and maybe can happen the balance of this|year have not be firm and strong if look at the poor people who still live in cuba ’ a haven for drug smuggler and do not have a firm policy when come to fidel|castro in view the policy have fail so congress pass a law the president sign like do a lot of thing but — like welfare reform well be go to sign but be go to try to change next|year mean a lot of these election year conversion the president be talk about all the drug money and all the other thing all this antismoke campaign all happen in and think the people view out there ought to go back and take a look at the record when fight a balanced budget amendment when give that big tax increase in history when try to take over health care system when fight regulatory reform that cost the average family a year this be serious business ’ about family ’s about business and in this case ’s about a firm policy with cuba president clinton there be several off the subject whopper in that litany let just mention senator dole vote for in tax increase runningmate jack|kemp once say that bob|dole never meet a tax do not hike laughter and everybody know include the|wall|street|journal hardly a friend of or this administration that the tax increase sponsor in inflation adjust dollar be the big tax increase in american history so ought to at least get the fact out here on the table so can know where to go from here health care reform lehrer senator dole mention health reform several time what do think should be do about the health care system senator dole let first answer that question about the tax cut know be close loophole be go after big corporation know probably would oppose mr. president but think should have a fair system and a flat system and will have a fair flat system and be go to make the economic package work health care well finally pass the kassebaum bill the president be oppose to in want to give this big system that take over about|one seventh the economy that put on price control create all these state alliance and would cost and force people into manage care whether want or not most people want to see own doctor be go to see own doctor when bob|dole be president will not threaten anybody so pass the kassebaum kennedy bill that will cover about|20|to|25|million people have be for that for or six|year the president hold up and even when finally get near passage senator kennedy hold up for because be not satisfied with provision but will cover a pre - exist condition if change job be go to be cover so there be a lot of good thing in this bill that should have do instead of try this massive massive takeover by the federal government but then of course have a democratic congress and do not want to do that until get a republican congress finally get action and be very proud of colleague in for get that do mean a lot to a lot of people watch tonight president clinton well that sound very good but ’s very wrong senator dole remember well that actually offer not to even put in a health care bill in but instead to work with the senate republicans and write a joint bill and say no because get a memo from of political adviser say that instead should characterize whatever do as big government and make sure nothing be do to aid health care before the election so could make that claim well maybe bite off more than could chew but be pursue a step by step reform now the kennedy kassebaum bill that sign will make possible for people to keep health insurance when change job or when somebody in family have be sick sign a bill to stop these drive by delivery where insurance company can force people out of the hospital after and veto senator dole ’s medicare plan that would have force a lot of senior into manage care and take a lot more money out of pocket and lead to medicare wither on the vine lehrer senator senator dole well many of the provision in the kassebaum bill be provision provision like deduction for long term care make certain that self employ people who be watch tonight can deduct not but of what pay for premium can also deduct long term care now so ’ a good start think we’re even look at tax cut proposal economic package there may be a way there to reach out to the uninsured because there be a lot of uninsured people in this country particularly child that should be cover another way can do be to expand medicaid in america no one will go without health care no one will go without food lehrer senator go ahead and finish sentence sorry senator dole food laughter & nbsp iraq lehrer back to foreign affair for a moment mr. president be satisfied with the way handle this last iraq crisis and the end result president clinton well believe that do the appropriate thing under the circumstance saddam|hussein be under a u.n. resolution not to threaten neighbor or repress own citizen unfortunately a lot of people have never be as concerned about the kurds as the|united|state have try to be and have be fly an operation to protect out of turkey for many|year now what happen be of the kurdish leader invite to go up north but feel since the whole world community have tell not to do that once do have to do something do not feel that could commit — certainly do not feel should commit american troop to throw out of where have go and that be the only way to do that so the appropriate thing strategically to do be to reduce ability to threaten neighbor do that by expand what ’s call the no fly zone by increase ally ’ control of the airspace now from the kuwait border to the suburb of baghdad be the right thing to do believe be be fully effective do make withdraw from the north well have a little bit and hope will continue have learn that if give an inch will take a|mile have to do something and even though not all of ally support at first think most of now believe that what do be an appropriate thing to do lehrer senator dole senator dole well the president ’s own cia director say that saddam be strong now than be and do not understand extend the no fly zone in the south when the trouble be in the north and what have do — during the bush administration the kurds be at the state|department negotiating try to work difference out now have get all thousands|and|thousand of refugee be even ship guess kurds to guam involve turkey ’ a real problem and saddam be probably strong than ever be shoot what cruise missile they’re worth about|$1.2|million apiece and hit some radar that — repair in a couple three|days do inflict any damage no do have any of ally help well have great|britain be always very loyal to and appreciate that and of course kuwait even though have to find out have troop come do not even understand that have to get permission the bottom line be go in there alone be suppose to be operate under a u.n. resolution do without any of ally that help in the gulf president clinton senator dole have time before tonight criticize for work with the u.n. now be be criticize for not work with the u.n. senator dole that ’s not the u.n. president clinton sometimes the|united|state have to act alone or at least have to act first sometimes can not let other country have a veto on foreign policy could not send soldier into the north of iraq that would have be wrong could reduce saddam|hussein ’s ability to threaten kuwait and other neighbor again that ’s what do still believe be the right thing to do & nbsp middle east peace process lehrer senator dole on photo op foreign policy charge against the president senator dole not lehrer no no mean charge against the president that have a photo op foreign policy do the middle|east summit last|week fall into that category senator dole well there be some good picture but do fall into that category do not know want to be very serious have support the president when think be right on bosnia support on nafta and gatt so ’s not that always disagree other disagree with the mideast be very difficult but seem to just as an observer that before would call somebody to america would have some notion what the end result may be now maybe ’s better just to get together and sit down and talk maybe that be the purpose and know talk have—[inaudible]—starte again today but again ’ almost like an foreign policy ’s ’s sort of well get up in the morning and read the paper and what country ’s in trouble will have a meeting to that ’s not the strategy that think that people expect from america think have lose credibility and say this very honestly without any partisanship have lose credibility around the world ally don’t they’re not certain what be go to do what reaction what response be go to be nobody suggest send troop to iraq if that be the hint there from the president but do think that saddam|hussein be strong than be and do believe that do not gain a great deal in the mideast by bring of the leader refuse to come — to president clinton have a very consistent policy in the|middle|east be to support the peace process to support the security of israel and to support those who be prepared to take risk for peace be a very difficult environment the feeling be very strong there be extremist in all part of the|middle|east who want to kill that peace process prime minister rabin give life because someone in own country literally hate for try to bring peace would like to have have a big organized summit but those people be kill each other rapidly innocent arab child innocent israeli people be die so much trust have break down in the aftermath of the change of government feel that if could just get the party together to say let stop the violence start talk commit to the negotiation that would be a plus now today the secretary of state be in the|middle|east and have start negotiation and all of those leader promise would not quit until resolve the issue between and get the peace process go forward again lehrer senator dole senator dole well be disappoint the president do not call for an unconditional end to the violence mean seem to the violence would stop when these leader come to america the killing and the tragedy have take place and ’s unfortunate and be a difficult area no doubt about should not be politicize in any way by the president or by opponent and do not intend to politicize hope that have talk and hope have reach some result and that the killing will end & nbsp vision for the future lehrer mr. president in acceptance speech in chicago say the real choice in this race be quote whether build a bridge to the future or a bridge to the past about whether believe our|best|days be still out there or good day be behind about whether want a country of people all work together or where be on own end quote be say that believe senator dole be a man of the past and if elect president would lead the country backward president clinton well be say that senator dole say in fine speech in that want to build a bridge to the past and think know what mean by that be troubled as be by some of the thing that go on today but believe america be the great country in human history because have maintain freedom and increase prosperity by relentlessly push the barrier of knowledge the barrier of the present always move into the future that ’s why when become president be determined to kind of move beyond this old stale debate that have go on in washington for too long to get this country move again and that ’s why have get a country with more job and record number of new business and rise income and fall crime rate and welfare roll rate that ’s why be move in the right direction and be try to emphasize that what want to do be to continue to do that that ’s why balanced budget plan will still invest and grow this economy that ’s why want a tax cut for education and childrearing but ’s get to be pay for that ’s why want to continue the work have do over partisan opposition to work with community to bring that crime rate down until street be all safe again these be commitment be very oriented toward the future think this election have to be gear toward the future think america ’s best|day be still ahead but have get to build the right bridge senator dole senator dole know the president remind sometimes of brother kenny who be no longer alive but kenny be a great talker and use to tell thing that know be not quite accurate so always have a rule divide by now maybe in case maybe just but new job and everything mean the president can not take credit for everything that governors be do or that ’s happen in new|york|city when come to the murder rate and then not be responsible for the bad thing that happen whether ’s drug use or something else in america and so seem to that can talk about — well call kenny the great exaggerator because just like to make sound a little well make feel well when come to bridge want a bridge to the future also want a bridge to the truth have to tell the truth have get people watch tonight and listen tonight try to find the truth and the truth be there ’s a lot wrong with america need a strong economic package need a tax cut need the child credit and will have that soon lehrer mr. president president clinton do not for a moment think be entitled to all the credit for the good thing that have happen in america but where have move to work with the american people to help have the tool to make the most of own life think should get some credit for that also personally take responsibility tonight when senator dole ask about the drug problem but know think idea be well for the future senator dole vote against student loan against head start against create the|department|of|education if get elect president will start the|new|century without anyone in the cabinet of the president represent education and child personally do not think that ’s the right kind of future for america and think ought to take a different tack & nbsp education lehrer senator dole do still favor eliminate the|department|of|education senator dole yes do not favor when be start vote against be a tribute after president carter ’s election to the|national|education|association who send a lot of delegate to the|democratic|convention who give of money to democrats and the president and a lot of the teacher send kid to private school or well public school so what want to do be call opportunity scholarship now some say oh be republican can not be reach out to these people have reach out to people all life have work on the food stamp program proudly and the wic program and the school lunch program with senator like george|mcgovern hubert|humphrey and other to name a few of democratic friend be not some extremist out here care about people have own little foundation that ’s raise about|$10|million for the disabled do not advertise just do have not before try to do a lot of thing that think may be helpful to people so seem to that ought to take that money can save from the|department|of|education put into opportunity scholarship and tell little landel|shakespeare out in cleveland ohio and tell mother and father be go to get to go to school because be go to match what the state put up and be go to get to go to the school of choice do not fault the president or the vice president for send child to private school or well school applaud for do not criticize but why should not everybody have that choice why should not low income americans and low middle income americans be excite about ’s go to be a big big opportunity for a lot of people president clinton let say first of all be all for student have more choice have work hard to expand public school choice in balanced budget bill there be fund for new school create by teacher and parent sometimes by business people call charter school that have no rule be free of bureaucracy and can only stay in existence if perform and teach child the one that be out there be do well what be against be senator dole ’s plan to take money away from all of the child now help with limited federal fund and help far few if be go to have a private voucher plan that ought to be do at the local level or the state level but senator dole have consistently oppose federal help to education vote against student loan vote against improved student loan plan vote against the national service bill against the head start bill vote against effort in safe and drug free school have vote against these program do not believe that ’s the issue of kid be out there in those public school and need to lift standard and move forward with the program like those have outline in this campaign senator dole have better correct the president do not know what time be but ’s probably get late but want to correct — all of these thing vote against be probably part of some big package that have a lot of pork in or a lot of thing that should not have have and probably vote no have support all of the education program have support head start think ought to look at so do not want anybody out there to think that have just be vote no no no let give low income parent the same right that people of power and prestige have in america and let go to well school let turn the school back to the teacher and back to the parent and take away from the|national|education|association lehrer mr. president what ’s wrong with the school choice proposal president clinton support school choice support school choice have advocate expansion of public school choice alternative and say the creation of new school that be go to help the states to finance but if be go to have a private voucher plan that ought to be determine by state and locality where be raise and spend most of the money simply think ’ wrong to take money away from program that be help build basic skill for kids—90|percent of be in the public school to take money away from program that be help fund the school lunch program that be help to fund the other program that be help school to improve standard school be get well and school can be make to be even better still with the right kind of community leadership and partnership at the school level have be a strong force for reform and senator remind that a|few|years|ago when support a teacher testing law in home state be pretty well lambaste by the teacher association just do not believe ought to be out there run down teacher and attack the way do at the|republican|convention think ought to be lift up and move child forward and let just say that budget pass that veto would have cut kid out of head start would have eliminate the americorps plan and would have cut back on student loan and scholarship now would have that ’s a fact that ’s of the big reason veto need to be do more in education not less senator dole well the americorps program must say if that ’s of success would not speak about too loudly ’s cost about|$27,000 to pay people to volunteer have get four|million young people volunteer every year the number have not go down and pick out whether need the money or not and get pay for volunteer like young people like teacher be a product of public school attend a private school for some time in life like teacher be not for school choice can not be for school choice because ’s that special interest money again when be get of the money do not know what happen to the other percent be look for somebody get but all go to democrats and this be part of that liberal establishment of those liberal thing that just can not do be for school uniform and curfew and be oppose to truancy now that ’s not reform mr. president why can not landel|shakespeare in cleveland or pilar|gonzalez in milwaukee give child an opportunity to go to a well school some school be not safe some school be not even safe choice be nothing let give a real choice the kind of choice have and the kind of choice a lot of people have in america if want to stop crime and teenage pregnancy let start with education president clinton first of all senator dole let set the record straight be able for two|year when be a very young boy to go to a catholic school but basically go to public school all life and have work hard for a long time to make well ninety|percent of kid be there ’ amazing to be all for have more responsibility at the local level for everything except school where do not have very much money at the federal level to spend on education ought to spend help of the kid that can help if a local school district in cleveland or anyplace else want to have a private school choice plan like milwaukee do let have at may say the result be highly ambiguous but want to get out there and give a well education opportunity to all of child and that ’s why veto the budget that pass with in education cut be wrong and plan for the future be well political philosophy lehrer mr. president senator dole at the|republican|convention say the following and quote be demean to the nation that within the clinton administration a corps of the elite who never grow up never do anything real never sacrifice never suffer and never learn should have the power to fund with earning dubious and self serve scheme end quote whom precisely and what precisely do have in mind senator dole have precisely in mind a lot of the people that be in the|white|house and other agency who have never be have any experience who come to washington without any experience be all very liberal of course or would not be in the administration and idea be that know what be good for the american people now feel very strongly about a lot of thing feel strongly about education want to help young people have an education just as have an education after world|war|ii with the gi bill of right and have have million of young man and woman in subsequent war change the face of the nation because the government help with education now the reason do not want to have know the reason the president can not support this be pretty obvious ’s not take anything away from school ’ new money ’s not go to be take away from anybody else except will downsize the|department|of|education but this be a very liberal administration this be the administration that give the big tax cut this be the administration that try to take over health care and impose a governmental system this be the administration that fight regulatory reform and that ’s put a lot of small business man and small business woman out of business this be the administration that fight the balanced budget amendment and veto a balanced budget and veto welfare reform twice and the list go on and on and on that ’s what have in mind want people in administration and will have people in administration who understand america there will not be millionaire and lawyer in the cabinet will be people with experience and people who understand america and people who know the hard knock in life president clinton when senator dole make that remark about all the elitist young elitist in the administration of the young man who work for who grow up in a house trailer look at and say mr. president know how grow up who be talk about and know this liberal charge that ’s what party always drag out when get in a tight race ’s sort of golden oldie know ’ a record think can play that everybody love to hear laughter and just do not think that dog will hunt this time the american people should make up own mind here ’s the record cut the deficit four|years|in|a|row for the first time since before the|civil|war mean before world|war|ii and maybe before the|civil|war too laughter have get new job have get record number of new small business make every of eligible for a tax cut have get decline crime rate two|million few people on welfare roll before welfare reform pass and a increase in child support and a crime bill with death penalty police and the assault weapon ban the american people can make up mind about whether that ’s a liberal record or a record that ’s good for america liberal conservative put whatever label want on senator dole well think ’s pretty liberal will put that label on when take a look at all the program have advocate mr. president thank goodness have a republican congress there the first thing do when come into office be send up a stimulus package that say have get a little pork want to scatter around america and even some in own party could not buy that remember talk by the telephone i’m not even certain be too excited about i’ll never repeat what talk with the president about but in any event save the taxpayer and then come some other program and then come health care and then come the tax increase and a lot of these thing just stop in because then the congress change and think have do a good job lehrer mr. president if be not a liberal describe political philosophy president clinton believe that the purpose of politic be to give people the tool to make the most of own life to reinforce the value of opportunity and responsibility and to build a sense of community so be all work together do not believe in discrimination believe can protect the environment and grow the economy believe that have to do these thing with a government that ’s small and less bureaucratic but that have to do nonetheless ’s inconvenient for senator dole but the truth be have reduce the size of government more than republican predecessor and do stop admit that sure stop budget budget cut enforcement for the|environmental|protection|agency by a third cut fund to clean up toxic waste dump with of kid still live within four|mile of a toxic waste dump by a third end the principle of the polluter should pay for those toxic waste dump unless be very recent budget weaken support for education even cut fund for scholarship and college loan budget cut in medicare and finally budget withdraw the national guarantee of health care to poor child family with child with handicap the elderly in nursing home poor pregnant woman be wrong for the country and call conservative will not make right be a bad decision for america and would have be bad for future if have not stop senator dole well the president can define in any way want but think have to look at the record go back to the time be what texas director for george|mcgovern george|mcgovern be a friend of mine so do not mean — but be a liberal proud liberal have just finish read a book think ’s call what be the demise of by ronald|radosh or something talk about all the liberal influence in the administration whether ’s organize labor or whether ’s the hollywood elite or whether ’s some of the medium elite or whether ’s the labor union or whatever and so think take a look at but the bottom line be this think the american people probably lose sight of all of these bill and all these thing want to know what ’s go to happen to have all get a lot of anxiety out there do anybody complain when raise taxis do anybody go out and ask the people how be go to pay the extra money that ’s why want an economic package want the government to pinch penny for a change instead of the people pinch penny that ’s what message be to people watch not all this back and forth — vote this way vote that way want a well america as go into the|next|century president clinton the way to get a well america be to balance the budget and protect medicare medicaid education and the environment to give a target tax cut and let talk about the education tax cut to let people have a deduction for the cost of college tuition in any|year any kind of college tuition to give family a tax credit a dollar for dollar reduction in taxis for the cost of a typical community college so can open that to everybody and then to let people save in an ira and withdraw from without a tax penalty for education homebuying or medical expense that ’s the right way to go into the|21st|century balance the budget and cut taxis not balloon with this tax scheme personal differences lehrer senator dole have talk mostly now about difference between the of that relate to policy issue and that sort of thing be there also significant difference in the more personal area that be relevant to this election senator dole let say first on the president ’s promise for another tax cut mean have tell people as travel around all of who get the tax cut promise last time vote for in and not many hand go up so the question be would buy a use election promise from opponent the people want economic reform be have a hard time make end meet get parent work for the government the other parent work for the family and this be important business this be about get the economy move again this be about american job and opportunity ’ about the government as say before pinch penny for a change instead of the poor taxpayer when raise taxis nobody run around ask people where be go to get the extra money think the government can do better lehrer be there personal difference that be relevant to this senator dole well blood pressure be low and weight cholesterol but will not make health an issue in this campaign laughter think ’s a bit tall than be but think there be personal difference mean do not like to get into personal matter as far as be concern this be a campaign about issue ’ about vision for america and about liberal vision for america and not about personal thing and think liberal vision be a thing of the past know want to disown would not want to be a liberal either mr. president but be stick with because that ’s record ’ record in

education pro - economic growth now opponent have put forward a very different plan a risky tax scheme that will force to ask for even big cut in medicare medicaid education and the environment than pass and veto last|year but even then will not cover the cost of scheme so that even then this plan will explode the deficit which will increase interest rate by two|percent accord to own estimate last|year will require huge cut in the very investment need to grow and to grow together and at the same time slow down the economy know what high interest rate mean to mean a high mortgage payment a

pat|byron thank mark|klaas and thank and especially john|walsh thank for spend all of these|year to bring these issue to america 's attention thank sir would also like to say a special word of thank to the person who do more than any other person in the|united|state to talk through all the legal and practical matter that have to be resolve in order for the president to advocate amend constitution former prosecutor and a former colleague of mine governor bob|miller of nevada thank sir for work here for year have work to make criminal justice system more effective more fair more even handed more vigilant in the protection of the innocent today the system bend over backwards to protect those who may be innocent and that be as should be but too often ignore the|millions|and|million of people who be completely innocent because be victim and that be wrong that be what be try to correct today when someone be a victim or should be at the center of the criminal justice process not on the outside look in participation in all form of government be the essence of democracy victim should be guarantee the right to participate in proceeding relate to crime commit against people accuse of crime have explicit constitutional right ordinary citizen have a constitutional right to participate in criminal trial by serve on a jury the press have a constitutional right to attend trial all of this be as should be be only the victim of crime who have no constitutional right to participate and that be not the way should be have carefully study all the alternative be now convinced that the only way to fully safeguard the right of victim in america be to amend constitution and guarantee these basic right to be tell about public court proceeding and to attend to make a statement to the court about bail about sentencing about accept a plea if the victim be present to be tell about parole hearing to attend and to speak notice when the defendant or convict escape or be release restitution from the defendant reasonable protection from the defendant and notice of these right if have ever be a victim of a violent crime probably would not even occur to that these right could be deny if have never be a victim but actually happen time and time again happen in spite of the fact that the victim ' right movement in america have be an active force for about|20|year now the wife of a murder state trooper in maryland be leave cry outside the courtroom for the entire trial of husband 's killer because the defense subpoena as a witness just to keep out and never even call a rape victim in florida be not notify when rapist be release on parole find and kill last|year in new|jersey old jakiyah|mcclain be sexually assault and brutally murder have go to visit a friend and never come home police find in the closet of an abandon apartment now mother want to use a new|jersey law that give the murder victim ' survivor the right to address a jury decide on the death penalty want the jury to know more about this fine young girl than the crime scene report want to know that jakiyah be accept into a school for gifted child before die but a new|jersey judge decide can not testify even though the state law give the right to do so rule that the defendant 's constitutional right to a fair trial require to strike the law down well jakiyah 's mother have the courage to overcome pain to be with today have to change this for and for other victim in america thank and god bless the only way to give victim equal and due consideration be to amend the constitution for nearly|20|year have be involve in the fight for victim ' right since be attorney general in home state pass law then to guarantee victim ' right to attend trial and to get restitution and later to get notice and to participate in parole hearing over all those year learn what every victim of crime know too well as long as the right of the accuse be protect but the right of victim be not time and again the victim will lose when a judge balance defendant ' right in the|federal|constitution against victim ' right in a statute or a state constitution the defendant ' right almost always prevail that be just how the law work today want to level the playing field this be not about deprive people accuse of crime of legitimate right include the presumption of innocence this be about simple fairness when a judge balance the right of the accuse and the right of the victim want the right of the victim to get equal weight when a plea bargain be enter in public a criminal be sentence a defendant be let out on bail the victim ought to know about and ought to have a say want to work with the congressional leadership the house and senate judiciary committees include senators|kyl and feinstein and chairman hyde and law enforcement official to craft the good possible amendment should guarantee victim ' right in every court in the land federal state juvenile and military should be self execute so that take effect as soon as be ratified without additional legislation congress will take responsibility to enforce victim ' right in federal court and the states will keep responsibility to enforce in state court but need the amendment also want to say just before go forward again want to thank senators|kyl and feinstein and the other who have approach this in a totally bipartisan manner this be a cause for all americans when people be victimize the criminal almost never ask before be rob or beat or rap or murder be a republican or a democrat this be a matter of national security just as much as the national security issue beyond border on which try to achieve a bipartisan consensus and applaud the nonpolitical and patriotic way in which this manner have be approach in the congress just like be approach every|day in the country and ought to do good to keep that way know that there can be with any good effort unforeseen consequence think know what would likely be and believe know how to guard against certainly do not want to make harder for prosecutor to convict violent criminal sure do not want to give criminal like gang member who may be victim of associate any way to take advantage of these right just to slow the criminal justice process down want to protect victim not accidentally help criminal but can solve these problem the problem be not an excuse for inaction still have to go forward of course amend the constitution can take a long time may take year and while work to amend must do everything in power to enhance the protection of victim ' right now today be direct the attorney general to hold the federal system to a high standard than ever before to guarantee maximum participation by victim under exist law and to review exist legislation to see what further change ought to make will give an example there ought to be believe in every law federal|and|state a protection for victim who participate in the criminal justice process not to be discriminate against on the job because have to take time off that protection today be accord to jury member certainly ought to extend to people who be victim who need to be in the criminal justice process and should not wait for that kind of thing to be do want investigator and prosecutor to take the strong step to include victim want work to begin immediately to launch a computerized system so victim get information about new development in a case in change in the status or the location of a defendant or a convict do not support amend the constitution lightly be sacred should be change only with great caution and after much consideration but reject the idea that should never be change change lightly and risk distinction but never change and risk vitality have support the goal of many constitutional amendment since take office but in each amendment that have be propose during tenure as president have oppose the amendment either because be not appropriate or not necessary but this be different want to balance the budget for example but the constitution already give the power to do that what need be the will and to work together to do that want young people to be able to express religious conviction in an appropriate manner wherever be even in a school but the constitution protect people 's right to express faith but this be different this be not an attempt to put legislative responsibility in the constitution or to guarantee a right that be already guarantee amend the constitution here be simply the only way to guarantee that victim ' right be weight equally with defendant ' right in every courtroom in america two|hundred|twenty|years|ago founding father be concern justifiably that government never never trample on the right of people just because be accuse of a crime today be time for to make sure that while continue to protect the right of the accuse government do not trample on the right of the victim until these right be also enshrine in constitution the people who have be hurt most by crime will continue to be deny equal justice under law that be what this country be really all about equal justice under law and crime

of peace between those who be in the ship of peace and those who be try to sink old habit die hard there will always be those who define the worth of life not by who be but by who be not not by what be for but by what be against will never escape the dead end street of violence but the vast majority protestant|and|catholic alike must not allow the ship of peace to sink on the rock of old habit and hard grudge must stand firm against terror must say to those who still would use violence for political objective be the past day be over violence have no place at the table of democracy and no role in the future of this land by the same token must also be willing to say to those who renounce violence and who do take own risk for peace that be entitle to be full participant in the democratic

unparalleled prosperity and that bring victory in the cold war today because of dedication america 's ideal liberty democracy and peace be more and more the aspiration of people everywhere in the world be the power of idea even more than size wealth and military might that make america a uniquely trust nation with the cold war over some people now question the need for continue active leadership in the world believe that much like after world|war|i america can now step back from the responsibility of leadership argue that to be secure need only to keep own border safe and that the time have come now to leave to other the hard work of leadership beyond border strongly disagree as the cold war give way to the global village leadership be need more than ever because problem that start beyond border can quickly become problem within be all vulnerable to the organized force of intolerance and destruction terrorism ethnic religious and regional rivalry the spread of organize crime and weapon of mass destruction and drug trafficking just as surely as fascism and communism these force also threaten freedom and democracy peace and prosperity and too demand american leadership but nowhere have the argument for leadership be more clearly justified than in the struggle to stop or prevent war and civil violence from iraq to haiti from south|africa to korea from the|middle|east to northern|ireland have stand up for peace and freedom because be in interest to do so and because be the right thing to do now that do not mean can solve every problem duty as president be to match the demand for american leadership to strategic interest and to ability to make a difference america can not and must not be the world 's policeman can not stop all war for all time but can stop some war can not save all woman and all child but can save many of can not do everything but must do what can there be time and place where leadership can mean the difference between peace and war and where can defend fundamental value as a people and serve most basic strategic interest fellow americans in this new era there be still time when america and america alone can and should make the difference for peace the terrible war in bosnia be such a case nowhere today be the need for american leadership more stark or more immediate than in bosnia for nearly|4|year a terrible war have tear bosnia apart horror pray have be banish from europe forever have be sear into mind again skeletal prisoner cage behind barbed wire fence woman and girl rap as a tool of war defenseless man and boy shoot down into mass grave evoke vision of world|war|ii concentration camp and endless line of refugee march toward a future of despair when take office some be urge immediate intervention in the conflict decide that american ground troop should not fight a war in bosnia because the|united|state could not force peace on bosnia 's war ethnic group the serbs croats and muslims instead america have work with european ally in search for peace stop the war from spread and ease the suffering of the bosnian people impose tough economic sanction on serbia use air power to conduct the long humanitarian airlift in history and to enforce a no fly zone that take the war out of the sky help to make peace between of the war party the muslims and the croats but as the month of war turn into year become clear that europe alone could not end the conflict this|summer bosnian|serb shell once again turn bosnia 's playground and marketplace into kill field in response the|united|state lead nato 's heavy and continuous air strike many of fly by skilled and brave american pilot those air strike together with the renew determination of european partner and the bosnian and croat gain on the battlefield convince the serbs finally to start think about make peace at the same time the|united|state initiate an intensive diplomatic effort that forge a bosnia wide cease fire and get the party to agree to the basic principle of peace dedicated american diplomat bob|frasure joe|kruzel and nelson|drew lose life in that effort tonight remember sacrifice and that of family and will never forget exceptional service to nation finally just|3|weeks|ago the muslims croats and serbs come to dayton ohio in america 's heartland to negotiate a settlement there exhaust by war make a commitment to peace agree to put down gun to preserve bosnia as a single state to investigate and prosecute war criminal to protect the human right of all citizen to try to build a peaceful democratic future and ask for america 's help as implement this peace agreement america have a responsibility to answer that request to help to turn this moment of hope into an endure reality to do that troop from country and around the world would go into bosnia to give the confidence and support need to implement peace plan refuse to send american troop to fight a war in bosnia but believe must help to secure the bosnian peace want to know tonight what be at stake exactly what troop will be ask to accomplish and why must carry out responsibility to help implement the peace agreement implement the agreement in bosnia can end the terrible suffering of the people the warfare the mass execution the ethnic cleansing the campaign of rape and terror let never forget a|quarter|of|a|million man woman and child have be shell shoot and torture to death two|million people half of the population be force from home and into a miserable life as refugee and these faceless number hide million of real personal tragedy for each of the war 's victim be a mother or daughter a father or son a brother or sister now the war be over american leadership create the chance to build a peace and stop the suffering secure peace in bosnia will also help to build a free and stable europe bosnia lie at the very heart of europe next door to many of fragile new democracy and some of close ally generation of americans have understand that europe 's freedom and europe 's stability be vital to own national security that be why fight war in europe that be why launch the|marshall|plan to restore europe that be why create nato and wag the cold war and that be why must help the nation of europe to end bad nightmare since world|war|ii now the only force capable of get this job do be nato the powerful military alliance of democracy that have guarantee security for half|a|century now and as nato 's leader and the primary broker of the peace agreement the|united|states must be an essential part of the mission if be not there nato will not be there the peace will collapse the war will reignite the slaughter of innocent will begin again a conflict that already have claim so many victim could spread like poison throughout the region eat away at europe 's stability and erode partnership with european ally and america 's commitment to leadership will be question if refuse to participate in implement a peace agreement broker right here in the|united|state especially since the president of bosnia croatia and serbia all ask to participate and all pledge good effort to the security of troop when america 's partnership be weak and leadership be in doubt undermine ability to secure interest and to convince other to work with if do maintain partnership and leadership need not act alone as see in the|gulf|war and in haiti many other nation who share goal will also share burden but when america do not lead the consequence can be very grave not only for other but eventually for as well as speak to nato be complete planning for ifor an international force for peace in bosnia of about|60,000 troop already more|than|25 other nation include major nato ally have pledge to take part will contribute about|two third of the total implementation force some|40,000 troop the|united|state would contribute the rest about|20,000 soldier the final nato plan will be submit to for review and approval let make clear what expect to include and what must include for to give final approval to the participation of armed|force first the mission will be precisely define with clear realistic goal that can be achieve in a definite period of time troop will make sure that each side withdraw force behind the frontline and keep there will maintain the cease fire to prevent the war from accidentally start again these effort in turn will help to create a secure environment so that the people of bosnia can return to home vote in free election and begin to rebuild life joint|chiefs|of|staff have conclude that this mission should and will take about|one|year second the risk to troop will be minimize american troop will take order from the american general who command nato will be heavily armed and thoroughly train by make an overwhelming show of force will lessen the need to use force but unlike the u.n. force will have the authority to respond immediately and the training and the equipment to respond with overwhelming force to any threat to own safety or any violation of the military provision of the peace agreement if the nato plan meet with approval will immediately send to congress and request support will also authorize the participation of a small number of american troop in a nato advance mission that will lay the groundwork for ifor start sometime next|week will establish headquarters and set up the sophisticated communication system that must be in place before nato can send in troop tank and truck to bosnia the implementation force would begin deploy in bosnia in the|days follow the formal signature of the peace agreement in mid - december the international community will help to implement arm control provision of the agreement so that future hostility be less likely and armament be limit while the world community the|united|state and other will also make sure that the|bosnian|federation have the mean to defend once ifor withdraw ifor will not be a part of this effort civilian agency from around the world will begin a separate program of humanitarian relief and reconstruction principally pay for by european ally and other interested country this effort be also absolutely essential to make the peace endure will bring the people of bosnia the food shelter clothing and medicine so many have be deny for so long will help to rebuild — to rebuild road and school power plant and hospital factory and shop will reunite child with parent and family with home will allow the bosnians freely to choose own leader will give all the people of bosnia a much great stake in peace than war so that peace take on a life and a logic of own in bosnia can and will succeed because mission be clear and limited and troop be strong and very well prepared but fellow americans no deployment of american troop be risk free and this one may well involve casualty there may be accident in the field or incident with people who have not give up hatred will take every measure possible to minimize these risk but must be prepare for that possibility as president most difficult duty be to put the man and woman who volunteer to serve nation in harm 's way when interest and value demand assume full responsibility for any harm that may come to but anyone contemplate any action that would endanger troop should know this america protect own anyone anyone who take on troop will suffer the consequence will fight fire with fire and then some after so much bloodshed and loss after so many outrageous act of inhuman brutality will take an extraordinary effort of will for the people of bosnia to pull from past and start build a future of peace but with leadership and the commitment of ally the people of bosnia can have the chance to decide future in peace have a chance to remind the world that just a|few|short|years|ago the mosque and church of sarajevo be a shin symbol of multiethnic tolerance that bosnia once find unity in diversity indeed the cemetery in the center of the city be just a|few|short|years|ago a magnificent stadium which host the olympics universal symbol of peace and harmony bosnia can be that kind of place again must not turn back on bosnia now and so ask all americans and ask every member of congress democrat and republican alike to make the choice for peace in the choice between peace and war america must choose peace fellow americans ask to think just for a moment about this century that be draw to close and the new one that will soon begin because previous

the americorps button on that gentleman 's shirt be remind as talk about this thorny subject of race today be remind of what winston|churchill say about the|united|state when president roosevelt be try to pass the|lend lease|act so that could help britain in war against nazi germany before be involve and for a good while the issue be hang fire and be unclear whether the congress would permit to help britain who at that time be the only bulwark against tyranny in europe and winston|churchill say have great confidence in the judgment and the common sense of the american people and leader invariably do the right thing after have examine every other alternative laughter so say to let begin by say that can see in the eye of these student and in the spirit of this moment will do the right thing in recent|weeks every of have be make aware of a simple truth white|american and black americans often see the same world in drastically different way way that go beyond and beneath the simpson trial and aftermath which bring these perception so starkly into the open the rift see before that be tear at the heart of america exist in spite of the remarkable progress black americans have make in the last generation since martin|luther king sweep america up in dream and president johnson speak so powerfully for the dignity of man and the destiny of democracy in demand that congress guarantee full voting right to black the rift between black and white exist still in a very special way in america in spite of the fact that have become much more racially and ethnically diverse and that hispanic americans no stranger to discrimination be now almost|10|percent of national population the reason for this divide be many some be root in the awful history and stubborn persistence of racism some be root in the different way experience the threat of modern life to personal security family value and strong community some be root in the fact that still have not learn to talk frankly to listen carefully and to work together across racial line almost|30|years|ago dr. martin|luther|king take last march with sanitation worker in memphis march for dignity equality and economic justice many carry placard that read simply be a man the throng of man march in washington today almost all of be do so for the same state reason but there be a profound difference between this march today and those of thirty|years|ago the marcher be demand the dignity and opportunity be due because in the face of terrible discrimination have work hard raise child pay taxis obey the law and fight war well today 's march be also about pride and dignity and respect but after a generation of deepen social problem that disproportionately impact black americans be also about black man take renew responsibility for family and community be about say no to crime and drug and violence be about stand up for atonement and reconciliation be about insist that other do the same and offering to help be about the frank admission that unless black man shoulder load no one else can help or brother sister and child escape the hard bleak life that too many of still face of course some of those in the march do have a history that be far from message of atonement and reconciliation one|million man be right to be stand up for personal responsibility but one|million man do not make right man 's message of malice and division no good house be ever build on a bad foundation nothing good ever come of hate so let pray today that all who march and all who speak will stand for atonement for reconciliation for responsibility let pray that those who have speak for hatred and division in the past will turn away from that past and give voice to the true message of those ordinary americans who march if that happen the man and the woman who be there with will be march into well life for and family and could be march into a well future for america today face a choice way lead to further separation and bitterness and more lose future the other way the path of courage and wisdom lead to unity to reconciliation to a rich opportunity for all americans to make the most of the life god give this moment in which the racial divide be so clearly out in the open need not be a setback for present with a great opportunity and dare not let pass by in the past when have have the courage to face the truth about failure to live up to own good ideal have grow strong move forward and restore proud american optimism at such turning point america move to preserve the union and abolish slavery to embrace woman 's suffrage to guarantee basic legal right to america without regard to race under the leadership of president johnson at each of these moment look in the national mirror and be brave enough to say this be not who be be well than that abraham|lincoln remind that a house divide against can not stand when division have threaten to bring house down somehow have always move together to shore up fellow americans house be the great democracy in all human history and with all racial and ethnic diversity have beat the odd of human history but know that division remain and still have work to do the world see now each contain both truth and distortion both black and white americans must face this for honesty be the only gateway to the many act of reconciliation that will unite world at last into america white|america must understand and acknowledge the root of black pain begin with unequal treatment first in law and later in fact african americans indeed have live too long with a justice system that in too many case have be and continue to be less than just the record of abuse extend from lynching and trump up charge to false arrest and police brutality the tragedy of emmett|till and rodney|king be bloody marker on the very same road still today too many of police officer play by the rule of the|bad|old|day be beyond wrong when law abide black parent have to tell law abide child to fear the police whose salary be pay by own taxis and black be right to think something be terribly wrong when african american man be many time more likely to be victim of homicide than any other group in this country when there be more african american man in correction system than in college when almost|one in african american man in 's be either in jail on parole or otherwise under the supervision of the criminal justice system nearly|one in and that be a disproportionate percentage in comparison to the percentage of black who use drug in society now would like every white person here and in america to take a moment to think how or would feel if in white man be in similar circumstance and there be still unacceptable economic disparity between black and white be so fashionable to talk today about african americans as if have be some sort of protect class many white think black be get more than fair share in term of job and promotion that be not true that be not true the truth be that african americans still make on average about|60|percent of what white people do that more|than|half of african american child live in poverty and at the very time young americans need access to college more than ever before black college enrollment be drop in america on the other hand black must understand and acknowledge the root of white fear in america there be a legitimate fear of the violence that be too prevalent in urban area and often by experience or at least what people see on the news at night violence for those white people too often have a black face be not racist for a parent to pull or child close when walk through a high crime neighborhood or to wish to stay away from neighborhood where innocent child can be shoot in school or standing at bus stop by thug drive by with assault weapon or tote handgun like old west desperado be not racist for parent to recoil in disgust when read about a national survey of gang member say that third of feel justified in shoot someone simply for show disrespect be not racist for white to say do not understand why people put up with gang on the corner or in the project or with drug be sell in the school or in the open be not racist for white to assert that the culture of welfare dependency out of wedlock pregnancy and absent fatherhood can not be break by social program unless there be first more personal responsibility the great potential for this march today beyond the black community be that white will come to see a large truth that black share fear and embrace conviction openly assert that without change in the black community and within individual real change for society will not come this march could remind white people that most black people share old fashioned american value for most black americans still do work hard care for family pay taxis and obey the law often under circumstance which be far more difficult than those white counterpart face imagine how would feel if be a young parent in 's with a young child live in a housing project work somewhere for an hour with no health insurance pass every day people on the street sell drug make time what make those people be the real hero of america today and should recognize that and white people too often forget that be not immune to the problem black americans face crime drug domestic abuse and teen pregnancy be too prevalent among white as well and some of those problem be grow faster in white population than in minority population so all have a stake in solve these common problem together be therefore wrong for white americans to do what have do too often simply to move further away from the problem and support policy that will only make bad finally both side seem to fear deep down inside that will never quite be able to see each other as more than enemy face all of whom carry at least a sliver of bigotry in heart difference of opinion root in different experience be healthy indeed essential for democracy but difference so great and so root in race threaten to divide the house mr. lincoln give life to save as dr. king say must learn to live together as brother or will perish as fool recognize one another be real grievance be only the first step must all take responsibility for conduct and attitude america must clean house of racism to white citizen say know most of every day do very good by own light to live a life free of discrimination nevertheless too many destructive idea be gain currency in midst the tap voice of policeman should fill with outrage and so say must clean the house of white america of racism americans who be in the white majority should be proud to stand up and be hear denounce the sort of racist rhetoric hear on that tape so loudly and clearly denounce that black fellow citizen can hear white racism may be black people 's burden but be white people 's problem must clean house to black citizen honor the presence of hundreds|of|thousands of man in washington today commit to atonement and to personal responsibility and the commitment of million of other man and woman who be african americans to this cause call upon to build on this effort to share equally in the promise of america but to do that house too must be clean of racism there be too many today white and black on the left and the right on the street corner and the radio wave who seek to sow division for own purpose to say no more must be long before be so diverse nation 's motto be e pluribus unum out of many be must be as neighbor as fellow citizen not separate camp but family white black latino all of no matter how different who share basic american value and be willing to live by when a child be gun down on a street in the bronx no matter what race be american child when a woman die from a beating no matter what race or her be american sister and every time drug course through the vein of another child cloud the future of all american child whether like or not be nation family indivisible and for divorce or separation be not option here in on the edge of the|21st|century dare not tolerate the existence of americas under watch will do everything can to see that as soon as possible there be only|one america under the rule of law social contract commit not to winner take all but to give all americans a chance to win together america well how do get there first today ask every governor every mayor every business leader every church leader every civic leader every union steward every student leader most important every citizen in every workplace and learn place and meeting place all across america to take personal responsibility for reach out to people of different race for take time to sit down and talk through this issue to have the courage to speak honestly and frankly and then to have the discipline to listen quietly with an open mind and an open heart as other do the same this may seem like a simple request but for tens|of|million of americans this have never be a reality have never speak and have never listen not really not really be convince base on a rich lifetime of friendship and common endeavor with people of different race that the american people will find out have a lot more in common than think do the second thing have to do be to defend and enhance real opportunity be not talk about opportunity for black americans or opportunity for white americans be talk about opportunity for all americans sooner or later all speaking all listening all caring have to lead to constructive action together for word and intention to have meaning can do this first by truly rewarding work and family in government policy in employment policy in community practice also have to realize that there be some area of country whether in urban area or poor rural area like south texas or eastern arkansas where these problem be go to be more prevalent just because there be no opportunity there be only so much temptation some people can stand when turn up against a brick wall|day|after|day|after|day and if can spread the benefit of education and free enterprise to those who have be deny too long and who be isolate in enclave in this country then have a moral obligation to do will be good for country third and perhaps most important of all have to give every child in this country and every adult who still need the opportunity to get a good education president johnson understand that and now that be privileged to have this job and to look back across the whole sweep of american history can appreciate how truly historic commitment to the simple idea that every child in this country ought to have an opportunity to get a good safe decent fulfil education be be revolutionary then and be revolutionary today today that matter more than ever be try to do part be fight hard against effort to roll back family security aid to distressed community and support for education want to be easy for poor child to get off to a good start in school not hard want to be easy for everybody to go to college and stay there not hard want to mend affirmative action but do not think america be at a place today where can end the evidence of the|last|several|weeks show that but let remember the people march in washington today be right about fundamental thing at base this issue of race be not about government or political leader be about what be in the heart and mind and life of the american people there will be no progress in the absence of real responsibility on the part of all americans nowhere be that responsibility more important than in effort to promote public safety and preserve the rule of law law and order be the first responsibility of government citizen must respect the law and those who enforce police have a life and death responsibility never never to abuse the power grant by the people know by the way what work in fight crime also happen to improve relationship between the race what work in fight crime be community policing have see work all across america the crime rate be down the murder rate be down where people relate to each other across the line of police and community in an open honest respectful supportive way can lower crime and raise the state of race relation in america if will remember this simple truth but if this be go to work police department have to be fair and engage with not estrange from community be commit to make this kind of community police a reality all across country but must be commit to make a reality in community have to root out the remnant of racism in police department have get to get out of entire criminal justice system but just as the police have a sacred duty to protect the community fairly all of citizen have a sacred responsibility to respect the police to teach young people to respect and then to support and work with so that can succeed in make safe let not forget most police officer of whatever race be honest people who love the law and put life on the line so that the citizen be protect can lead decent secure life and so that child can grow up to do the same finally want to say on a moment about a crucial area of responsibility the responsibility of fatherhood the single big social problem in society may be the grow absence of father from child 's home because contribute to so many other social problem child in grow up in a fatherless home without a father to help guide without a father to care without a father to teach boy to be man and to teach girl to expect respect from man be hard there be a lot of mother out there do a magnificent job alone a magnificent job alone but be hard be hard this of course be not a black problem or a latino problem or a white problem be an american problem but aggravate the condition of the racial divide know from own life be hard because own father die before be bear and stepfather 's battle with alcohol keep from be the father may have be but for all father parenting be not easy and every parent make mistake know that too from own experience the point be that need people to be there for child day after day build a family be the hard job a man can do but be also the most important for those who be neglect child say be not too late child still need to those who only send money in the form of child support say keep send the check kid count on and will catch and enforce the law if stop but the message of this march today message be that money be no replacement for guiding caring love the child bring into this world can only build strong family when man and woman respect each other when have partnership when man be as involved in the homeplace as woman have become involved in the workplace mean among other thing that must keep work until end domestic violence against woman and child hope those man in washington today pledge among other thing to never never raise hand in violence against a woman so today fellow americans honor the black man march in washington to demonstrate commitment to family and community honor the million of man and woman in america the vast majority of every color who without fanfare or recognition do what take to be good father and good mother good worker and good citizen all deserve the thank of america but when leave here today what be go to do what be go to do let all of who want to stand up against racism do part to roll back the divide begin by seek out people in the workplace the classroom the community the neighborhood across town the place of worship to actually sit down and have those honest conversation talk about conversation where speak openly and listen and understand how other view this world of make no mistake about can bridge this great divide this be after all a very great country and have become great by what have overcome have the world 's strong economy and be on the move but have really last because have understand that success could never be measure solely by the size of gross national product believe the march in washington today spawn such an outpouring because be a reflection of something deep and strong that be run throughout american community believe that in millions|and|million of different way entire country be reassert commitment to the bedrock value that make country great and that make life worth live the great divide of the past call for and be address by legal and legislative change be address by leader like lyndon|johnson who pass and the|voting|rights|act and to be sure this great divide require a public response by democratically elect leader but today be really deal and know with problem that grow in large measure out of the way all of look at the world with mind and the way feel about the world with heart and therefore while leader and legislation may be important this be work that have to be do by every single of and this be the ultimate test of democracy for today the house divide exist largely in the mind and heart of the american people and must be unite there in the mind and heart of people yes there be some who would poison progress by sell short the great character of people and enormous capacity to change and grow but will not win the|day will win the|day with help with help that|day will come a lot sooner will do part but fellow citizen must do thank and god bless view transcript transcript thank very much to the members of congress who be here member of the cabinet and the administration fellow americans in recent|weeks have begin a conversation with the american people about fate and duty to prepare nation not only to meet the|new|century but to live and lead in a world transform to a degree seldom see in all of history much of this change be good but be not all good and all of be affect by therefore must reach beyond fear and division to a new time of great and common purpose challenge be twofold first to restore the american dream of opportunity and the american value of responsibility and second to bring country together amid all diversity into a strong community so that can find common ground and move forward as more than ever these endeavor be inseparable be absolutely convinced can not restore economic opportunity or solve social problem unless find a way to bring the american people together to bring people together must openly and honestly deal with the issue that divide today want to discuss of those issue affirmative action be in a way ironic that this issue should be divisive today because affirmative action begin by a republican president with bipartisan support begin simply as a means to an end of endure national purpose equal opportunity for all americans so let today trace the root of affirmative action in never end search for equal opportunity let determine what be and what be not let see where be work and where have not and ask what need to do now along the way let remember always that find common ground as move toward the|21st|century depend fundamentally on share commitment to equal opportunity for all americans be a moral imperative a constitutional mandate and a legal necessity there could be no well place for this discussion than the|national|archif for within these wall be america 's bedrock of common ground the|declaration|of|independence,|the constitution the|bill|of|rights no paper be as lasting as the word these document contain so put in these special case to protect the parchment from the element no building be as solid as the principle these document embody but sure try to build with these metal door thick to keep safe for these document be america 's only crown jewel but the good place of all to hold these word and these principle be the place in which can never fade and never grow old in the strong chamber of heart beyond all else country be a set of conviction hold these truth to be self evident that all man be create equal that be endow by creator with certain inalienable right that among these be life liberty and the pursuit of happiness whole history can be see first as an effort to preserve these right and then as an effort to make real in the life of all citizen know that from the beginning there be a great gap between the plain meaning of creed and the mean reality of daily life back then only white male property owner could vote black slave be not even count as whole people and native|americans be regard as little more than an obstacle to great national progress no wonder thomas|jefferson reflect on slavery say tremble to think god be just on the 200th anniversary of great constitution justice thurgood|marshall the grandson of a slave say the|government|our|founder devise be defective from the start require several amendment a civil war and momentous social transformation to attain the system of constitutional government and respect for the individual freedom and human right hold as fundamental today emancipation woman 's suffrage civil right voting right equal right the struggle for the right of the disabled all these and other struggle be milestone on america 's often rocky but fundamentally righteous journey to close the gap between the ideal enshrine in these treasure here in the|national|archif and the reality of daily life first come to this very spot where be stand today|32|years|ago|this|month be a 16-year old delegate to the|american|legion|boys|nation now that summer be a high water mark for national journey that be the|summer that president kennedy order alabama national guardsmen to enforce a court order to allow young black to enter the|university|of|alabama as tell nation every american ought to have the right to be treat as would wish to be treat as one would wish child to be treat later that same summer on the step of the|lincoln|memorial martin|luther|ke tell americans of dream that day the son of former slave and the son of former slaveowner would sit down together at the table of brotherhood that little child would be judge not by the color of skin but by the content of character word capture the heart and steel the will of million of americans some of sing with in the hot sun that|day million more like listen and weep in the privacy of home be hard to believe where be just|three|decades|ago when come up here to boys|nation and have this mock congressional session be of only|three or southerner who would even vote for the civil right plank that be largely because of family grandfather have a grade school education and run a grocery store across the street from the cemetery in hope arkansas where parent and grandparent be bury most of customer be black be poor and be work people as a child in that store see that people of different race could treat each other with respect and dignity but also see that the black neighborhood across the street be the only in town where the street be not pave and when return to that neighborhood in the|late|sixties to see a woman who have care for as a toddler the street still be not pave a lot of know that be an ardent movie goer as a child never go to a movie where could sit next to a black american be always sit upstairs in the 's believe or not there be still a few courthouse square in state where the restroom be mark white and colored graduate from a segregated high school 7|year after president eisenhower integrate little|rock|central|high|school and when president kennedy barely carry home state in the poll tax system be still alive and well there even though grandparent be in a minority be poor southern white who be pro - civil right think most other people know better than to think the way do and those who be smart enough to act differently discover a lesson that ought to remember today discrimination be not just morally wrong hurt everybody in atlanta georgia in reaction to all the thing that be go on all across the south adopt the motto the city too busy to hate and however imperfectly over the|year try to live by be convince that atlanta 's success now be home to more foreign corporation than any other american city and one|year from today will begin to host the olympics that that success all begin when people get too busy to hate the lesson learn be a hard one when allow people to pit against another or spend energy denying opportunity base on difference everyone be hold back but when give all americans a chance to develop and use talent to be full partner in common enterprise then everybody be push forward experience with discrimination be root in the south and in the legacy slavery leave also live with a work mother and a work grandmother when woman 's work be far rare and far more circumscribed than be today but all know there be million of other story those of hispanics asian americans native|americans people with disability other against whom finger have be point many of have own story and that be why be here today people who be deny the right to develop and to use full human potential and progress too be a part of journey to make the reality of america consistent with the principle just behind here thirty|years|ago in this city do not see many people of color or woman make way to work in the morning in business clothe or serve in substantial number in powerful position in congress or at the|white|house or make executive decision every day in business in fact even the employment want ad be divide man on side and woman on the other be extraordinary then to see woman or people of color as television news anchor or believe or not even in college sport there be far few woman and minority as job supervisor or firefighter or police officer or doctor or lawyer or college professor or in many other job that offer stability and honor and integrity to family life a lot have change and do not happen as some sort of random evolutionary drift take hard work and sacrifice and countless act of courage and conscience by million of americans take the political courage and statesmanship of democrats and republicans alike the vigilance and compassion of court and advocate in and out of government commit to the constitution and to equal protection and to equal opportunity take the leadership of people in business who know that in the end would all be well take the leadership of people in labor union who know that work people have to be reconcile some people like congressman lewis there put life on the line other people lose life and million of americans change own life and put hate behind as a result today all life be well woman have become a major force in business and political life and far more able to contribute to family ' income a true and grow black middle class have emerge high education have literally be revolutionize with woman and racial and ethnic minority attend once overwhelmingly white and sometimes all male school in community across nation police department now better reflect the makeup of those whom protect a generation of professional now serve as role model for young woman and minority youth hispanic and new immigrant population be succeed in make america stronger for an example of where the good of future lie just think about space program and the stunning hookup with the russian space station this|month let remember that that program the world 's fine begin with hero like alan|shepard and senator john|glenn but today be have american hero like ellen|ochoa leroy chiao guy|bluford and other outstanding completely qualified woman and minority how do this happen fundamentally because open heart and mind and change way but not without pressure the pressure of court decision legislation executive action and the power of example in the public and private sector along the way learn that law alone do not change society that old habit and thinking pattern be deeply ingrained and die hard that more be require to really open the door of opportunity search to find way to move more quickly to equal opportunity lead to the development of what now call affirmative action the purpose of affirmative action be to give nation a way to finally address the systemic exclusion of individual of talent on the basis of gender or race from opportunity to develop perform achieve and contribute affirmative action be an effort to develop a systematic approach to open the door of education employment and business development opportunity to qualified individual who happen to be member of group that have experience longstanding and persistent discrimination be a policy that grow out of many|years of try to navigate between unacceptable past be to say simply that declare discrimination illegal and that be enough see that that way still relegate black with college degree to job as railroad porter and keep woman with degree under a glass ceiling with a low paycheck the other path be simply to try to impose change by level draconian penalty on employer who do not meet certain impose ultimately arbitrary and sometimes unachievable quota that too be reject out of a sense of fairness so a middle ground be develop that would change an inequitable status quo gradually but firmly by build the pool of qualified applicant for college for contract for job and give more people the chance to learn work and earn when affirmative action be do right be flexible be fair and work know some people be honestly concerned about the time affirmative action do not work when be do in the wrong way and know there be time when some employer do not use in the right way may cut corner and treat a flexible goal as a quota may give opportunity to people who be unqualified instead of those who deserve may in so do allow a different kind of discrimination when this happen be also wrong but be not affirmative action and be not legal so when administration find case of that sort will enforce the law aggressively the|justice|department file hundred of case every|year attack discrimination in employment include suit on behalf of white male most of these suit however affect woman and minority for a simple reason because the vast majority of discrimination in america be still discrimination against but the law do require fairness for everyone and be determined to see that that be exactly what the law deliver let be clear about what affirmative action must not mean and what will not allow to be do not mean and do not favor the unjustified preference of the unqualified over the qualified of any race or gender do not mean and do not favor numerical quota do not mean and do not favor rejection or selection of any employee or student solely on the basis of race or gender without regard to merit like many business executive and public servant owe to to say that view on this subject be more than anything else the product of personal experience have have experience with affirmative action nearly|20|year of now and know work when be attorney general of home state hire a record number of woman and african american lawyer every one clearly qualified and exceptionally hardworking as governor appoint more woman to cabinet and state board than any other governor in the state 's history and more african americans than all the governors in the state 's history combine and no one ever question qualification or performance and state be well and strong because of service as president be proud to have the most diverse administration in history in cabinet agency and staff and must say have be surprised at the criticism have receive from some quarter in determination to achieve this in the|last|2|1/2|years the most outstanding example of affirmative action in the|united|state the pentagon have open position for woman who serve in armed|force have appoint more woman and minority to the federal bench than any other president more than the last combined and yet far more of judicial appointment have receive the high rating from the|american|bar|association than any other administration since those rating have be give in administration many government agency be do more business with qualified firm run by minority and woman the|small|business|administration have reduce budget by double loan output dramatically increase the number of loan to woman and minority small business people without reduce the number of loan to white businessowner who happen to be male and without change the loan standard for a single solitary application quality and diversity can go hand in hand and must let say that affirmative action have also do more than just open the door of opportunity to individual americans most economist who study agree that affirmative action have also be an important part of close gap in economic opportunity in society thereby strengthen the entire economy a group of distinguished business leader tell just|a|couple|of|days|ago that company be strong and profit be large because of the diversity and the excellence of work force achieve through intelligent and fair affirmative action program and say have go far beyond anything the government may require to do because manage diversity and individual opportunity and be fair to everybody be the key to future economic success in the global marketplace now there be those who say fellow americans that even good affirmative action program be no longer need that should be enough to resort to the court or the|equal|employment|opportunity|commission in case of actual provable individual discrimination because there be no longer any systematic discrimination in society in decide how to answer that let consider the fact the unemployment rate for african americans remain about twice that of white the hispanic rate be still much high woman have narrow the earning gap but still make only|72|percent as much as man do for comparable job the average income for an hispanic woman with a college degree be still less than the average income of a white man with a high school diploma accord to the recently complete glass ceiling report sponsor by republican members of congress in the nation 's large company only|six tenth of one|percent of senior management position be hold by african americans tenth of a percent by hispanic americans tenth of a percent by asian americans woman hold between of these position white male make up of work force but hold of these job just|last|week report that black home loan applicant be more than twice as likely to be deny credit as white with the same qualification and that hispanic applicant be more|than|1|1/2 time as likely to be deny loan as white with the same qualification last|year alone the|federal|government receive more|than|90,000 complaint of employment discrimination base on race ethnicity or gender less|than|3|percent be for reverse discrimination evidence abound in other way of the persistence of the kind of bigotry that can affect the way think even if be not conscious of in hiring and promotion and business and educational decision crime and violence base on hate against asians hispanics african americans and other minority be still with and be sorry to say that the bad and most recent evidence of this involve a recent report of federal law enforcement official in tennessee attend an event literally overflow with racism a sicken reminder of just how pervasive these kind of attitude still be by the way want to tell that be commit to find the truth about what happen there and to take appropriate action and want to say that if anybody who work in federal law enforcement think that that kind of behavior be acceptable ought to think about work someplace else now let get to the other side of the argument if affirmative action have work and if there be evidence that discrimination still exist on a wide scale in way that be conscious and unconscious then why should get rid of as many people be urge some question the effectiveness or the fairness of particular affirmative action program say to all of those be fair question and prompt the review of affirmative action program about which will talk in a few moment some question the fundamental purpose of the effort there be people who honestly believe that affirmative action always amount to group preference over individual merit that affirmative action always lead to reverse discrimination that ultimately therefore demean those who benefit from and discriminate against those who be not help by just have to tell that all of have to decide how feel about that and all of fellow country man and woman have to decide as well but believe if there be no quota if give no opportunity to unqualified people if have no reverse discrimination and if when the problem end the program end that criticism be wrong that be what believe but should have this debate and everyone should ask the question now let deal with what really think be behind so much of this debate today there be a lot of people who oppose affirmative action today who support for a very long time believe be respond to the sea change in the experience that most americans have in the world in which live if say now be against affirmative action because the government be use power or the private sector be use power to help minority at the expense of the majority that give a way of explain away the economic distress that a majority of americans honestly feel give a way of turn resentment against the minority or against a particular government program instead of have an honest debate about how all get into the fix be in and what be all go to do together to get out of that explanation the affirmative action explanation for the fix be in be just wrong be just wrong affirmative action do not cause the great economic problem of the american middle class and because most minority or woman be either member of that middle class or people who be poor who be struggle to get into must also admit that affirmative action alone will not solve the problem of minority and woman who seek to be a part of the american dream to do that have to have an economic strategy that reverse the decline in wage and the growth of poverty among work people without that woman minority and white male will all be in trouble in the future but be wrong to use the anxiety of the middle class to divert the american people from the real cause of economic distress the sweeping historic change take all the globe in path and the specific policy or lack of in own country which have aggravate those challenge be simply wrong to play politic with the issue of affirmative action and divide country at a time when if be really go to change thing have to be unite must say think be ironic that some of those — not all but some of those who call for an end to affirmative action also advocate policy which will make the real economic problem of the anxious middle class even worse talk about opportunity and be for equal opportunity for everyone and then reduce investment in equal opportunity on an evenhanded basis for example if the real goal be economic opportunity for all americans why in the world would reduce investment in education from head start to affordable college loan why do not make college loan available to every american instead if the real goal be empower all middle class americans and empower poor people to work way into the middle class without regard to race or gender why in the world would the people who advocate that turn around and raise taxis on poor working family or reduce the money available for education and training when lose job or be live on poverty wage or increase the cost of housing for low income work people with child why would do that if be go to empower america have to do more than talk about have to do and surely have learn that can not empower all americans by a simple strategy of take opportunity away from some americans so to those who use this as a political strategy to divide must say no must say no but to those who raise legitimate question about the way affirmative action work or who raise the large question about the genuine problem and anxiety of all the american people and sense of be leave behind and treat unfairly must say yes be entitle to answer to question must say yes to that now that be why order this review of all of affirmative action program a review design to look at the fact not the politic of affirmative action this review conclude that affirmative action remain a useful tool for widen economic and educational opportunity the model use by the military the army in particular and be delighted to have the|commanding|general|of|the|army here today because set such a fine example have be especially successful because emphasize education and training ensure that have a wide pool of qualified candidate for every level of promotion that approach have give the most racially diverse and good qualified military in history there be more opportunity for woman and minority there than ever before and now there be over|50 general and admiral who be hispanic asian or african americans find that the|education|department target on — have program target on under represent minority that do a great deal of good with the tiniest of investment find that these program comprise of every in the|education|department 's budget now college president will tell that the education school offer actually benefit from diversity college where young people get the education and make the personal and professional contact that will shape life if college look like the world be go to live and work in and learn from all different kind of people thing that can not learn in book system of high education be strong still believe every child need the chance to go to college every child that mean every child have to have a chance to get affordable and repayable college loan pell grant for poor kid and a chance to do thing like join americorps and work way through school every child be entitle to that that be not an argument against affirmative action be an argument for more opportunity for more americans until everyone be reach as say a moment ago the review find that the|small|business|administration last|year increase loan to minority by over|two third loan to woman by do not decrease loan to white man and not a single loan go to an unqualified person people who never have a chance before to be part of the american system of free enterprise now have no one be hurt in the process that make america strong this review also find that the executive order on employment practice of large federal contractor also have help to bring more fairness and inclusion into the work force since president nixon be here in job america have use goal and timetable to preserve opportunity and to prevent discrimination to urge business to set high expectation for and to realize those expectation but do not and will not use rigid quota to mandate outcome also look at the way award procurement contract under the program know as set aside there be no question that these program have help to build up firm own by minority and woman who historically have be exclude from the old boy network in these area have help a new generation of entrepreneur to flourish open new path to self reliance and an economic growth in which all of ultimately share because of the set aside business ready to compete have have a chance to compete a chance would not have otherwise have but as with any government program set aside can be misapply misuse even intentionally abuse there be critic who exploit that fact as an excuse to abolish all these program regardless of effect believe be wrong but also believe base on factual review clearly need some reform so first should crack down on those who take advantage of everyone else through fraud and abuse must crack down on front and pass through people who pretend to be eligible for these program and be not that be wrong also in offer new business a leg up must make sure that the set aside go to business that need most must really look and make sure that standard for eligibility be fair and defensible have to tighten the requirement to move business out of program once have have a fair opportunity to compete the graduation requirement must mean something must mean graduation there should be no permanent set aside for any company second must and will comply with the|supreme|court 's adarand decision of last|month now in particular that mean focus set aside program on particular region and business sector where the problem of discrimination or exclusion be provable and be clearly require affirmative action have direct the attorney general and the agency to move forward with compliance with adarand expeditiously but also want to emphasize that the adarand decision do not dismantle affirmative action and do not dismantle set aside in fact while set strict standard to mandate reform of affirmative action actually reaffirm the need for affirmative action and reaffirm the continue existence of systematic discrimination in the|united|state what the|supreme|court order to do be to meet the same more rigorous standard for affirmative action program that state and local government be order to meet and the good set aside program under that standard have be challenge and have survive third beyond discrimination need to do more to help disadvantaged people and distressed community no matter what race or gender there be place in country where the free enterprise system simply do not reach simply be not work to provide job and opportunity disproportionately these area in urban and rural america be highly populate by racial minority but not entirely to make this initiative work believe the government must become a well partner for people in place in urban and rural america that be catch in a cycle of poverty and believe have to find way to get the private sector to assume rightful role as a driver of economic growth have always amazed that have give incentive to business people to help to develop poor economy in other part of the world neighbor in the caribbean neighbor in other part of the world have support this when not subject to own abuse but ignore the big source of economic growth available to the american economy the poor economy isolate within the|united|states|of|america there be those who say well even if make the job available people would not work have not try most of the people in disadvantaged community work today and most of who do not work have a very strong desire to do so in central harlem people apply for every single minimum wage job opening think how many more would apply if there be good job with a good future job have to connect disadvantaged people and disadvantaged community to economic opportunity so that everybody who want to work can do so have be work at this through empowerment zone and community develop bank through the initiative of secretary cisneros|of the|housing|and|urban|development|department and many other thing that have try to do to put capital where be need and now have ask vice president gore to develop a proposal to use contracting to support business that locate in these distressed area or hire a large percentage of worker from these area not to supplement what be do in affirmative action — not to substitute for but to supplement to go beyond to do something that will help to deal with the economic crisis of america want to make procurement system more responsive to people in these area who need help fellow americans affirmative action have to be make consistent with high ideal of personal responsibility and merit and urgent need to find common ground and to prepare all americans to compete in the global economy of the|next|century today be direct all agency to comply with the|supreme|court 's adarand decision and also to apply the standard of fairness to all affirmative action program that have already articulate no quota in theory or practice no illegal discrimination of any kind include reverse discrimination no preference for people who be not qualified for any job or other opportunity and as soon as a program have succeed must be retire any program that do not meet these principle must be eliminate or reform to meet but let be clear affirmative action have be good for america affirmative action have not always be perfect and affirmative action should not go on forever should be change now to take care of those thing that be wrong and should be retire when job be do be resolve that that|day will come but the evidence suggest indeed scream that that|day have not come the job of end discrimination in this country be not over that should not be surprising have slavery for century before the passage of and 15th amendment wait another|100|years for the civil right legislation woman have have the vote have always have difficulty with these thing as most society do but be make more progress than many people base on the evidence the job be not do so here be what think should do should reaffirm the principle of affirmative action and fix the practice should have a simple slogan mend but do not end let ask all americans whether agree or disagree with what have say today to see this issue in the large context of time president lincoln say can not escape history can not escape future either and that future must be in which every american have the chance to live up to or god give capacity the new technology the instant communication the explosion of global commerce have create enormous opportunity and enormous anxiety for americans in the|last|2|1/2|year have see new job

of the|21st|century have get to find the wisdom and the will to create family wage job for all the people who want to work to open the door of college to all americans to strengthen family and reduce the awful problem to which child be expose to move poor americans from welfare to work this be the work of administration to give people the tool need to make the most of own life to give family and communitie the tool need to solve own problem but let not forget affirmative action do not cause these problem will not solve and get rid of affirmative action certainly will not solve if properly do affirmative action can help come together go forward and grow together be in moral legal and practical interest to see that every person can make the most of own life in the fight for the future need

together less and shout at each other more the common bond of community which have be the great strength of country from very beginning be badly frayed what be to do about more|than|60|years|ago at the dawn of another new era president roosevelt tell nation new condition impose new requirement on government and those who conduct government and from that simple proposition shape the new deal which help to restore nation to prosperity and define the relationship between people and government for half|a|century that approach work in time but today face a very different time and very different condition be move from an industrial age build on gear and sweat to an information age demand skill and learning and flexibility government once a champion of national purpose be now see by many as simply a captive of narrow interest put more burden on citizen rather than equip to get ahead the value that use to hold all together seem to be come apart so tonight must forge a new social compact to meet the challenge of this time as enter a new era need a new set of understanding not just with government but even more important with another as americans that be what want to talk with about tonight call the|new|covenant but be ground in a very very old idea that all americans have not just a right but a solemn responsibility to rise as far as god give talent and determination can take and to give something back to community and country in return opportunity and responsibility go hand in hand can not have without the other and national community can not hold together without

simple one be good for the american people let begin by say that can not ask americans to be well citizen if be not well servant make a good start by pass that law which apply to congress all the law put on the private sector and be proud to sign yesterday but have a lot more to do before people really trust the way thing work around here time as many lobbyist be in the street and corridor of washington as be here the american people look at capital and see a city where the well connect and the well protect can work the system but the interest of ordinary citizen be often leave out as the new congress open door lobbyist be still do business as usual the gift the trip all the thing that people be concerned about have not stop twice this|month miss opportunity to stop these practice know there be other consideration in those vote but want to use something that have hear republican friend say from time to time there do not have to be a law for everything so tonight ask to just stop take the lobbyist ' perk just stop do not have to wait for legislation to pass to send a strong signal to the american people that thing be really change but also hope will send the strong possible lobby reform bill and will sign that too should require lobbyist to tell the people for whom work what be spend what want should also curb the role of big money in election by cap the cost of campaign and limit the influence of pacs and as have say for three|years should work to open the airwave so that can be an instrument of democracy not a weapon of destruction by give free tv time to candidate for public office when the last congress kill political reform last|year be report in the press that the lobbyist actually stand in the hall of this sacred building and cheer this|year let give the folk at home something to cheer about more important think all agree that have to change the way the government work let make small less costly and smarter lean not mean applause just tell the speaker the equal time doctrine be alive and well laughter the new covenant approach to governing be as different from the old bureaucratic way as the computer be from the manual typewriter the old way of govern around here protect organized interest should look out for the interest of ordinary people the old way divide by interest constituency or class the new covenant way should unite behind a common vision of what be good for country the old way dispense service through large top down inflexible bureaucracy the new covenant way should shift these resource and decisionmake from bureaucrat to citizen inject choice and competition and individual responsibility into national policy the old way of govern around here actually seem to reward failure the new covenant way should have build in incentive to reward success the old way be centralize here in washington the new covenant way must take hold in the community all across america and should help to do that job here be to expand opportunity not bureaucracy to empower people to make the most of own life and to enhance security here at home and abroad must not ask government to do what should do for should rely on government as a partner to help to do more for and for each other hope very much that as debate these specific and exciting matter can go beyond the sterile discussion between the illusion that there be somehow a program for every problem on the hand and the other illusion that the government be a source of every problem have job be to get rid of yesterday 's government so that own people can meet today 's and tomorrow 's need and ought to do together know for year before become president hear other say would cut government and how bad be but not much happen actually do cut over a quarter of

will be discuss here in the|next|few|week university administrator all over the country have tell that be save week and week of bureaucratic time now because of direct college loan program which make college loan cheap and more affordable with well repayment term for student cost the government less and cut out paperwork and bureaucracy for the government and for the university should not cap that

be a second round of reinventing|government propose to cut in spending by shrink department extend freeze on domestic spending cut public housing program down to get rid of over program do not need like the|interstate|commerce|commission and the|helium|reserve|program and be work on get rid of unnecessary regulation and make more sensible the program and regulation that have outlive usefulness should go have to cut yesterday 's government to help solve tomorrow 's problem and need to get government closer to the people be mean to serve need to help move program down to the point where state and community and private citizen in the private sector can do a well job if can do ought to let do should get out of the way and let do what can do better take power away from federal bureaucracy and give back to community and individual be something everyone should be able to be for be time for congress to stop pass on to the state the cost of decision make here in washington know there be still serious difference over the detail of the unfunded mandate legislation but want to work with to make sure pass a reasonable bill which will protect the national interest and give justified relief where need to give for year congress conceal in the budget score of pet spending project last|year be no difference there be a to study stress in plant and for a tick removal program that do not work be hard to remove tick those of who have have know laughter but will tell something if will give line item veto will remove some of that unnecessary spending but think should all remember and almost all of would agree that government still have important responsibility young people — should think of this when cut — young people hold future in hand still owe a debt to veteran and senior citizen have make what be now budget cut a lot but protect education veteran social|security and medicare and hope will do the same thing should and hope will and when give more flexibility to the state let remember that there be certain fundamental national need that should be address in every state north|and|south east and west immunization against childhood disease school lunch in all school head start medical care and nutrition for pregnant woman and infants—[applause]—medical care and nutrition for pregnant woman and infant all these thing all these thing be in the national interest applaud desire to get rid of costly and unnecessary regulation but when deregulate let remember what national action in the national interest have give safe food for family safe toy for child safe nursing home for parent safe car and highway and safe workplace clean air and clean water do need common sense and fairness in regulation bet do but can have common sense and still provide for safe drinking water can have fairness and still clean up toxic dump and ought to do should cut the deficit more well of course should of course should but can bring down in a way that still protect economic recovery and do not unduly punish people who should not be punish but instead should be help know many of in this chamber support the balanced budget amendment certainly want to balance the budget administration have do more to bring the budget down and to save money than any in a very very long time if believe pass this amendment be the right thing to do then have to be straight with the american people have a right to know what be go to cut what tax be go to raise and how be go to affect should be do thing in the open around here for example everybody ought to know if this proposal be go to endanger social|security would oppose that and think most americans would nothing have do more to undermine sense of common responsibility than fail welfare system this be of the problem have to face here in washington in new covenant reward welfare over work undermine family value let million of parent get away without pay child support keep a minority but a significant minority of the people on welfare trap on for a very long time have work on this problem for a long time nearly|15|year now as a governor have the honor of work with the reagan administration to write the last welfare reform bill back in in the|last|two|year make a good start at continue the work of welfare reform administration give two|dozen state the right to slash through federal rule and regulation to reform own welfare system and to try to promote work and responsibility over welfare and dependency last|year introduce the most sweeping welfare reform plan ever present by an administration have to make welfare what be mean to be a second chance not a way of life have to help those on welfare move to work as quickly as possible to provide child care and teach skill if that be what need for up|to|two|year and after that there ought to be a simple hard rule anyone who can work must go to work if a parent be not pay child support should be force to pay should suspend driver ' license track across state line make work off what owe that be what should do government do not raise child people do and the parent must take responsibility for the child bring into this world want to work with with all of to pass welfare reform but goal must be to liberate people and lift up from dependence to independence from welfare to work from mere childbeare to responsible parenting goal should not be to punish because happen to be poor should should require work and mutual responsibility but should not cut people off just because be poor be young or even because be unmarried should promote responsibility by require young mother to live at home with parent or in other supervised setting by require to finish school but should not put and child out on the street and know all the argument pro and con and have read and think about this for a long time still do not think can in good conscience punish poor child for the mistake of parent fellow americans every single survey show that all the american people care about this without regard to party or race or region so let this be the|year end welfare as know but also let this be the|year that be all able to stop use this issue to divide america no one be more eager to end welfare—[applause]—i may be the only president who have actually have the opportunity to sit in a welfare office who be actually spend hours|and|hour talk to people on welfare and be tell the people who be trap on know do not work also want to get off so can promote together education and work and good parenting have no problem with punish bad behavior or the refusal to be a worker or a student or a responsible parent just do not want to punish poverty and past mistake all of have make mistake and none of can change yesterday but every of can change tomorrow and america 's good example of that may be lynn|woolsey who work way off welfare to become a congresswoman from know the member of this congress be concerned about crime as be all the citizen of country and remind that last|year pass a very tough crime bill long sentence strike and be out new capital punishment offense more prison more prevention more police and pay for all by reduce the size of the federal bureaucracy and give the money back to local community to lower the crime rate there may be other thing can do to be tough on crime to be smart with crime to help to lower that rate first well if there be let talk about and let do but let not go back on the thing that do last|year that know work that know work because the local law enforcement officer tell that do the right thing because local community leader who have work for year and year to lower the crime rate tell that work let look at the experience of city and rural area where the crime rate have go down and ask the people who do how do and if what do last|year support the decline in the crime rate and be convinced that do — let not go back on let stick with implement have get four|more|hard|year of work to do to do that do not want to destroy the good atmosphere in the room or in the country tonight but have to mention issue that divide this body greatly last|year the last congress also pass the brady bill and in the crime bill the ban on assault weapon do not think be a secret to anybody in this room that several member of the last congress who vote for that be not here tonight because vote for and know therefore that some of who be here because vote for be under enormous pressure to repeal just have to tell how feel about the member of congress who vote for that bill and would never do anything to infringe on the right to keep and bear arm to hunt and to engage in other appropriate sporting activity have do since be a boy and be go to keep right on do until can not do anymore but a lot of people lay down seat in congress so that police officer and kid would not have to lay down life under a hail of assault weapon attack and will not let that be repeal will not let be repeal would like to talk about a couple of other issue have to deal with want to cut more spending but hope will not cut government program that help to prepare for the new economy promote responsibility and be organize from the grassroot up not by gederal bureaucracy the very good example of this be the national service corps americorps pass with strong bipartisan support and now there be americans more than ever serve in one|year in the|peace|corp work all over this country help people person to person in local grassroots volunteer group solve problem and in the process earn some money for education this be citizenship at good be good for the americorps member but be good for the rest of too be the essence of the|new|covenant and should not stop all americans not only in the state most heavily affected but in every place in this country be rightly disturb by the large number of illegal alien enter country the job hold may otherwise be hold by citizen or legal immigrant the public service use impose burden on taxpayer that be why administration have move aggressively to secure border more by hire a record number of new border guard by deport twice as many criminal alien as ever before by crack down on illegal hiring by bar welfare benefit to illegal alien in the budget will present to will try to do more to speed the deportation of illegal alien who be arrest for crime to better identify illegal alien in the workplace as recommend by the commission head by former congresswoman barbara|jordan be a nation of immigrant but be also a nation of law be wrong and ultimately self defeat for a nation of immigrant to permit the kind of abuse of immigration law have see in recent|years and must do more to stop the most important job of government in this new era be to empower the american people to succeed in the global economy america have always be a land of opportunity a land where if work hard can get ahead have become a great middle class country middle class value sustain must expand that middle class and shrink the underclass even as do everything can to support the million of americans who be already successful in the new economy america be once again the world 's strong economic power new job in the|last|two|year export boom inflation down high wage job be come back a record number of american entrepreneur be live the american dream if want to stay that way those who work and lift nation must have more of benefit today too many of those people be be leave out be work harder for less have less security less income less certainty that can even afford a vacation much less college for kid or retirement for can not let this continue if do not act economy will probably keep do what be be do since about|1978 when the income growth begin to go to those at the very top of economic scale and the people in the vast middle get very little growth and people who work like crazy but be on the bottom then fall even further and further behind in the|year afterward no matter how hard work have get to have a government that can be a real partner in make this new economy work for all of people a government that help each and every of to get an education and to have the opportunity to renew skill that be why work so hard to increase educational opportunity in the|last|two|year from head start to public school to apprenticeship for young people who do not go to college to make college loan more available and more affordable that be the first thing have to do have get to do something to empower people to improve skill the second thing ought to do be to help people raise income immediately by lower taxis take the first step in with a work family tax cut for family with income under a tax cut that this|year will average a family and also give tax reduction to most small and new business before could do more than that first have to bring down the deficit inherit and have to get economic growth up now have do both and now can cut taxis in a more comprehensive way but tax cut should reinforce and promote first obligation to empower citizen through education and training to make the most of own life the spotlight should shine on those who make the right choice for family and community have propose the middle class bill of right which should properly be call the bill of right and responsibility because provision only benefit those who be work to educate and raise child and to educate will therefore give need tax relief and raise income in both the short run and the long run in a way that benefit all of there be provision first a tax deduction for all education and training after high school if think about permit business to deduct investment permit individual to deduct interest on home mortgage but today an education be even more important to the economic well being of whole country than even those thing be should do everything can to encourage and hope will support second ought to cut taxis for family with child under|13 third ought to foster more saving and personal responsibility by permit people to establish an individual retirement account and withdraw from tax free for the cost of education health care first time homebuying or the care of a parent and fourth should pass a gi bill for america 's worker propose to collapse nearly|70 federal program and not give the money to the state but give the money directly to the american people offer voucher to so that if be lay off or if be work for a very low wage can get a voucher worth a year for up|to|two|year to go to local community college or wherever else want to get the skill need to improve life let empower people in this way move from the government directly to the worker of america now any of can call for a tax cut but will not accept that explode the deficit or put recovery at risk ought to pay for tax cut fully and honestly just|two|years|ago be an open question whether would find the strength to cut the deficit thank to the courage of the people who be here then many of whom do not return do cut the deficit begin to do what other say would not be do cut the deficit by over|$600|billion for every family in this country be come down three|years|in|a|row for the first time since mr. truman be president and do not think anybody in america want to let explode again in the budget will send the middle class bill of right be fully pay for by budget cut in bureaucracy cut in program cut in special interest subsidy and the spending cut will more than double the tax cut budget pay for the middle class bill of right without any cut in medicare and will oppose any attempt to pay for tax cut with medicare cut that be not the right thing to do know that a lot of have own idea about tax relief and some of find quite interesting really want to work with all of test for proposal will be will create job and raise income will strengthen family and support child be pay for will build the middle class and shrink the underclass if do will support but if do not will not the goal of build the middle class and shrink the underclass be also why believe that should raise the minimum wage reward work two|and|a|half|million americans two|and|a|half|million americans often woman with child be work out there today for an hour in term of real buying power by next|year that minimum wage will be at a 40-year low that be not idea of how the new economy ought to work now have study the argument and the evidence for and against a minimum wage increase believe the weight of the evidence be that a modest increase do not cost job and may even lure people back into the job market but the most important thing be can not make a living on an hour especially if have child even with the work family tax cut pass last|year in the past the minimum wage have be a bipartisan issue and think should be again so want to challenge to have honest hearing on this to get together to find a way to make the minimum wage a living wage member of congress have be here less|than|a|month but by the|end|of|the|week into the|new|year every member of congress will have earn as much in congressional salary as a minimum wage worker make all|year|long everybody else here include the president have something else that too many americans do without and that be health care now last|year almost come to blow over health care but do not do anything and the cold hard fact be that since last|year since be here another americans in work family have lose health care and the cold hard fact be that many|million more most of farmer and small business people and self employ people have see premium skyrocket co - pay and deductible go up there be a whole bunch of people in this country that in the statistic have health insurance but really what have get be a piece of paper that say will not lose home if get sick now still believe country have get to move toward provide health security for every american family but know that last|year as the evidence indicate bite off more than could chew so be ask that work together let do step by step let do whatever have to do to get something do let at least pass meaningful insurance reform so that no american risk lose coverage for face skyrocket price that nobody lose coverage because face high price or unavailable insurance when change job or lose a job or a family member get sick want to work together with all of who have an interest in this with the democrats who work on last time with the republican leader like senator dole who have a longtime commitment to health care reform and make some constructive proposal in this area last|year ought to make sure that self employ people in small business can buy insurance at more affordable rate through voluntary purchasing pool ought to help family provide long term care for a sick parent or a disabled child can work to help worker who lose job at least keep health insurance coverage for a|year while look for work and can find a way may take some time but can find a way to make sure that child have health care know think everybody in this room without regard to party can be proud of the fact that country be rat as have the world 's most productive economy for the first time in nearly|a|decade but can not be proud of the fact that be the only wealthy country in the world that have a small percentage of the work force and child with health insurance today than do the last time be the most productive economy in the world so let work together on this be too important for politic as usual much of what the american people be think about tonight be what have already talk about a lot of people think that the security concern of america today be entirely internal to border relate to the security of job and home and income and child street health and protect those border now that the cold war have pass be tempting to believe that all the security issue with the possible exception of trade reside here at home but be not so security still depend upon continued world leadership for peace and freedom and democracy still can not be strong at home unless be strong abroad the financial crisis in mexico be a case in point know be not popular to say tonight but have to act not for the mexican people but for the sake of the million of americans whose livelihood be tie to mexico 's well being if want to secure american job preserve american export safeguard america 's border then must pass the stabilization program and help to put mexico back on track now let repeat be not a loan be not foreign aid be not a bailout will be give a guarantee like cosign a note with good collateral that will cover risk this legislation be the right thing for america that be why the bipartisan leadership have support and hope in congress will pass quickly be in interest and can explain to the american people because be go to do in the right way know tonight this be the first state of the union address ever deliver since the beginning of when not a single russian missile be point at the child of america and along with the russians be on way to destroy the missile and the bomber that carry nuclear warhead have come so far so fast in this post - cold war world that be easy to take the decline of the nuclear threat for grant but be still there and be not finish yet this|year will ask the senate to approve start ii to eliminate weapon that carry more warhead the|united|state will lead the charge to extend indefinitely the|nuclear|non proliferation|treaty to enact a comprehensive nuclear test ban and to eliminate chemical weapon to stop and roll back north|korea 's potentially deadly nuclear program will continue to implement the agreement have reach with that nation be smart be tough be a deal base on continue inspection with safeguard for ally and this|year will submit to congress comprehensive legislation to strengthen hand in combat terrorist whether strike at home or abroad as the coward who bomb the|world|trade|center find out this country will hunt down terrorist and bring to justice just|this|week another horrendous terrorist act in israel

of office pledge that nation would maintain the best equipped best train and good prepared military on earth have and be have manage the dramatic downsizing of force after the cold war with remarkable skill and spirit but to make sure military be ready for action and to provide the pay and the quality of life the military and family deserve be ask the congress to add in defense spending over

the american people low deficit low inflation low interest rate low trade barrier and high investment these be the building block of recovery but if want to take full advantage of the opportunity before in the global economy all know must do more as reduce defense spending ask congress to invest more in the technology of tomorrow defense conversion will keep strong militarily and create job for people here at home as protect environment must invest in the environmental technology of the future which will create job this|year will fight for a revitalize clean|water|act and a safe drinking water act and a reformed superfund program and the vice president be right must also work with the private sector to connect every classroom every clinic every library every hospital in america into a national information super highway by the|year|2000 think of instant access to information will increase productivity will help to educate child will provide well medical care will create job and call on the congress to pass legislation to establish that information super highway this|year as expand opportunity and create job no one can be leave out must continue to enforce fair lending and fair housing and all civil right law because america will never be complete in renewal until everyone share in bounty but all know too can do all these thing put economic house in order expand world trade target the job of the future guarantee equal opportunity but if be honest will all admit that this strategy still can not work unless also give people the education training and skill need to seize the opportunity of tomorrow must set tough world class academic and occupational standard for all child and give teacher and student the tool need to meet goal proposal will empower individual school district to experiment with idea like charter school to be run by private corporation or have more public school choice to do whatever wish to do as long as measure every school by high standard be child learn what need to know to compete and win in the global economy goal link world class standard to grassroots reform and hope congress will pass without delay school to work initiative will for the first time link school to the world of work provide of apprenticeship beyond high school after all most of the people be count on to build economic future will not graduate from college be time to stop ignore and start empower must literally transform outdated unemployment system into a new reemployment system the old unemployment system just sort of keep go while wait for old job to come back have get to have a new system to move people into new and well job because most of those old job just do not come back and know that the only way to have real job security in the future to get a good job with a grow income be to have real skill and the ability to learn new one so have get to streamline today 's patchwork of training program and make a source of new skill for people who lose job reemployment not unemployment must become the centerpiece of economic renewal urge to pass in this session of congress and just as must transform unemployment system so must also revolutionize welfare system do not work defy value as a nation if value work can not justify a system that make welfare more attractive than work if people be worried about lose health care if value responsibility can not ignore the in child support absent parent ought to be pay to million of parent who be take care of child if value strong family can not perpetuate a system that actually penalize those who stay together can believe that a child who have a child get more money from the government for leave home than for stay home with a parent or a grandparent that be not just bad policy be wrong and ought to change work on this problem for year before become president with other governors and with member of congress of both party and with the previous administration of another party work on with people who be on welfare lot of and want to say something to everybody here who care about this issue the people who most want to change this system be the people who be dependent on want to get off welfare want to go back to work want to do right by kid once have a hearing when be a governor and bring in people on welfare from all over america who have find way to work the woman from state who testify be ask this question what be the good thing about be off welfare and in a job and without blink an eye look at governors and say when boy go to school and say what do mother do for a living can give an answer these people want a well system and ought to give to last|year begin this give the state more power to innovate because know that a lot of great idea come from outside washington and many state be already use then this congress take a dramatic step instead of tax people with modest income into poverty help to work way out of poverty by dramatically increase the earn income tax credit will lift work family out of poverty rewarding work over welfare make possible for people to be successful worker and successful parent now that be real welfare reform but there be more to be do this|spre will send a comprehensive welfare reform bill that build on the|family|support|act of and restore the basic value of work and responsibility will say to teenager if have a child out of wedlock will no longer give a check to set up a separate household want family to stay together say to absent parent who be not pay child support if be not provide for child will garnish wage suspend license track across state line and if necessary make some of work off what owe people who bring child into this world can not and must not walk away from but to all those who depend on welfare should offer ultimately a simple compact will provide the support the job training the child care need for up|to|two|year but after that anyone who can work must in the private sector wherever possible in community service if necessary that be the only way will ever make elfare what ought to be a second chance not a way of life know will be difficult to tackle welfare reform in at the same time tackle health care but let point out think be inevitable and imperative be estimate that one|million people be on welfare today because be the only way can get health care coverage for child those who choose to leave welfare for job without health benefit and many entry level job do not have health benefit find in the incredible position of pay taxis that help to pay for health care coverage for those who make the other choice to stay on welfare no wonder people leave work and go back to welfare to get health care coverage have get to solve the health care problem to have real welfare reform so this|year will make history by reform the health care system and would say to all of fellow public servant this be another issue where the people be way ahead of the politician that may not be popular with either party but happen to be the truth know the first lady have receive now almost|a|million letter from people all across america and from all walk of life would like to share just of with richard|anderson of reno nevada lose job and with health insurance two|weeks|later wife judy suffer a cerebral aneurysm rush to the hospital where stay in intensive care for the andersons ' bill be although judy recover and richard go back to work at an hour the bill be too much for and be literally force into bankruptcy mrs. clinton write to hillary no one in should have to lose everything have work for all life because be unfortunate enough to become ill be to help the richard and judy|andersons|of|america that the first lady and so many other have work so hard and so long on this health care reform issue owe thank and action know there be people here who say there be no health care crisis tell to richard and judy|anderson tell to the 58|million americans who have no coverage at all for some time each year tell to the americans with those preexist condition those folk be pay more or can not get insurance at all or can not ever change job because or someone in family have of those preexist condition tell to the small business burden by the skyrocketing cost of insurance most small business cover employee and pay on average more in premium than big business or government or tell to the|76|percent of insure americans out of whose policy have lifetime limit and that mean can find without any coverage at all just when need the most so if any of believe there be no crisis tell to those people because can not there be some people who literally do not understand the impact of this problem on people 's life and all have to do be go out and listen to just go talk to anywhere in any congressional district in this country be republicans and democrats and independent do not have a lick to do with party think do not get and be time show that do get from the|day begin health care initiative have be design to strengthen what be good about health care system the world 's good health care professional cut edge research and wonderful research institution medicare for old americans none of this none of should be put at risk but be pay more and more money for less and less care every year fewer and few americans even get to choose doctor every year doctor and nurse spend more time on paperwork and less time with patient because of the absolute bureaucratic nightmare the present system have become this system be riddle with inefficiency with abuse with fraud and everybody know in today 's health care system insurance company call the shot pick whom cover and how cover can cut off benefit when need coverage the most be in charge what do mean mean every|night|million of well insure americans go to bed just an illness an accident or a pink slip away from have no coverage or financial ruin mean every|morne million of americans go to work without any health insurance at all something the worker in no other advanced country in the world do mean that every|year more and more hard work people be tell to pick a new doctor because boss have have to pick a new plan and countless other turn down well job because know if take the well job will lose health insurance if just let the health care system continue to drift country will have people with less care few choice and high bill now approach protect the quality of care and people 's choice build on what work today in the private sector to expand employer base coverage to guarantee private insurance for every american and may say employer base private insurance for every american be propose by president richard|nixon to the|united|states|congress be a good idea then and be a well idea today why do want guarantee private insurance because right now out of people who have insurance get through employer and that should continue and if employer be provide good benefit at reasonable price that should continue too that ought to make the congress and the president feel well goal be health insurance everybody can depend on comprehensive benefit that cover preventive care and prescription drug health premium that do not just explode when get sick or get old the power no matter how small business be to choose dependable insurance at the same competitive rate government and big business get today simple form for people who be sick and most of all the freedom to choose a plan and the right to choose own doctor approach protect old americans every plan before the congress propose to slow the growth of medicare the difference be this believe those saving should be use to improve health care for senior citizen medicare must be protect and should cover prescription drug and should take the first step in cover long term care to those who would cut medicare without protect senior say the solution to today 's squeeze on middle class work people 's health care be not to put the squeeze on middle class retire people 's health care can do better than that when be all say and do be pretty simple to insurance ought to mean what use to mean pay a fair price for security and when get sick health care 's always there no matter what along with the guarantee of health security all have to admit too there must be more responsibility on the part of all of in how use this system people have to take kid to get immunize should all take advantage of preventive care must all work together to stop the violence that explode emergency room have to practice well health habit and can not abuse the system and those who do not have insurance under approach will get coverage but will have to pay something for too the minority of business that provide no insurance at all and in so do shift the cost of the care of employee to other should contribute something people who smoke should pay more for a pack of cigarette everybody can contribute something if want to solve the health care crisis there can not be any more something for nothing will not be easy but can be do now in the|coming|months hope very much to work with both democrats and republicans to reform a health care system by use the market to bring down cost and to achieve last health security but if look at history see that for this country have try to reform health care president roosevelt try president truman try president nixon try president carter try every time the special interest be powerful enough to defeat but not this time know that face up to these interest will require courage will raise critical question about the way finance campaign and how lobbyist yield influence the work of change frankly will never get any easy until limit the influence of well finance interest who profit from this current system so also must now call on to finish the job both houses begin last|year by pass tough and meaningful campaign finance reform and lobby reform legislation this|year know fellow americans this be really a test for all of the american people provide those of in government service with terrific health care benefit at reasonable cost have health care that be always there think need to give every hard work tax pay american the same health care security have already give to want to make this very clear be open as have say repeatedly to the good idea of concerned member of both party have no special brief for any specific approach even in own bill except this if send legislation that do not guarantee every american private health insurance that can never be take away will force to take this pen veto the legislation and will come right back here and start all over again but do not think that be go to happen think be ready to act now believe that be ready to act now and if be ready to guarantee every american the same health care that have health care that can never be take away now not next|year or the|year|after now be the time to stand with the people who send here now as take these step together to renew strength at home can not turn away from obligation to renew leadership abroad this be a promising moment because of the agreement have reach this|year last|year russia 's strategic nuclear missile soon will no longer be point at the|united|state nor will point ours at instead of build weapon in space russian scientist will help to build the international space station of course there be still danger in the world rampant arm proliferation bitter regional conflict ethnic and nationalist tension in many new democracy severe environmental degradation the world over and fanatic who seek to cripple the world 's city with terror as the world 's great power must therefore maintain defense and responsibility this|year secure indictment against terrorist and sanction against those who harbor work to promote environmentally sustainable economic growth achieve agreement with ukraine with belarus with kazahkstan to eliminate completely nuclear arsenal be work to achieve a korean|peninsula free of nuclear weapon will seek early ratification of a treaty to ban chemical weapon worldwide and earlier|today join with over|30 nation to begin negotiation on a comprehensive ban to stop all nuclear testing but nothing nothing be more important to security than nation 's armed force honor contribution include those who be carry out the long humanitarian air lift in history in bosnia those who will complete mission in somalia this|year and brave comrade who give life there force be the fine military nation have ever have and have pledge that as long as be president will remain the best equip the best train and the best prepared fighting force on the face of the earth last|year propose a defense plan that maintain post - cold war security at a low cost this|year many people urge to cut defense spending further to pay for other government program say no the budget send to congress draw the line against further defense cut protect the readiness and quality of force ultimately the good strategy be to do that must not cut defense further hope the congress without regard to party will support that position ultimately the good strategy to ensure security and to build a durable peace be to support the advance of democracy elsewhere democracy do not attack each other make well trading partner and partner in diplomacy that be why have support and the democratic reformer in russia and in the other state of the former soviet bloc applaud the bipartisan support this congress provide last|year for initiative to help russia ukraine and the other state through epic transformation support of reform must combine patience for the enormity of the task and vigilance for fundamental interest and value will continue to urge russia and the other state to press ahead with economic reform and will seek to cooperate with russia to solve regional problem while insist that if russian troop operate in neighboring state do so only when those state agree to presence and in strict accord with international standard but must also remember as these nation chart own future and must chart own future how much more secure and more prosperous own people will be if democratic and market reform succeed all across the former communist bloc policy have be to support that move and that have be the policy of the congress should continue that be why go to europe earlier|this|month to work with european partner to help to integrate all the former communist country into a europe that have a possibility of become unify for the first time in entire history entire history base on the simple commitment of all nation in europe to democracy to free market and to respect for exist border with ally have create a partnership for peace that invite state from the former soviet bloc and other non - nato member to work with nato in military cooperation when meet with central|europe 's leader include lech|walesa and vaclav|havel man who put life on the line for freedom tell that the security of region be important to country 's security this|year must also do more to support democratic renewal and human right and sustainable development all around the world will ask congress to ratify the new gatt accord will continue stand by south|africa as work way through bold and hopeful and difficult transition to democracy will convene a summit of the western hemisphere 's democratic leader from canada to the tip of and will continue to press for the restoration of true democracy in haiti and as build a more constructive relationship with china must continue to insist on clear sign of improvement in that nation 's human right record will also work for new progress toward the middle|east peace last|year the world watch yitzhak|rabin and yasser|arafat at the|white|house when have historic handshake of reconciliation but there be a long hard road ahead and on that road be determined that and administration will do all can to achieve a comprehensive and last peace for all the people of the region now there be some in country who argue that with america should turn back on the rest of the world many around the world be afraid would do just that but take this office on a pledge that have no partisan tinge to keep nation secure by remain engage in the rest of the world and this|year because of work together enact nafta keep military strong and prepared support democracy abroad have reaffirm america 's leadership america 's engagement and as a result the american people be more secure than be before but while americans be more secure from threat abroad think all know that in many way be less secure from threat here at home every|day the national peace be shatter by crime in petaluma california an innocent slumber party give way to agonize tragedy for the family of polly|klaas an ordinary train ride on long|island end in a hail of round a tourist in florida be nearly burn alive by bigot simply because be black right here in nation 's capital a brave young man name jason|white a policeman the son and grandson of policeman be ruthlessly gun down violent crime and the fear provoke be cripple society limit personal freedom and fray the tie that bind the crime bill before congress give a chance to do something about a chance to be tough and smart what do that mean let begin by say care a lot about this issue many|years|ago when start out in public life be the attorney general of state serve as a governor for a|dozen|years know what be like to sign law increase penalty to build more prison cell to carry out the death penalty understand this issue and be not a simple thing first must recognize that most violent crime be commit by a small percentage of criminal who too often break the law even when be on parole now those who commit crime should be punish and those who commit repeat violent crime should be tell when commit a third violent crime will be put away and put away for good strike and be out second must take serious step to reduce violence and prevent crime begin with more police officer and more community policing know right now that police who work the street know the folk have the respect of the neighborhood kid focus on high crime area know that be more likely to prevent crime as well as catch criminal look at the experience of houston where the crime rate drop in one|year when that approach be take here tonight be of those community policeman a brave young detective kevin|jett whose beat be eight|square block in of the tough neighborhood in new|york every|day restore some sanity and safety and a sense of value and connection to the people whose life protect would like to ask to stand up and be recognize tonight thank sir applause will be give a chance to give the child of this country the law abide work people of this country and do not forget in the tough neighborhood in this country in the high crime neighborhood in this country the vast majority of people get up every|day and obey the law pay taxis do good to raise kid deserve people like kevin|jett and be go to be give a chance to give the american people another of well train and urge to do have before crime legislation which also establish a police corps to encourage young people to get an education and pay off by serve as police officer which encourage retire military personnel to move into police force an inordinate resource for country which have a safe school provision which will give young people the chance to walk to school in safety and to be in school in safety instead of dodge bullet these be important thing the third thing have to do be to build on the brady bill the brady law to take further step to keep gun out of the hand of criminal want to say something about this issue hunter must always be free to hunt law abide adult should always be free to own gun and protect home respect that part of culture grow up in but want to ask the sportsman and other who lawfully own gun to join in this campaign to reduce gun violence say to know do not create this problem but need help to solve there be no sporting purpose on earth that should stop the|united|states|congress from banish assault weapon that out gun police and cut down child fourth must remember that drug be a factor in an enormous percentage of crime recent study indicate sadly that drug use be on the rise again among young people the crime bill contain all the crime bill contain more money for drug treatment for criminal addict and boot camp for youthful offender that include incentive to get off drug and to stay off drug administration 's budget with all cut contain a large increase in funding for drug treatment and drug education must pass both need desperately fellow americans the problem of violence be an american problem have no partisan or philosophical element therefore urge to find way as quickly as possible to set aside partisan difference and pass a strong smart tough crime bill but further urge to consider this as demand tough penalty for those who choose violence let also remember how come to this sad point in tough neighborhood on mean street in poor rural area have see a stunning and simultaneous breakdown of community family and work the heart and soul of civilized society this have create a vast vacuum which have be fill by violence and drug and gang so ask to remember that even as say no to crime must give people especially young people something to say yes to many of initiative from job training to welfare reform to health care to national service will help to rebuild distressed community to strengthen family to provide work but more need to be do that be what community empowerment agenda be all about challenge business to provide more investment through empowerment zone ensure bank will make loan in the same community deposit come from pass legislation to unleash the power of capital through community development bank to create job opportunity and hope where be need most think know that to really solve this problem will all have to put head together leave ideological armor aside and find some new idea to do even more and let be honest all know something else too problem go way beyond the reach of government be root in the loss of value in the disappearance of work and the breakdown of family and community fellow americans can cut the deficit create job promote democracy around the world pass welfare reform and health care pass the tough crime bill in history but still leave too many of people behind the american people have get to want to change from within if be go to bring back work and family and community can not renew country when within a|decade of the child will be bear into family where there have be no marriage can not renew this country when 13-year old boy get semi - automatic weapon to shoot old for kick can not renew country when child be have child and the father walk away as if the kid do not amount to anything can not renew the country when business eagerly look for new investment and new customer abroad but ignore those people right here at home who would give anything to have job and would gladly buy product if have the money to do can not renew country unless more of mean all of — be willing to join the church and the other good citizen people like all the minister have work with over the|year or the priest and the nun meet at lady of help in east los|angele or good friend tony|campollo in philadelphia unless be willing to work with people like that people who be save kid adopt school make street safe all of can do that can not renew country until realize that government do not raise child parent do parent who know child 's teacher and turn off the television and help with the homework and teach kid right from wrong those kind of parent can make all the difference know have be tell have get to stop point finger at these kid who have no future and reach hand out to country need need and deserve so say to tonight let give child a future let take away gun and give book let overcome despair and replace with hope let by example teach to obey the law respect neighbor and cherish value let weave these sturdy thread into a new american community that can once more stand strong against the force of despair and evil because everybody have a chance to walk into a well tomorrow oh there will be naysayer who fear that will not be equal to the challenge of this time but misread history heritage even today 's headline all those thing tell can and will overcome any challenge when the earth shake and fire rage in california when see the mississippi deluge the farmland of the midwest in a flood when the century 's bitter cold sweep from to newport|new seem as though the world be come apart at the seam but the american people just come together rise to the occasion neighbor help neighbor stranger risk life and limb to save total stranger show the well angel of nature let not reserve the well angel only for natural disaster leave deep and most profound problem to petty political fighting let instead be true to spirit face fact come together bring hope and move forward tonight fellow americans be summon to answer a question as old as the republic what be the state of union be grow strong but must be strong still with help and god 's help will be thank

american people be finally come to grip with the accumulate weight of crime and violence and the breakdown of family and community and the increase in drug and the decrease in job think finally may be ready to do something about anti there be something for each of to do there be change eau make from the outside in that be the job of the president the congress and the governors and the mayor and the social service agency and then there be some change be go to have to make from the inside out or the other will not matter that be what that magnificent song be about be not sometimes there be no answer from the outside in sometimes all the answer have to come from the value and the stirring and the voice that speak to from within so be begin be try to pass a bill to make people safe to put another police officer on the street to provide boot camp instead of prison for young people who can still be rescue to provide more safety in school to restrict the availability of these awful assault weapon to pass the brady hill and at least require people to have criminal background check before get a gun and to say if be not old enough to vote and be not old enough to go to war ought not to own a handgun and ought not to use unless be on a target range want to pass a health care bill that will make drug treatment available for everyone and also have to do have to have drug treatment and education available to everyone and especially those who be in prison who be come out have a drug czar now in lee|brown who be the police chief of atlanta of houston of new|york who understand these thing and when the congress come back next|year will be move forward on that need this crime bill now ought to give to the american people for christmas and need to move forward on all these other front but say to fellow americans need some other thing as well do not believe can repair the basic fabric of society until people who be willing to work have work work organize life give structure and discipline to life give meaning and self esteem to people who be parent give a role model to child the famous african american sociologist william|julius|wilson have write a stunning book call the|truly|disadvantage in which chronicle in breathtake term how the inner city of country have crumble as work have disappear and must find a way through public and private source to enhance the attractiveness of the american people who live there to get investment there can not submit to repair the american community and restore the american family until provide the structure the value the discipline and the reward that work give read a wonderful speech the|other|day give at howard|university in a lecture series fund by bill and camille|cosby in which the speaker say grow up in anacostia|years|ago even then be all black and be a very poor neighborhood but know when be a child in anacostia a african american neighborhood a very poor neighborhood have a crime rate that be low than the average of the crime rate of city why because have coherent family have coherent community the people who fill the church on sunday live in the same place go to church the guy that own the drugstore live clown the street the person that own the grocery store live in community be whole and say to have to make people whole again this church have stand for that why do think have member in this country because people know be fill with the spirit of god to do the right thing in this life by so say to have to make a partnership all the government agency all the business folk but where there be no family where there be no order where there be no hope where be reduce the size of armed service because have win the cold war who will be there to give structure discipline and love to these child must do that and must help scripture say 's be the salt of the earth and the light of the world that if light shin before man will give glow to the father in heaven that be what must do that be what must do how would explain to martin|luther|king if show up today and say yes win the cold war yes the big threat that all of grow up under communism and nuclear war communism go nuclear war receding yes develop all these miraculous technology yes all have get a vcr in home be interesting yes get channel on the cable yes without regard to race if work hard and play by the rule can get into a service academy or a good college will do just great how would explain to all these kid get kill and kill each other how would justify the thing that permit that no other country in the world would permit how could explain that give people the freedom to succeed and create condition in which million abuse that freedom to destroy the thing that make life worth live and life can not and so say to today fellow americans give this job and be make progress on the thing hire to do but unless deal with the ravage of crime and drug and violence and unless recognize that be due to the breakdown of the family the community and the disappearance of job and unless say some of this can not be do by government because have to reach deep inside to the value the spirit the soul and the truth of human nature none of the other thing seek to do will ever take where need to go so in this pulpit on this|day let ask all of in heart to say will honor the life and the work of martin|luther|king will honor the meaning of church will somehow by god 's grace will turn this around will give these child a future will take away gun and give book will take away despair and give hope will rebuild the family and the neighborhood and the community will not make all the work that have go on here benefit just a few will do together by the grace of god thank view transcript transcript fellow americans today want to talk with about nation 's military involvement in somalia a|year|ago all watch with horror as somali child and family lay die by the|tens|of|thousand die the slow agonize death of starvation a starvation bring on not only by drought but also by the anarchy that then prevail in that country this|past|weekend all react with anger and horror as an armed somali gang desecrate the body of american soldier and display a capture american pilot all of soldier who be take part in an international effort to end the starvation of the somali people these tragic event raise hard question about effort in somalia why be still there what be try to accomplish how do a humanitarian mission turn violent and when will people come home these question deserve straight answer let start by remember why troop go into somalia in the first place go because only the|united|states could help stop of the great human tragedy of this time a|third of a people have die of starvation and disease twice that many more be at risk of die meanwhile ton of relief supply pile up in the capital of mogadishu because a small number of somalis stop food from reach own countryman conscience say enough in nation 's good tradition take action with bipartisan support president bush send in american troop as part of a united|nation humanitarian mission troop create a secure environment so that food and medicine could get through save close|to|one|million life and throughout most of somalia everywhere but in mogadishu life begin return to normal crop be grow market be reopen so be school and hospital nearly|a|million somalis still depend completely on relief supply but at least the starvation be go and none of this would have happen without american leadership and america 's troop until june thing go well with little violence the|united|states reduce troop presence from down to less|than|5,000 with other nation pick up where leave off but then in june the people who cause much of the problem in the beginning start attack american pakistani and other troop who be there just to keep the peace rather than participate in build the peace with other these people seek to fight and to disrupt even if mean return somalia to anarchy and mass famine and make no mistake about if be to leave somalia tomorrow other nation would leave too chaos would resume the relief effort would stop and starvation soon would return that knowledge have lead to continue mission be not job to rebuild somalia 's society or even to create a political process that can allow somalia 's clan to live and work in peace the somalis must do that for the|united|nation and many african state be more than willing to help but in the|united|state must decide whether will give enough time to have a reasonable chance to succeed start this mission for the right reason and be go to finish in the right way in a sense come to somalia to rescue innocent people in a burn house have nearly put the fire out but some smolder ember remain if leave now those ember will reignite into flame and people will die again if stay a short while longer and do the right thing have get a reasonable chance of cool off the ember and get other firefighter to take place also have to recognize that can not leave now and still have all troop present and account for and want to know that be determined to work for the security of those americans miss or hold captive anyone hold an american fight now should understand above all else that will hold strictly responsible for soldier ' well being expect to be well treat and expect to be release so now face a choice do leave when the job get tough or when the job be well do do invite a return of mass suffering or do leave in a way that give the somalis a decent chance to survive recently general colin|powell say this about choice in somalia because thing get difficult do not cut and rim work the problem and try to find a correct solution want to bring troop home from somalia before the event of this|week as say have already reduce the number of troop there from to must complete that withdrawal soon and will but must also leave on term must do right and here be what intend to do 's event make clear that even as prepare to withdraw from somalia need more strength there need more armor more air power to ensure that people be safe and that can do job today have order additional army troop and additional armored vehicle to somalia to protect troop and to complete mission have also order an aircraft carrier and amphibious group with combat marines to be station offshore these force will be under american command mission what be ask these young americans to do be the follow first be there to protect troop and basis do not go to somalia with a military purpose never want to kill anyone but those who attack soldier must know will pay a very heavy price second be there to keep open and secure the road the port and the line of communication that be essential for the|united|nation and the relief worker to keep the flow of food and supply and people move freely throughout the country so that starvation and anarchy do not return third be there to keep the pressure on those who cut off relief supply and attack people not to personalize the conflict but to prevent a return to anarchy fourth through pressure and presence troop will help to make possible for the somali people work with other to reach agreement among so that can solve problem and survive when leave that be mission be propose this plan because will let finish leave somalia on own term and without destroy all that administration have accomplish there for if be to leave today know what would happen within month somali child again would be die in the street own credibility with friend and ally would be severely damage leadership in world affair would be undermine at the very time when people be look to america to help promote peace and freedom in the post - cold war world and all around the world aggressor thug and terrorist will conclude that the good way to get to change policy be to kill people would be open season on americans that be why be commit to get this job do in somalia not only quickly but also effectively to do that be take step to ensure troop from other nation be ready to take the place of own soldier have already withdraw troop and more than that number have replace from over|two|dozen other nation now will intensify effort to have other country deploy more troop to somalia to assure that security will remain when be go and will complete the replacement of u.s. military logistic personnel with civilian contractor who can provide the same support to the|united|nation while be take military step to protect own people and to help the u.n. maintain a secure environment must pursue new diplomatic effort to help the somalis find a political solution to problem that be the only kind of outcome that can endure for fundamentally the solution to somalia 's problem be not a military be political leader of the neighboring african state such as ethiopia and eritrea have offer to take the lead in effort to build a settlement among the somali people that can preserve order and security have direct representative to pursue such effort vigorously and have ask ambassador bob|oakley who serve effectively in administration as representative in somalia to travel again to the region immediately to advance this process obviously even then there be no guarantee that somalia will rid of violence and suffering but at least will have give somalia a reasonable chance somalis take to the street to express sympathy for loss to thank for effort most somalis be not hostile to but grateful and want to use this opportunity to rebuild country be judgment and that of military adviser that may need up|to|6|months to complete these step and to conduct an orderly withdrawal will do what can to complete the mission before then all american troop will be out of somalia no later than march the 31st except for a|few|hundred support personnel in noncombat role if take these step if take the time to do the job right be convinced will have live up to the responsibility of american leadership in the word and will have prove that be committed to address the new problem of a new era when out troop in somalia come under fire this|last|weekend witness a dramatic example of the heroic ethic of american military when the first black|hawk helicopter be down this|weekend the other american troop do

bravery with which tell story be really what call all here tonight every of know someone who be work hard and play by the rule and still be hurt by this system that just do not work for too many people but would like to tell about just kerry|kennedy own a small furniture store that employ people in titusville florida like most small business owner be pour heart and soul sweat and blood into that business for year but over the|last|several|year again like most small business owner be see health care premium skyrocket even in year when no claim be make and last|year painfully discover could no longer afford to provide coverage for all worker because insurance company tell that of worker have become high risk because of advanced age the problem wit that those people be mother and father the people who found the business and still work in the store this story speak for million of other and from have learn a powerful truth have to preserve and strengthen what be right with the health care system but have get to fix what be wrong with now all know what be right be bless with the good health care professional on earth the fine health care institution the good medical research the most sophisticated technology mother be a nurse grow up around hospital doctor and nurse be the first professional people ever know or learn to look up to be what be right with this health care system but also know that can no longer afford to continue to ignore what be wrong million of americans be just a pink slip away from lose health insurance and serious illness away from lose all saving million more be lock into the job have now just because or someone in family have once be sick and have what be call the preexist condition and on any|given|day over|37|million americans most of work people and little child have no health insurance at all and in spite of all this medical bill be grow at over twice the rate of inflation and the|united|states spend over a third more of income on health care than any other nation on earth and the gap be grow cause many of company in global competition severe disadvantage there be no excuse for this kind of system know other people have do better know people in own country be do well have no excuse fellow americans must fix this system and have to begin with congressional action believe as strongly as can say that can reform the costliest and most wasteful system on the face of the earth without enact new broad base taxis believe because of the conversation have have with thousand of health care professional around the country with people who be outside this city but be inside expert on the way this system work and waste money the proposal that describe tonight borrow many of the principle and idea that have be embrace in plan introduce by both republicans and democrats in this congress for the first time in this|century leader of both political party have join together around the principle of provide universal comprehensive health care be a magic moment and must seize want to say to all of have be deeply move by the spirit of this debate by the openness of all people to new idea and argument and information the american people would proud to know that when a health care university be hold for member of congress just to try to give everybody the same amount of information over republicans and democrats sign up and show up for just to learn the basic fact of the complicated problem before both side be willing to say have listen to the people know the cost of go forward with this system be far great than the cost of change both side think understand the literal ethical imperative of do something about the system have now rise above these difficulty and past difference to solve this problem will go a long way toward define who be and who intend to be as a people in this difficult and challenging era believe all understand that and so tonight let ask all of every member of the house every member of the senate each republican and each democrat let keep this spirit and let keep this commitment until this job be do owe to the american people applause thank thank very much now if may would like to review the principle mention earlier and describe how think can best fulfill those principle first and most important security this principle speak to the human misery to the cost to the anxiety hear about every day all of when people talk about problem with the present system security mean that those who do not now have health care coverage will have and for those who have will never be take away must achieve that security as soon as possible under plan every american would receive a health care security card that will guarantee a comprehensive package of benefit over the course of an entire lifetime roughly comparable to the benefit package offer by most fortune company this health care security card will offer this package of benefit in a way that can never be take away so let agree on this whatever else disagree on before this congress finish work next|year will pass and will sign legislation to guarantee this security to every citizen of this country with this card if lose job or switch job be cover if leave job to start a small business be cover if be an early retiree be cover if someone in family have unfortunately have an illness that qualify as a preexist condition be still cover if get sick or a member of family get sick even if be a life threaten illness be cover and if an insurance company try to drop for any reason will still be cover because that will be illegal this card will give comprehensive coverage will cover people for hospital care doctor visit emergency and lab service diagnostic service like pap smear and mammogram and cholesterol test substance abuse and mental health treatment and equally important for both health care and economic reason this program for the first time would provide a broad range of preventive service include regular checkup and well baby visit now be just common sense know any family doctor will tell that people will stay healthy and long term cost of the health system will be low if have comprehensive preventive service know how all of mother tell that an ounce of prevention be worth a pound of cure mother be right and be a lesson like so many lesson from mother that have wait too long to live by be time to start do health care security must also apply to old americans this be something imagine all of in this room feel very deeply about the first thing want to say about that be that must maintain the medicare program work to provide that kind of security but this time and for the first time believe medicare should provide coverage for the cost of prescription drug yes will cost some more in the beginning but again any physician who deal with the elderly will tell that there be thousand of elderly people in every state who be not poor enough to be on medicaid but just above that line and on medicare who desperately need medicine who make decision every|week between medicine and food any doctor who deal with the elderly will tell that there be many elderly people who do not get medicine who get sicker and sicker and eventually go to the doctor and wind up spend more money and drain more money from the health care system than would if have regular treatment in the way that only adequate medicine can provide also believe that over time should phase in long term care for the disabled and the elderly on a comprehensive basis as proceed with this health care reform can not forget that the most rapidly grow percentage of americans be those over can not break faith with have to do better by the second principle be simplicity heath care system must be simple for the patient and simple for those who actually deliver health care doctor nurse other medical professional today have more|than|1,500 insurer with hundreds|and|hundred of different form no other nation have a system like this these form be time consume for health care provider be expensive for health care consumer be exasperate for anyone who be ever try to sit down around a table and wade through and figure out the medical care industry be literally drown in paperwork in recent|years the number of administrator in hospital have grow by time the rate that the number of doctor have grow a hospital ought to be a house of healing not a monument to paperwork and bureaucracy just|a|few|days|ago the vice president and have the honor of visit the|children's|hospital here in washington where do wonderful often miraculous thing for very sick child a nurse name debbie|freiberg tell that be in the cancer and bone marrow unit the|other|day a little boy ask just to stay at side during chemotherapy and have to walk away from that child because have be instruct to go to yet another class to learn how to fill out another form for something that do not have a lick to do with the health care of the child be help that be wrong and can stop and ought to do meet a very compelling doctor name lillian|beard a pediatrician who say that do not get into profession to spend hours|and|hour some doctor up|to|25|hour a week — just fill out form tell become a doctor to keep child well and to help save those who get sick can relieve people like of this burden learn the vice president and do that in the|washington|children's|hospital alone the administrator tell spend a year in hospital fill out form that have nothing whatever to do with keep up with the treatment of the patient and the doctor there applaud when be tell and relate to that spend so much time fill out paperwork that if only have to fill out those paperwork requirement necessary to monitor the heath of the child each doctor on that hospital staff of could see another child a year that is child a year think can save money in this system if simplify and can make the doctor and the nurse and the people that be give life to help all be healthy a whole lot happy too on job under proposal there would be standard insurance form not hundred of will simplify also and must — the government 's rule and regulation because be a big part of this problem this be of those case where the physician should heal thyself have to reinvent the way relate to the health care system along with reinvent government a doctor should not have to check with a bureaucrat in an office thousands|of|mil away before order a simple blood test that be not right and can change and doctor nurse and consumer should not have to worry about the fine print if have this simple form there will not be any fine print people will know what mean the third principle be saving reform must produce saving in this health care system have to be spend over of income on health care canada 's at nobody else be over be compete with all these people for the future and the other major country cover everybody and cover with service as generous as the good company policy here in this country rampant medical inflation be eat away at wage saving investment capital ability to create new job in the private sector and this public treasury know the budget just adopt have steep cut in defense a freeze on the discretionary spending so critical to reeducate america and invest in job and help to convert from a defense to a domestic economy but pass a budget which have medicaid increase of between|16 and percent a year over the|next|5|years and medicare increase of between|11 and percent in an environment where assume inflation will be at or less can not continue to do this competitiveness whole economy the integrity of the way the government work and ultimately living standard depend upon ability to achieve saving without harm the quality of heath care unless do this worker will lose in income each|year by the|end|of|the|decade small business will continue to face skyrocketing premium and a full third of small business now cover employee say will be force to drop insurance large corporation will bear big disadvantage in global competition and health care cost devour more and more and more of budget pretty soon all of or the people who succeed will be show up here and write out check for health care and interest on the debt and worry about whether have get enough defense and that will be unless have the courage to achieve the saving that be plainly there before every state and local government will continue to cut back on everything from education to law enforcement to pay more and more for the same health care these rise cost be a special nightmare for small business the engine of entrepreneurship and job creation in america today health care premium for small business be high than those of large corporation today and will keep rise at double digit rate unless act so how will achieve these saving rather than look at price control or look away as the price spiral continue rather than use the heavy hand of government to try to control what be happen or continue to ignore what be happen believe there be a third way to achieve these saving first to give group of consumer and small business the same market bargaining power that large corporation and large group of public employee now have want to let market force enable plan to compete want to force these plan to compete on the basis of price and quality not simply to allow to continue make money by turn people away who be sick or old or perform mountain of unnecessary procedure but also believe should back this system up with limit on how much plan can raise premium year in and year out force people again to continue to pay more for the same health care without regard to inflation or the rise population need want to create what have be miss in this system for too long and what every successful nation who have deal with this problem have already have to do to have a combination of private market force and a sound public policy that will support that competition but limit the rate at which price can exceed the rate of inflation and population growth if the competition do not work especially in the early going the second thing want to say be that unless everybody be cover and this be a very important thing unless everybody be cover will never be able to fully put the brake on health care inflation why be that because when people do not have any health insurance still get health care but get when be too late when be too expensive often from the most expensive place of all the emergency room usually by the time show up illness be more severe and mortality rate be much high in hospital than those who have insurance so cost more and what else happen since get the care but do not pay who do pay all the rest of pay in high hospital bill and high insurance premium this cost shifting be a major problem the third thing can do to save money be simply by simplify the system what have already discuss free the health care provider from these costly and unnecessary paperwork and administrative decision will save tens|of|billions|of|dollar spend twice as much as any other major country do on paperwork spend at least a dime on the dollar more than any other major country that be a stunning statistic be something that every republican and every democrat ought to be able to say agree that be go to squeeze this out can not tolerate this this have nothing to do with keep people well or help when be sick should invest the money in something else also have to crack down on fraud and abuse in the system that drain billions|of|dollar a year be a very large figure accord to every health care expert have ever speak with so believe can achieve large saving and that large saving can be use to cover the unemployed uninsured and will be use for people who realize those saving in the private sector to increase ability to invest and grow to hire new worker or to give worker pay raise many of for the first time in year now nobody have to take word for this can ask dr. koop be up here with tonight and thank for be here since leave distinguished tenure as surgeon general have spend an enormous amount of time study health care system how operate what be right and wrong with say could spend every|year more|than|20|percent of the total budget without sacrifice the high quality of american medicine ask the public employee in california who have hold own premium down by adopt the same strategy that want every american to be able to adopt bargain within the limit of a strict budget ask|xerox which save per worker on health insurance premium ask the staff of who all agree provide some of the fine health care in the world be hold cost increase to less|than|half the national average ask the people of hawaii the only state that cover virtually all of citizen and have still be able to keep cost below the national average people may disagree over the good way to fix this system may all disagree about how quickly can do the thing that have to do but can not disagree that can find tens|of|billions|of|dollar in saving in what be clearly the most costly and the most bureaucratic system in the entire world and have to do something about that and have to do now the fourth principle be choice americans believe ought to be able to choose own health care plan and keep own doctor and think all of agree under any plan pass ought to have that right but today under broken heath care system in spite of the rhetoric of choice the fact be that that power be slip away for more and more americans of course be usually the employer not the employee who make the initial choice of what health care plan the employee will be in and if employer offer only|one plan as nearly|three quarter of small or medium sized firm do today be stick with that plan and the doctor that cover propose to give every american a choice among high quality plan can stay with current doctor join a network of doctor and hospital or join a health maintenance organization if do not like plan every year will have a chance to choose a new one the choice will be leave to the american citizen the worker not the boss and certainly not some government bureaucrat also believe that doctor should have a choice as to what plan practice in otherwise citizen may have own choice limit want to end the discrimination that be now grow against doctor and to permit to practice in several different plan choice be important for doctor and be absolutely critical for consumer have get to have in whatever plan pass the fifth principle be quality if reform everything else in health care but fail to preserve and enhance the high quality of medical care will have take a step backward not forward quality be something that simply can not leave to chance when board an airplane feel better know that the plane have to meet standard design to protect safety and can not ask any less of health care system proposal will create report card on health plan so that consumer can choose the high quality health care provider and reward with business at the same time plan will track quality indicator so that doctor can make well and smart choice of the kind of care provide have evidence that more efficient delivery of health care do not decrease quality in fact may enhance let just give example of commonly perform procedure the coronary bypass operation pennsylvania discover that patient who be charge for this surgery receive as good or well care as patient who be charge for the same procedure in the same state high price simply do not always equal good quality plan will guarantee that high quality information be available in even the most remote area of this country so that can have high quality service link rural doctor for example with hospital with high tech urban medical center and plan will ensure the quality of continue progress on a whole range of issue by speed research on effective prevention and treatment measure for cancer for aids for alzheimer 's for heart disease and for other chronic disease have to safeguard the fine medical research establishment in the entire world and will do that with this plan indeed will even make well the sixth and final principle be responsibility need to restore a sense that be all in this together and that all have a responsibility to be a part of the solution responsibility have to start with those who profit from the current system responsibility mean insurance company should no longer be allow to cast people aside when get sick should apply to laboratory that submit fraudulent bill to lawyer who abuse malpractice claim to doctor who order unnecessary procedure mean drug company should no longer charge time more per prescription drug make in america here in the|united|state than charge for the same drug overseas in short responsibility should apply to anybody who abuse this system and drive up the cost for honest hard work citizen and undermine confidence in the honest gifted health care provider have responsibility also mean change some behavior in this country that drive up cost like crazy and without change will never bare the system ought to have will never let just mention a few and start with the most important the outrageous cost of violence in this country stein in large measure from the fact that this be the only country in the world where teenager can rout the street at random with semiautomatic weapon and be better armed than the police but let not kid be not that simple also have high rate of aids of smoking and excessive drinking of teen pregnancy of low birth weight baby and have the third bad immunization rate of any nation in the|western|hemisphere have to change way if ever really want to be healthy as a people and have an affordable health care system and no one can deny that but let say this and hope every american will listen because this be not an easy thing to hear — responsibility in health care system be not just about be about be about be about each of too many of have not take responsibility for own health care and for own relation to the health care system many of who have have fully pay health care plan have use the system whether need or not without think what the cost be many people who use this system do not pay a|penny for care even though can afford to think those who do not have any health insurance should be responsible for pay a portion of new coverage there can not be any something for nothing and have to demonstrate that to people this be not a free system even small contribution as small as the when visit a doctor illustrate that this be something of value there be a cost to be not free and want to tell that believe that all of should have insurance why should the rest of pick up the tab when a guy who do not think need insurance or say can not afford get in an accident wind up in an emergency room get good care and everybody else pay why should the small business people who be struggle to keep afloat and take care of employee have to pay to maintain this wonderful health care infrastructure for those who refuse to do anything if be go to produce a well health care system for every of every of be go to have to do part there can not be any such thing as a free ride have to pay for have to pay for tonight want to say plainly how think should do that most of the money will come under way of thinking as do today from premium pay by employer and individual that be the way happen today but under this health care security plan every employer and every individual will be ask to contribute something to health care this concept be first convey to the congress about|20|years|ago by president nixon and today a lot of people agree with the concept of share responsibility between employer and employee and that the good thing to do be to ask every employer and every employee to share that the|chamber|of|commerce have say that and be not in the business of hurt small business the|american|medical|association have say that some call an employer mandate but think be the fair way to achieve responsibility in the heath care system and be the easy for ordinary americans to understand because build on what already have and what already work for so many americans be the reform that be not only easy to understand but easy to implement in a way that be fair to small business because can give a discount to help struggle small business meet the cost of cover employee should require the east bureaucracy or disruption and create the cooperation need to make the system cost conscious even as expand coverage and should do in a way that do not cripple small business and low wage worker every employer should provide coverage just as quarter do now those that pay be pick up the tab for those who do not today do not think that be right to finance the rest of reform can achieve new saving as have outline in both the|federal|government and the private sector through well decision make and increase competition and will impose new taxis on tobacco do not think that should be the only source of revenue believe should also ask for a modest contribution from big employer who opt out of the system to make up for what those who be in the system pay for medical research for health education center for all the subsidy to small business for all the thing that everyone else be contribute to but between those thing believe can pay for this package of benefit and universal coverage and a subsidy program that will help small business these source can cover the cost of the proposal that have describe tonight subject the number in proposal to the scrutiny of not only all the major agency in government — know a lot of people do not trust but would be interesting for the american people to know that this be the first time that the financial expert on health care in all of the different government agency have ever be require to sit in the room together and agree on number have never happen before but obviously that be not enough so then give these number to actuary from major accounting firm and major fortune company who have no stake in this other than to see that effort succeed so believe number be good and achievable now what do this mean to an individual american citizen some will be ask to pay more if be an employer and be not insure worker at all will have to pay more but if be a small business with fewer|than|50 employee will get a subsidy if be a firm that provide only very limited coverage may have to pay more but some firm will pay the same or less for more coverage if be a young single person in twenty and be already insure rate may go up somewhat because be go to go into a big pool with middle aged people and old people and want to enable people to keep insurance even when someone in family get sick but think that be fair because when the young get old will benefit from first and secondly even those who pay a little more today will benefit year from now by bring health care cost closer to inflation over the long run can all win but some will have to pay more in the short run nevertheless the vast majority of the americans watch this tonight will pay the same or less for health care coverage that will be the same or well than the coverage have tonight that be the central reality if currently get health insurance through job under plan still will and for the first time everybody will get to choose from among at|least|three plan to belong to if be a small business owner who want to provide health insurance to family and employee but can not afford because the system be stack against this plan will give a discount that will finally make insurance affordable if be already provide insurance rate may well drop because will help as a small business person join thousand of other to get the same benefit big corporation get at the same price get those benefit if be self employ will pay less and will get to deduct from taxis of health care premium if be a large employer health care cost will not go up as fast so that will have more money to put into high wage and new job and to put into the work of be competitive in this tough global economy now these fellow americans be the principle on which think should base effort security simplicity saving choice quality and responsibility these be the guide star that should follow on journey toward health care reform over the|coming|months will be bombard with information from all kind of source there will be some who will stoutly disagree with what have propose and with all other plan in the congress for that matter and some of the argument will be genuinely sincere and enlightening other may simply be scare tactic by those who be motivate by the self interest have in the waste the system now generate because that waste be provide job income and money for some people ask only to think of this when hear all of these argument ask whether the cost of stay on this same course be not great than the cost of change and ask when hear the argument whether the argument be in interest or someone else 's this be something have get to try to do together want also to say to the representatives in congress have a special duty to look beyond these argument ask instead to look into the eye of the sick child who need care to think of the face of the woman who be be tell not only that condition be malignant but not cover by insurance to look at the bottom line of the business drive to bankruptcy by health care cost to look at the for sale sign in front of the home of family who have lose everything because of health care cost ask to remember the kind of people meet over the|last|year|and|a|half the elderly couple in new|hampshire that break down and cry because of shame at have an empty refrigerator to pay for drag a woman who lose a job that use to support child because young child be so ill that could not keep health insurance and the only way to get care for the child be to get public assistance a young couple that have a sick child and could only get insurance from of the parent ' employer that be a nonprofit corporation with employee and so have to face the question of whether to let this poor person with a sick child go or raise the premium of every employee in the firm by and on and on and on know have difference of opinion but be here tonight in a spirit that be animate by the problem of those people and by the sheer knowledge that if can look into heart will not be able to say that the great nation in the history of the world be powerless to confront this crisis history and heritage tell that can meet this challenge everything about america 's past tell will do so say to let write that new chapter in the american story let guarantee every american comprehensive health benefit that can never be take away know in spite of all the work have do together and all the progress have make there be still a lot of people who say would be an outright miracle if pass health care reform but fellow americans in a time of change have to have miracle and miracle do happen mean just a few day ago see a simple handshake shatter decade of deadlock in the|middle|east have see the wall crumble in berlin and south|africa see the ongoing brave struggle of the people of russia to seize freedom and democracy and now be turn to strike a blow for freedom in this country the freedom of americans to live without fear that own nation 's health care system will not be there for when need be hard to believe that there be once a time in this|century when that kind of fear grip old age when retirement be nearly synonymous with poverty

america in the|last|99|days have work relentlessly to address the pressing and long ignore need of the american people and to bring to the government something have not see in a long time an acknowledgment that bold action be need and need now to secure and enlarge america 's future and that in order to do not only have to change program have to change the way the government work and engage the energy of the american people in the process in the|last|100|day think have begin to change the direction in which country have be go for a long time and to go toward a new direction more like the one the american people demand last|november have also start an unprecedented debate in nation 's capital about big idea and well life across nation idea that in many case be shape and nurture by some of the people who be here today as senator breaux say earlier the member of the|democratic|leadership|council of which be proud to be a found member unlike most organization the dlc have do more than just talk about the problem in country have make an honest effort to develop real idea about how to restore the american economy and make the government work and rebuild the confidence and the link that exist between the american people and government when thing be at good here and be be a laboratory for experimentation and solution during year with the dlc really try to refine philosophy of what would mean to take not only but in a new direction to make country work again and to reward work and family to encourage education and enterprise to establish what have often call a new covenant with the american people create opportunity but demand responsibility from all so that once again could be a true american community where know and believe and live as if be all in this together this group have conceive many of the idea that have advocate since have be in washington from set a limit on welfare and put people to work to police reform and community policing to rewarding work of low income work people by have an earn income tax credit that would lift the work poor with child out of poverty so could say if work 40|hour a week in this country have a child in the house ought not to be poor these be the kind of thing that this organization have do help to develop the idea want to talk to today about that have so much to do with the future of the young people here and throughout country national service this be an organization about idea now in washington as may imagine do not always agree with another and that be good that be why have get a system where the government 's divide up and have party and have people fight all the time as long as be about idea but too often have see that the debate over big idea get mire in petty politic know thing the american people be tired of gridlock and petty politic if be go to fight want to fight over idea and the future of this country in the|past|99|day try to address the problem the american people tell want to be address focus more than anything else on the economy pass the outline of a budget that will reduce the deficit by more|than|$500|billion increase investment in education and technology and the thing that will create the economy of the|21st|century that all of need so that will have good and decent job and a decent future lay the groundwork for a|more|prosperous|tomorrow just|in|100|day have announce a policy to help to convert the defense cutback and the economic opportunity for people who be lose job because of the military cutback to take a new direction in technology to create more opportunity for people to be more aggressive in preserve the environment but do in a way that create job not a way that cost job to have a trade policy that will really reflect common interest with other nation and expand job and opportunity everywhere have begin the long overdue renovation of the american economic base the question now unlike the question be now not whether be go to reduce the deficit but how and how much the question now be not whether the government will have a new partnership with the private sector to shape the economy but exactly what the detail will be and how much part will be have also take on the issue of health care something of americans cry out for last|year get a letter today from a young woman shake hand with whose literally life be on the line and can not get health insurance be wrong that in this nation be the only advanced country in the world with people without health insurance be wrong that million of americans can not change job without lose health insurance because or a child or a spouse have be sick be wrong that the price of health care go up time the rate of inflation every|year and be wrong that spend more of income than any other country on earth on health care and have less to show for but be also wrong to assume that there be some magic quick answer that be why have be work with a task force head by the first lady and over people from all aspect of health care to do something about this but now for the american people the issue be no longer whether be go to address the health care crisis whether be go to provide security to hard work middle class americans whether be go to cover the people who be not cover whether be go to control cost but how be go to do and how fast and when be go to begin hope the answer be soon and not too soon be soon enough for there be a lot of discussion last|year about how bad the government be and do not work and be bloated need a change look at the|last|100|day have try to set an example by offer a budget to reduce the white|house staff by by put the lid on and reduce the federal bureaucratic expense the administrative expense of the|federal|government by over|$10|billion by move dramatically to reduce the influence of special interest on executive|branch appointment by have the tough ethic law and restriction on people become lobbyist for other interest when leave the payroll of the president of the|united|state by ask the vice president to share the most sweeping review of the way work in a generation with a promise of real reform and reinvent government something else this organization have long believe in be move and the congress be move to join the congress have vote to cut the administrative cost of run the congress something many of never think would see happen do that the|house|of|representative vote yesterday to give the president of the|united|state a modify line item veto and hope the senate will follow lead hope soon will send to desk the motor voter bill which will make easy for young people and other people to vote and participate in country 's political process and there will be campaign finance reform and lobby reform legislation and a crime bill that will put more police on the street and give the capacity need to take community back these thing be go on the question be no longer whether be go to reform the way government work but how fast and how much and how well and those be the right question fellow americans good question to ask and now come to the last and in many way the most important issue that have try to address the economy yes health care yes reform in the way the government work yes — but also what about the american people how can each american make a contribution how can each american do the work that all americans must take responsibility for or and grow up into a vibrant community have try to address those issue as well the buzz word now people use be empowerment use to call responsibility often have say and want to reiterate today the|united|states|government can not create an opportunity for anyone who will not be responsible enough to seize opportunity be a way street and require responsibility that be the only way will ever rebuild the american community in the|day and month ahead will see the secretary of education talk about remarkable education program to provide tough national standard in education but also to give people at the grass root level more flexibility in make public education work will see the secretary of agriculture and the secretary of housing|and|urban|development talk about how can empower even the poor americans to start own business save own money and take control of own future will see other people talk about how can reform the welfare system all of these thing be at the core of the notion that ought to make possible for every american to live up to the full of or godgiven ability and that be what in the end national service be all about help and help each other at the same time on this|100th|day of administration want to recommit and those who work with to the value that have make nation without peer in all human history those of opportunity responsibility community and respect for another today want to propose apply those value to a revolution of opportunity for hard press family and for those who have be leave out as a first step be go to ease the term of college loan help student from middle and lower middle income family to clear a major path to the american dream the path of high education in return will demand responsibility from young people will make easy to borrow money and much easy to pay off but this time have to pay off can not just default on the loan and will also offer the young people of america the opportunity of pay loan back by serve community in a new program of national service in just|a|few|day will send to the congress bill contain proposal first to strengthen college opportunity and to establish national service together will revive america 's commitment to community and make affordable the cost of a college education for every american be no secret that over the cost of a college education be about the only essential think that be go up even more rapidly than health care cost and middle class parent and even upper middle class parent not to mention low income people have bear the burden pay now about|five|percent of median income just to put child through a|4|year in state public college cost an average of over|$5,200 a year for that education that mean family be deplete saving and many student be face with cut back to a part time course load or have to drop out simply because of the cost of a college education a college dropout be now more than twice the high school dropout rate can not afford that and can do better propose a new way to finance college for million of student who seek loan every|year call an excel account with student can repay the loan take out not with a percentage of the loan borrow but with a percentage of actual earning now think about that for student drive by debt into career with high pay and low satisfaction this can be very liberating take a student tear for example between pursue a career in teaching and corporate law this student now can at least make the career choice base on what or want to do and not the size of the outstanding student loan because propose to let everybody have the option of pay the student loan back base on how much earn not just how much owe that be an incredible incentive however under the current system as many of know student face with big bill or just inconvenient responsibility have too often take the irresponsible route and default on loan or have be find in default because could not find a job often time there be no serious effort to collect the loan because the government guarantee of so if the bank make the loan cost more|than|10|percent to go collect what be the result the taxpayer every year pay about|$3|billion on other people 's loan money that could be spend on education on the school here on the future of the child here just for bad loan be not right under system the|department|of|education would engage the|internal|revenue|service would have the payroll record and would not be able to beat the bill because would have to pay the loan back as a percentage of income if choose but would have to pay because pay taxis and because have record and because will not be able to get out of and that be the right thing to do but these excel account be just the beginning hope will lead more and more americans not only to seize the opportunity of a college education and to exert a strong sense of responsibility but also to seek to serve community through a program of national service be thomas|jefferson who first tell the american people in essence that the more know the more owe in word and quote a debt of service be due from every man to country proportion to the bounty which nature and fortune have measure to this statement remind that value never go out of fashion that civic responsibility be as good for democracy today as be when thomas|jefferson say that and that if really want to be the good citizen of country have to give something back to country with national service can literally open a new world to a new generation of americans where high learning go hand in hand with the high purpose of address unmet need educational social environmental need to secure the future that all will share national service will mark the start of a new era for america in which every citizen every of can become an agent of change arm with the knowledge and experience that a college education bring and ready to transform the world in which live city by city community by community block by block say to need know there be a lot of talk in america today and spend hour every week worry about the effect that automation and technology be have on employment indeed as see the productivity of american enterprise rise need for worker go down because can do more with compute that use to do with people so people ask all the time where will find the job for this new generation of americans how can drive this unemployment rate down but if look around this country at all the human problem all the homeless people all the environmental waste dump in city and rural area all the problem that have get in every community in america and see all the kid that be in trouble—15 of at risk and need somebody to pay attention to — know where the work need to be late|last|night when be prepare to come down here take a little time off at desk and read the letter that staff have give and get a letter from a woman who grow up with have know here since be in grade school in this letter say know someone ask a|couple|of|days|ago how be go to save all these kid in this country that be in trouble and say without even think blurt out the same way lose at a time and so today fellow americans issue a call to national service to americans young and old democrats and republicans white black hispanic asian and name all of that make up this great nation call to national service because be only that together can advance a tradition root in people 's history help people to help and with national service can rejoin the citizen in community of this country bond each to the other with the glue of common purpose and real patriotism have many young people here today student of this place of high learning where be gather in know see the builder of tomorrow and say to as good as the education be here and at the other great institution represent here today and all across america the power of academic learning be incomplete unless every american can share in that be the only way can lift whole country up say to further that country need need knowledge and initiative and energy need because be still strip and free of the cynicism that have paralyze too many of parent and grandparent and lead to spend too much time talk about what can not do instead of seize what can be not afflict by that and pray never will be need to make sure that can use energy and talent way be by make sure that the low wage that public service often offer will not be a route to the poorhouse for someone with college loan as say be go to make easy for to pay off college loan but also if engage in national service will make easy for to pay off a college debt or to earn credit toward before go to college or while be in college for each term of service or year participant in national service program will receive benefit that can be use toward past present or future obligation whether for college or advanced job training can get a college education and in addition through service perhaps the good experience of life that be a pretty good investment have talk a lot about the student here and do play a large part in this plan but be not alone here in many of already know what mean to make a difference in community because have just be do that for a long time and be very proud as say be go to get another cheer about this but of the model that have a little something to do with be the|delta|service|corps and appreciate what be do applause there be people here work to restore housing there be people here work in other way just want to mention lawrence|williams a team leader in the corps who have help to restore housing for low income people with the local habitat|for|humanity|project jane|sullivan a retire public schoolteacher and a former vista volunteer who help rural community gain well access to health care housing and other assistance and a young person meet just|a|few|moments|ago parris|moore brown who work with parent in housing program for drug awareness outreach and now plan to work with the physically challenge say that have no tolerance for self pity and live what preach have not be slow by what birth deal a brittle bone disorder that have leave as an adult and by own measure tall where be stand up on here so can see after meeting with and the other young people today would say stand about|10|feet tall in america today there be tens|of|thousand of people like parris and jane and lawrence and those of who be here with these service program who be die to be call to a new season of service and want to do that another part of plan be to build on the|national|and|community|service|act that be pass in and the already flourish program that be start and up and go in every state in this country national service be not go to be a federal bureaucracy be go to operate at the grass root with the real problem of real people and with the program that work today will be locally drive because trust the community in this country to make decision for also want to say that while want very much to have young people in this program who be work toward earn credit for college or pay college loan off through national service need so many other people in service project need old people who never will go back to college but have a lifetime of experience and energy to give to the young people of this country need young people who may not be old enough to drive a car or to qualify for this program but can have a dramatic impact on fellow student by help learn well study habit or just keep out of trouble have learn already that as the parent of a teenager that the peer can have a big impact on the shape and quality of a child 's life even a child can serve in program that now begin as early as kindergarten have no upper age limit in america or low age limit for be a good public servant to be successful this national program will need the broad base support of all the american people parent and child church and synagogue college and university and the potential provider and the beneficiary of service in this vision of national service everyone be a partner and that include of course the business community in this country need business to contribute to the effort to match federal money and local program and to contribute at the national level help to make sure that the program choose be good one indeed what will set this legislation apart from other similar effort in the past that reward service to country be that will totally eliminate the federal|government bureaucracy and believe no one will miss that be go to set up a national service corporation that will run like a big venture capital outfit not like a bureaucracy and community as say will have the flexibility to make own program work think that have see enough today and have hear enough of applause to know that the american people be hungry for a chance to serve country and to reap the reward of civic pride and education in the process in answer this call people be follow a proud history more|than|a|century|ago president abraham|lincoln sign the|homestead|act and the frontier of this country be settle by countless family who take up the challenge in exchange for to call own in the 's president roosevelt enlist million of young people to restore the environment

distinguish americans here as visitor in this chamber as be i. be nice to have a fresh excuse for give a long speech laughter when president speak to congress and the nation from this podium typically comment on the full range in challenge and opportunity that face the|united|state but this be not an ordinary time and for all the many task that require attention believe tonight call on to focus to unite and to act and that be economy for more than anything else task tonight as americans be to make economy thrive again let begin by say that have be too long at|least|three|decades since a president have come and challenge americans to join on a great national journey not merely to consume the bounty of today but to invest for a much great tomorrow like individual nation must ultimately decide how wish to conduct how wish to be think of by those with whom live and later how wish to be judge by history like every individual man and woman nation must decide whether be prepared to rise to the occasion history present have always be a people of youthful energy and dare spirit and at this historic moment as communism have fall as freedom be spread around the world as a global economy be take shape before eye americans have call for change and now be up to those of in this room to deliver for nation need a new direction tonight present to a comprehensive plan to set nation on that new course believe will find new direction in the basic old value that bring here over the|last|two|century a commitment to opportunity to individual responsibility to community to work to family and to faith must now break the habit of both political party and say there can be no more something for nothing and admit frankly that be all in this together the condition which bring as a nation to this point be well know two|decade of low productivity growth and stagnant wage persistent unemployment and underemployment year of huge government deficit and decline investment in future explode health care cost and lack of coverage for million of americans legion of poor child education and job training opportunity inadequate to the demand of this tough global economy for too long have drift without a strong sense of purpose or responsibility or community and political system so often have seem paralyze by special interest group by partisan bickering and by the sheer complexity of problem believe can do better because remain the great nation on earth the world 's strong economy the world 's only military superpower if have the vision the will and the heart to make the change must can still enter the|21st|century with possibility parent could not even have imagine and enter have secure the american dream for and for future generation well remember president reagan stand at this very podium and tell and the american people that if national debt be stack in dollar bill the stack would reach into space well today that stack would reach tell this not to assign blame for this problem there be plenty of blame to go around in both branch of the government and both party the time have come for the blame to end do not seek this office to place blame come here tonight to accept responsibility and want to accept responsibility with and if do right by this country do not care who get the credit for the plan offer have fundamental component first shift emphasis in public and private spending from consumption to investment initially by jumpstart the economy in the short term and invest in people job and income over the long run second change the rhetoric of the past into the action of the present by honor work and family in every part of public decision making third substantially reduce the federal deficit honestly and credibly by use in the beginning the most conservative estimate of government revenue not as the executive branch have do so often in the past use the most optimistic one and finally seek to earn the trust of the american people by pay for these plan first with cut in government waste and efficiency with cut not gimmick in government spending and by fairness for a change in the way additional burden be bear tonight want to talk with about what government can do because believe government must do more but let say first that the real engine of economic growth in this country be the private sector and second that each of must be an engine of growth and change the truth be that as government create more opportunity in this new and different time must also demand more responsibility in turn immediate priority must be to create job create job now some people say well be in a recovery and do not have to do that well all hope be in a recovery but be sure not create new job and there be no recovery worth salt that do not put the american people back to work to create job and guarantee a strong recovery call on congress to enact an immediate package of job investment of over|$30|billion to put people to work now to create a|half|a|million job job to rebuild highway and airport to renovate housing to bring new life to rural community and spread hope and opportunity among nation 's youth especially want to emphasize

people alone this|summer and tonight invite america 's business leader to join in this effort so that together can provide over summer job in city and poor rural area for young people second plan look beyond today 's business cycle because aspiration extend into the|next|century the heart of this plan deal with the long term be an investment program design to increase public and private investment in area critical to economic future and have a deficit reduction program that will increase the saving available for the private sector to invest will lower interest rate will decrease the percentage of the federal budget claim by interest payment and decrease the risk of financial market disruption that could adversely affect economy over the long run all this will bring a high rate of economic growth improved productivity more high quality job and an improve economic competitive position in the world in order to accomplish both increase investment and deficit reduction something no|american|government have ever be call upon to do at the same time before spending must be cut and taxis must be raise the spending cut recommend be carefully think through in a way to minimize any adverse economic impact to capture the peace dividend for investment purpose and to switch the balance in the budget from consumption to more investment the tax increase and the spending cut be both design to assure that the cost of this historic program to face and deal with problem will be bear by those who could readily afford the most plan be design furthermore and perhaps in some way most importantly to improve the health of american business through low interest rate more incentive to invest and better train worker because small business have create such a high percentage of all the new job in nation over plan include the bold target incentive for small business in history propose a permanent investment tax credit for the small firm in this country with revenue of under that be about|90|percent of the firm in america employ about|40|percent of the work force but create a big majority of the net new job for more|than|a|decade and propose new reward for entrepreneur who take new risk propose to give small business access to all the new technology of time and propose to attack this credit crunch which have deny small business the credit need to flourish and prosper with a new network of community development bank and to make the dream of enterprise zone real propose to bring new hope and new job to storefront and factory from south boston to south texas to south central los|angeles this plan invest in road bridge transit system in high speed railway and high tech information system and provide the most ambitious environmental cleanup in partnership with state and local government of time to put people to work and to preserve the environment for future stand as be on the edge of a|new|century know that economic growth depend as never before on open up new market overseas and expand the volume of world trade and so will insist on fair trade rule in international market as a part of a national economic strategy to expand trade include the successful completion of the late round of world trade talk and the successful completion of a north|american free trade agreement with appropriate safeguard for worker and for the environment at the same time and say this to in both party and across america tonight all the people who be listen be not enough to pass a budget or even to have a trade agreement this world be change so fast that must have aggressive target attempt to create the high wage job of the future that be what all competitor be do must give special attention to those critical industry that be go to explode in the|21st|century but that be in trouble in america today like aerospace must provide special assistance to area and to worker displace by cut in the defense budget and by other unavoidable economic dislocation and again will say must do this together pledge to that will do good to see that business and labor and government work together for a change but all of effort to strengthen the economy will fail — let say this again feel so strongly about this — all of effort to strengthen the economy will fail unless also take this|year not next|year not but this|year bold step to reform health care system in spend of income on health care more|than|30|percent more than any other country in the world and yet be the only advanced nation that do not provide a basic package of health care benefit to all of citizen unless change the present pattern of the growth in the deficit between|now|and|the|year|2000 will be in health care cost by the|year|2000 almost|20|percent of income will be in health care family will never be secure business will never be strong and government will never again be fully solvent until tackle the health care crisis must do this|year the combination of the rise cost of care and the lack of care and the fear of lose care be endanger the security and the very life of million of people and be weaken economy every day reduce health care cost can liberate literally hundreds|of|billions|of|dollars for new investment in growth and job bring health cost in line with inflation would do more for the private sector in this country than any tax cut could give and any spending program could promote reform health care over the long run be critically essential to reduce not only deficit but to expand investment in america later|this|spring after the first lady and the many good people who be help all across the country complete work will deliver to congress a comprehensive plan for health care reform that finally will bring cost under control and provide security to all of family so that no one will be deny the coverage need but so that economic future will not be compromise either will have to root out fraud and overcharge and make sure that paperwork no longer choke doctor will have to maintain the high american standard and the right to choose in a system that be the world 's fine for all those who can access but first must make choice must choose to give the american people the quality demand and deserve with a system that will not bankrupt the country or further drive more americans into agony let further say that want to work with all of on this realize this be a complicated issue but must address and believe if there be any chance that republicans and democrats who disagree on taxis and spending or anything else could agree on thing surely can all look at these number and go home and tell people the truth can not continue these spend pattern in public or private dollar for health care for less and less and less every year can do better and will work to do better perhaps the most fundamental change the new direction propose offer be focus on the future and investment which seek in child each day delay really make a commitment to child carry a dear cost half of the old in this country today do not receive the immunization need against deadly disease plan will provide for every eligible child and know now that will save for every spend by eliminate preventable childhood disease that be a good investment no matter how measure recommend that the woman infant and child 's nutrition program be expand so that every expectant mother who need the help get all know that head start a program that prepare child for school be a success story all know that save money but today just reach - third of all the eligible child under this plan every eligible child will be able to get a head start this be not just the right thing to do be the smart thing to do for every dollar invest today will save tomorrow have to start think about tomorrow have hear that somewhere before laughter have to ask more in school of student teacher principal parent yes must give the resource need to meet high standard but must also use the authority and the influence and the funding of the|education|department to promote strategy that really work in learning money alone be not enough have to do what really work to increase learn in school have to recognize that all of high school graduate need some further education in order to be competitive in this global economy so have to establish a partnership between business and education and the government for apprenticeship program in every state in this country to give people the skill need lifelong learning must benefit not just young high school graduate but worker too throughout career the average 18-year old today will change job time in a lifetime have do a lot in this country on worker training in the|last|few|year but the system be too fractured must develop a unified simplify sensible streamlined worker training program so that worker receive the training need regardless of why lose job or whether simply need to learn something new to keep have get to do better on this and finally propose a program that get a great response from the american people all across this country last|year a program of national service to make college loan available to all americans and to challenge at the same time to give something back to country as teacher or police officer or community service worker to give the option to pay the loan back but at tax time so can not beat the bill but to encourage instead to pay back by make country strong and make country better and give the benefit of knowledge a generation ago when president kennedy propose and the|united|stat congress embrace the|peace|corp define the character of a whole generation of americans commit to serve people around the world in this national service program will provide more than twice as many slot for people before go to college to be in national service than ever serve in the|peace|corp this program could do for this generation of members of congress what the land grant college act do and what the gi bill do for former congressmen in the future historian who get education through the national service loan will look back on and thank for give america a new lease on life if meet this challenge if believe in job and believe in learning must believe in rewarding work if believe in restore the value that make america special must believe that there be dignity in all work and there must be dignity for all worker to those who care for sick who tend child who do most difficult and tiring job the new direction propose will make this solemn simple commitment by expand the refundable earn income tax credit will make history will reward the work of million of work poor americans by realize the principle that if work 40|hour a week and have get a child in the house will no longer be in poverty later|this|year will offer a plan to end welfare as know have work on this issue for the well part of a|decade and know from personal conversation with many people that no one no one want to change the welfare system as badly as those who be trap in want to offer the people on welfare the education the training the child care the health care need to get back on foot but say after must get back to work too in private business if possible in public service if necessary have to end welfare as a way of life and make a path to independence and dignity next great goal should be to strengthen family compliment the congress for pass the family and medical leave act as a good first step but be time to do more this plan will give this country the tough child support enforcement system have ever have be time to demand that people take responsibility for the child bring in this world and ask to help to protect family against the violent crime which terrorize people and which tear community apart must pass a tough crime bill support not only the bill which do not quite make to the president 's desk last|year but also an initiative to put more police officer on the street to provide boot camp for first time nonviolent offender for more space for the hardened criminal in jail and support an initiative to do what can to keep gun out of the hand of criminal let say this will make this bargain if will pass the brady bill will sure sign let say now should move to the hard part think be clear to every american include every member of congress of both party that the confidence of the people who pay bill in institution in washington be not high must restore must begin again to make government work for ordinary taxpayer not simply for organized interest group and that beginning must start with real political reform be ask the|united|states|congress to pass a real campaign finance reform bill this|year ask to increase the participation of the american people by pass the motor voter bill promptly ask to deal with the undue influence of special interest by pass a bill to end the tax deduction for lobby and to act quickly to require all the people who lobby to register as lobbyist by pass the lobby registration bill believe be cheer that last section at home believe lobby reform and campaign finance reform be a sure path to increase popularity for republicans and democrats alike because say to the voter back home this be house this be senate be hire hand and every penny draw be money next to revolutionize government have to ensure that live within mean and that should start at the top and with the|white|house in the|last|few|day have announce a cut in the white|house staff of save approximately|$10|million have order administrative cut in budget of agency and department have cut the federal bureaucracy or will over the|next|4|years by approximately|100,000 position for a combine saving of be time for government to demonstrate in the condition be in that can be as frugal as any household in america and that be why also want to congratulate the congress notice the announcement of the leadership today that congress be take similar step to cut cost think that be important think will send a very clear signal to the american people but if really want to cut spending be go to have to do more and some of will be difficult tonight call for an across the board freeze in federal|government salary for one|year and thereafter during this period recommend that salary rise at point low than the cost of live allowance normally involve in federal pay increase next recommend that make specific budget cut as know and that all those who say should cut more be as specific as have be finally let say to friend on both side of the aisle be not enough simply to cut government have to rethink the whole way work when become president be amazed at just the way the|white|house work in way that add lot of money to what taxpayer have to pay outmoded way that do not take maximum advantage of technology and do not do thing that any business would have do years|ago to save taxpayer ' money so want to bring a new spirit of innovation into every government|department want to push education reform as say not just to spend more money but to really improve learning some thing work and some thing do not ought to be subsidize the thing that work and discourage the thing that do not would like to use that superfund to clean up pollution for a change and not just pay lawyer in the aftermath of all the difficulty with the saving and loan must use federal bank regulator to protect the security and safety of financial institution but should not be use to continue the credit crunch and to stop people from make sensible loan would like for to not only have welfare reform but to reexamine the whole focus of all of program that help people to shift from entitlement program to empowerment program in the end want people not to need anymore think that be important but in the end have to get back to the deficit for year there be be a lot of talk about but very few credible effort to deal with and now understand why have deal with the real number for but believe this plan do tackle the budget deficit seriously and over the long term put in place of the big deficit reduction and of the big change in federal priority from consumption to investment in the history of this country at the same time over the|next|4|years let say to all the people watch tonight who will ask these question begin tomorrow as go around the country and who have ask in the past be not cut the deficit just because expert say be the thing to do or because have some intrinsic merit have to cut the deficit because the more spend pay off the debt the less tax dollar have to invest in job and education and the future of this country and the more money take out of the pool of available saving the hard be for people in the private sector to borrow money at affordable interest rate for a college loan for child for a home mortgage or to start a new business that be why have get to reduce the debt because be crowd out other activity that ought to be engage in and that the american people ought to be engage in cut the deficit so that child will be able to buy a home so that company can invest in the future and in retrain worker so that government can make the kind of investment need to be a strong and smart and safe nation if do not act now and may not even recognize this government if just stay with the same trend of the|last|4|years by the|end|of|the|decade the deficit will be a year almost|80|percent of gross domestic product and pay interest on that debt will be the costly government program of all will still be the world 's large debtor and when member of congress come here will be devote over 20|cent on the dollar to interest payment more|than|half of the budget to health care and to other entitlement and will come here and deliberate and argue over or on the dollar no matter what america 's problem be will not be able to have the independence need to chart the future that must and will be terribly dependent on foreign fund for a large portion of investment this budget plan by contrast will by cut in that|year alone from the deficit a real spending cut a real revenue increase a real deficit reduction use the independent number of the|congressional|budget|office laughter well can laugh fellow republicans but will point out that the|congressional|budget|office be normally more conservative in what be go to happen and closer to right than previous president have be do this so that could argue about priority with the same set of number do this so that no one could say be estimate way out of this difficulty do this because if can agree together on the most prudent revenue be likely to get if the recovery stay and do right thing economically then will turn out better for the american people than say in the|last|12|year because there be difference over the revenue estimate and know that both party be give great elbow room for irresponsibility this be tighten the rein on the democrats as well as the republicans let at least argue about the same set of number so the american people will think be shoot straight with as say earlier recommendation make more|than|150 difficult reduction to cut the federal spending by a total of be eliminate program that be no longer need such as nuclear power research and development be slash subsidy and cancel wasteful project but many of these program be justify in time and a lot of be difficult for to recommend reduction in some really tough one for personally recommend that reduce interest subsidy to the|rural|electric|administration that be a difficult thing for to recommend but think that can not exempt the thing that exist in state or in experience if ask to deal with thing that be difficult for to deal with be go to have to have no sacred cow except the fundamental abide interest of the american people have to say that all know government have be just great at build program the time have come to show the american people that can limit too that can not only start thing that can actually stop thing about the defense budget raise a hope and a caution as restructure military force to meet the new threat of the post - cold war world be true that can responsibly reduce defense budget and may all doubt what that range of reduction be but let say that as long as be president will do everything can to make sure that the man and woman who serve under the american flag will remain the best train the best prepare the best equipped fighting force in the world and every of should make that solemn pledge still have responsibility around the world be the world 's only superpower this be still a dangerous and uncertain time and owe to the people in uniform to make sure that adequately provide for the national defense and for interest and need back by an effective national defense and a strong economy nation will be prepared to lead a world challenge as be everywhere by ethnic conflict by the proliferation of weapon of mass destruction by the global democratic revolution and by challenge to the health of global environment know this economic plan be ambitious but honestly believe be necessary for the continued greatness of the|united|state and think be pay for fairly first by cut government then by ask the most of those who benefit the most in the past and by ask more americans to contribute today so that all of can prosper tomorrow for the wealthy those earn per year ask all who be listen tonight to support a raise in the top rate for federal income taxis from to recommend a surtax on income a year and recommend close some loophole that let some people get away without pay any tax at all for business with taxable income in excess of recommend a raise in the corporate tax rate also to as well as a cut in the deduction for business entertainment expense plan seek to attack tax subsidy that actually reward company more for shut operation down here and move overseas than for stay here and reinveste in america say that as someone who believe that american company should be free to invest around the world and as a former governor who actively seek investment of foreign company in state but the|tax|code should not express a preference to american company for move somewhere else and do in particular case today will seek to ensure that through effective tax enforcement foreign corporation who do make money in america simply pay the same taxis that american company make on the same income to middle class americans who have pay a great deal for the|last|12|year and from whom ask a contribution tonight will say again as do on monday|night be not go alone any more be certainly not go first and be not go to pay more for less as have too often in the past want to emphasize the fact about this plan of america 's family will have no increase in income tax rate only|1.2|percent at the top let be clear there will also be no new cut in benefit for medicare as move toward the|4th|year with the explosion in health care cost as say project to account for of the growth of the deficit between|now|and|the|year|2000 there must be plan cut in payment to provider to doctor to hospital to lab as a way of control health care cost but see these only as a stopgap until can reform the entire health care system if will help do that can be fair to the provider and to the consumer of health care let repeat this because know matter to a lot of on both side of the aisle this plan do not make a recommendation for new cut in medicare benefit for any beneficiary secondly the only change be make in social|security be that have already be publicize the plan do ask old americans with high income who do not rely solely on social|security to get by to contribute more this plan will not affect the|80|percent of social|security recipient who do not pay taxis on social|security now those who do not pay tax on social|security now will not be affect by this plan plan do include a broad base tax on energy and want to tell why select this and why think be a good idea recommend that adopt a btu tax on the heat content of energy as the good way to provide with revenue to lower the deficit because also combat pollution promote energy efficiency promote the independence economically of this country as well as help to reduce the debt and because do not discriminate against any area unlike a carbon tax that be not too hard on the coal states unlike a gas tax that be not too tough on people who drive a long way to work unlike an ad valorem tax do not increase just when the price of an energy source go up and be environmentally responsible will help in the future as well as in the present with the deficit take together these measure will cost an american family with an income of about|$40,000 a year less|than|$17 a month will cost american family with income under nothing because of other program propose principally those raise the earn income tax credit because of publicly state determination to reduce the deficit if do these thing will see the continuation of what be happen just since the election just since the election since the secretary of the treasury the director of the|office|of|management|and|budget and other who have begin to speak out publicly in favor of a tough deficit reduction plan interest rate have continue to fall long term that mean that for the middle class who will pay something more each|month if have any credit need or demand increase energy cost will be more than offset by low interest cost for mortgage consumer loan credit card this can be a wise investment for and country now would also point out what the american people already know and that is because be a big vast country where drive long distance have maintain far low burden on energy than any other advanced country will still have far low burden on energy than any other advanced country and these will be spread fairly with real attempt to make sure that no cost be impose on family with income under and that the cost be very modest until get into the high income group where the income tax trigger in now ask all of to consider this whatever think of the tax program whatever think of the spending cut consider the cost of not change remember the number that all know if just keep on do what be do by the|end|of|the|decade will have a a year deficit if just keep on do what be do by the|end|of|the|decade of national income will go to health care every|year twice as much as any other country on the face of the globe if just keep on do what be do over 20|cent on the dollar will have to go to service the debt unless have the courage now to start build future and stop borrow from be condemn to year of stagnation interrupt by occasional recession to slow growth in job to no more growth in income to more debt to more disappointment bad unless change unless increase investment and reduce the debt to raise productivity so that can generate both job and income will be condemn child and child 's child to a less life than enjoy once americans look forward to double living standard every|25|year at present productivity rate will take to double living standard until grandchild 's grandchild be bear say that be too long to wait tonight the american people know have to change but be also likely to ask tomorrow and all of for the|week and month ahead whether have the fortitude to make the change happen in the right way know that as soon as leave this chamber and go home various interest group will be out in force lobby against this or that piece of this plan and that the force of conventional wisdom will offer a reason why well ought to do this but just can not do people will be watch and wonder not to see whether disagree with on a particular issue but just to see whether this be go to be business as usual or a real new day whether be all go to conduct as if know be work for must scale the wall of the people 's scepticism not with word but with deed after so|many|year of gridlock and indecision after so many hopeful beginning and so few promising result the american people be go to be harsh in judgment of all of if fail to seize this moment this economic plan can not please everybody if the package be pick apart there will be something that will anger each of will not please anybody but if be take as a whole will help all of so ask all to begin by resist the temptation to focus only on a particular spending cut do not like or some particular investment that be not make and nobody like the tax increase but let just face fact for through administration of both party income have stall and debt have explode and productivity have not grow as should can not deny the reality of condition have get to play the hand be deal and play as best can fellow americans the test of this plan can not be what be in for have get to be what be in for if work hard and if work together if rededicate to create job to rewarding work to strengthen family to reinvent government can lift country 's fortune again tonight ask everyone in this chamber and every american to look simply into heart to spark own hope to fire own imagination there be so much good so much possibility so much excitement in this country now that if act boldly and honestly as leader should legacy will be of prosperity and progress this must be america 's new direction let summon the courage to seize thank god bless america view transcript transcript thank very much thank mrs. yandle never have a well introduction

kennedy and senator dodd for passionate and year long commitment to this effort want to thank the speaker speaker foley and congressman ford the chairman of the committee that have jurisdiction over

guarantee the right of up|to|12|weeks of unpaid leave per year when be urgently need at home to care for a newborn child or an ill family member this bill will strengthen family and believe will

inspire by this great victory today to have other when congress return to this city and go on about the people 's business thank very much view transcript transcript the president good afternoon lady and gentleman be sorry have a last minute delay occasion by another issue not this one the debate over whether to lift the ban on homosexual in the military have to put mildly spark a great deal of interest over the|last|few|day today as know have reach an agreement at least with senator nunn and senator mitchell about how will proceed in the|next|few|day but first would like to explain what believe about this issue and why and what have decide to do after a long conversation and a very good one with the|joint|chiefs|of|staff and discussion with several member of congress the issue be not whether there should be homosexual in the military everyone concede that there be the issue be whether man and woman who can and have serve with real distinction should be exclude from military service solely on the basis of status and believe should not the principle on which base this position be this believe that american citizen who want to serve country should be able to do so unless conduct disqualify from do so military life be fundamentally different from civilian society necessarily have a different and strict code of conduct even a different code of justice nonetheless individual who be prepared to accept all necessary restriction on behavior many of which would be intolerable in civilian society should be able to serve country honorably and well have ask the secretary of defense to submit by july|the|15th a draft executive order after full consultation with military and congressional leader and concerned individual outside of the government which would end the present policy of the exclusion from military service solely on the basis of sexual orientation and at the same time establish rigorous standard regard sexual conduct to be apply to all military personnel this draft order will be accompany by a study conduct during the|next|6|months on the real practical problem that would be involve in this revision of policy so that will have a practical realistic approach consistent with the high standard of combat effectiveness and unit cohesion that armed service must maintain agree with the|joint|chief that the high standard of conduct must be require the change can not and should not be accomplish overnight do require extensive consultation with the|joint|chief expert in the congress and in the legal community join by administration and other have consult closely to date and will do so in the future during that process interim measure will be place into effect which hope again sharpen the focus of this debate the|joint|chiefs|of|staff have agree to remove the question regard one 's sexual orientation from future version of the enlistment application and will not be ask in the interim also all agree that a very high standard of conduct can and must be apply so the single area of disagreement be this should someone be able to serve country in uniform if say be homosexual but do nothing which violate the code of conduct or undermine unit cohesion or morale apart from that statement that be what all the furor of the|last|few|day have be about and the practical and not insignificant issue raise by that issue be what will be study in the|next|6|months through this period end july|15th the|department|of|justice will seek continuance in pende court case involve reinstatement and administrative separation under current department|of|defense policy base on status alone will be stay pende completion of this review the final discharge in case base only on status will be suspend until the president have an opportunity to review and act upon the final recommendation of the secretary of defense with respect to the current policy in the meantime a member whose discharge have be suspend by the attorney general will be separate from active duty and place in standby reserve until the final report of the secretary of defense and the final action of the president this be the agreement that have reach with senator nunn and senator mitchell during this review process will work with the congress and believe the compromise announce today by the senators and by show that can work together to end the gridlock that have plague city for too long this compromise be not everything would have hope for or everything that have stand for but be plainly a substantial step in the right direction and will allow to move forward on other terribly important issue affect far more americans administration come to this city with a mission to bring critical issue of reform and renewal and economic revitalization to the public debate issue that be central to the life of all americans be work on an economic reform agenda that will begin with an address to the joint session of congress on

opportunity to go to college will be propose comprehensive welfare reform legislation and other important initiative applaud the work that have be do in the|last|2|or|3|day by senator nunn senator mitchell and other to enable to move forward on a principle that be important to without shut the government down and run the risk of not even address the family and medical leave issue which be so important to america 's family before congress go into recess be look forward to get on with this issue over the|next|6|months and with these other issue which be so central to the campaign and far more importantly be so important to the life of all the american people q. mr. president yesterday a federal court in california say that the military ban on homosexual be unconstitutional will direct the navy and the|justice|department not to appeal that decision and how do that rule strengthen hand in this case the president well make point think strengthen hand if will in way agree with the principle embody in the case have not read the opinion but as understand the opinion draw the distinction that seek to draw between conduct and status and secondly make the practical point have be make all along which be that there be not insignificant chance that this matter would ultimately be resolve in the court in a way that would open admission into the military without the opportunity to deal with this whole range of practical issue which everyone who have ever think about or talk through concede be there so think can — strengthen hand on the principle as well as on the process q. mr. president there be a glass of water there by the way while ask the question do think since promise during the campaign literature put out a very clear statement lift the ban on homosexual in the military immediately — do think do not think through these practical problem what have learn from this experience in deal with powerful member of the senate and the|joint|chief and how much of a problem be this for to accept a compromise which do not meet real goal the president well have not give up on real goal think this be a dramatic step forward normally in the history of civil right advancement president have not necessarily be in the forefront in the beginning so think the fact that actually have the|joint|chiefs|of|staff agree that be time to take this question off the enlistment form that there ought to be a serious examination of how this would be do even though have not agree that should be do that the senate if vote for the motion advocate by senators|nunn and mitchell will agree senator who do not agree that the policy should be change be agree that ought to have a chance to work through this for and persuade of that think be very very significant now would remind that any president 's executive order can be overturn by an act of congress the president can then veto the act of congress and try to have veto sustain if the act stand on own as a simple issue that could always be veto but always know that there be a chance that congress would disagree with position can only tell that still think be right feel comfortable about the way have do this and be go to maintain the commitment that have q. but do think that have not examine the practical problems— q.|sir just wonder do think in retrospect that obviously do not intend the first week i'm sorry want to— the president no have always plan to allow some period of time during which policy would be develop to deal with what think be the significant practical problem this in effect may reverse the process over what intend to do but there have to be a time in which these issue these practical issue be develop and policy be develop to deal with q.|obviously do not intend the|first|week of administration give promise to have the laser focus on the economy to be see around the country as military gay right week wonder if in retrospect think could have do thing differently to have avoid that happen the president do not know how could have do that the|joint|chief ask for a meeting about a number of issue in which this be only spend a lot of time talk about other thing this issue be not put forward in this context by be put forward by those in the united|states senate who seek to make an issue early on and do not know how could have stop from do that q. do not think that in make the promise and then in promise to follow through on early that may have give rise to this do sir the president well think be pretty clear to that be talk about some sort of process day and days|ago and the people who want debate now be not deter by that and probably a lot of will not be deter by the agreement announce today think that must have the perfect right to do this but the timing of this whole issue be clearly force by the people in the senate who be oppose to any change of the policy no matter what the fact be and think that be right to do but control the timing of this not q. question first of all just to make sure that be clear on this july|15th this happen period regardless of what come out at these hearing be that correct the ban will be issue or will be lift rather the president that be position position be that still embrace the principle and think should be do the position of those who be opposed to be that think that the problem will be so overwhelming everybody with good sense will change position do not expect to do that q. so definitely expect to do and the president do not expect to change position no q. what do think be go to happen in the military there have be all sort of dire prediction of violence of mass comingsout whatever what do think the impact of this be go to be practically the president for thing think if look at the|last|10|year of experience here accord to the report have this country spend in tax dollar to separate something under homosexual from the service and have deal with complaint at least of sexual abuse heterosexual abuse largely against woman far great volume but during this period have plainly have the best educate best train most cohesive military force in the history of the|united|state and everybody ask anybody and the|joint|chiefs will tell that agree that should stop ask the question this single thing that be divide people on this debate want to make very clear that this be a very narrow issue be whether a person in the absence of any other disqualifying conduct can simply say that or be homosexual and stay in the service do not expect that to spark this kind of problem and certainly think in the|next|6|months as people start to work through and talk through a lot of legitimate practical issue will be raise and deal with in a more rational environment that be less charge that be certainly what hope will happen thank view transcript transcript fellow citizen today celebrate the mystery of american renewal this ceremony be hold in the depth of winter

for that very kind introduction barbara and be just delighted to be here and honor that could be join by able secretary of the army mike|stone of course the man well know here that head army general sullivan general gordon|sullivan and gracie|graves general robert|foley general galloway well know to everybody here be host in a sense and a west|point alum who have be at side for over here somewhere general scowcroft graduate of this great institution who serve country with such distinction may salute the member of the|board|of|visitors see another have to single out general galvin who serve country with such honor and of course save the good for last thank for that welcome let begin with the hard part be difficult for a navy person to come up to west|point after that game a|month|ago go ahead rub in.&nbsp;but watch amazing thing can happen in sport look at the oilers other team that take on the chin the|other|day but guess the moral of all of this be that losing be never easy trust know something about that laughter but if have to lose that be the way to do fight with all have give good shot and win or lose learn from and get on with life be about to get on with the rest of life but before do want to share with at this institution of leadership some of thinking both about the world will soon be call upon to enter and the life that have choose any president have several function speak for and to the nation must faithfully execute the law and must lead but no function none of the president 's hat in view be more important than role as commander in chief for be as commander in chief that the president confront and make decision that way or another affect the life of everyone in this country as well as many other around the world have have many occasion to don this most important of hat over the|past|4|years the man and woman who proudly and bravely wear the uniform of the u.s. armed service have be call upon to go in harm 's way and have discharge duty with honor and professionalism wish could say that such demand be a thing of the past that with the end of the cold war the call upon the|united|state would diminish can not yes the end of the cold war would all concede be a blessing be a time of great promise democratic government have never be so numerous what happen 2|or|3|days|ago in moscow would not have be possible in the|cold|war day thank to historic treaty such as that start ii pact just reach with russia the likelihood of nuclear holocaust be vastly diminish but this do not mean that there be no specter of war no threat to be reckon with and already see disturb sign of what this new world could become if be passive and aloof would risk the emergence of a world characterize by violence characterize by chaos in which dictator and tyrant threaten neighbor build arsenal brim with weapon of mass destruction and ignore the welfare of own man woman and child and could see a horrible increase in international terrorism with american citizen more at risk than ever before can not and need not allow this to happen objective must be to exploit the unparalleled opportunity present by the cold war 's end to work toward transform this new world into a new world order of government that be democratic tolerant and economically free at home and commit abroad to settle inevitable difference peacefully without the threat or use of force unfortunately not everyone subscribe to these principle continue to see leader bent on deny fundamental human right and seize territory regardless of the human cost no an international society more attuned to the endure principle that have make this country a beacon of hope for so many for so long will not just emerge on own be get to be build two|hundred|years|ago another depart president warn of the danger of what describe as entangle alliance be the right course for a new nation at that point in history but what be entangle in washington 's day be now essential this be why at texas a&amp;m a|few|weeks|ago speak of the folly of isolationism and of the importance morally economically and strategically of the|united|state remain involve in world affair must engage if a new world order more compatible with value and congenial to interest be to emerge but even more must lead leadership well take many form can be political or diplomatic can be economic or military can be moral or spiritual leadership leadership can take any of these form or can be a combination of leadership should not be confuse with either unilateralism or universalism need not respond by to each and every outrage of violence the fact that america can act do not mean that must a nation 's sense of idealism nee not be at odd with interest nor do principle displace prudence no the|united|states should not seek to be the world 's policeman there be no support abroad or at home for to play this role nor should there be would exhaust in the process waste precious resource need to address those problem at home and abroad that can not afford to ignore but in the wake of the cold war in a world where be the only remain superpower be the role of the|united|state to marshal moral and material resource to promote a democratic peace be responsibility be opportunity to lead there be no one else leadership can not be simply assert or demand must be demonstrate leadership require formulate worthy goal persuade other of virtue and contribute one 's share of the common effort and then some leadership take time take patience take work some of this work must take place here at home congress do have a constitutional role to play leadership therefore also involve work with the congress and the american people to provide the essential domestic underpinning if u.s. military commitment be to be sustainable this be what administration the bush administration have try to do when invade kuwait be the|united|state that galvanize the|u.n.|security|council to act and then mobilize the successful coalition on the battlefield the pattern not exactly the same but similar in somalia first the|united|state underscore the importance of alleviate the grow tragedy and then organize humanitarian effort design to bring hope food and peace at time real leadership require a willingness to use military force and force can be a useful backdrop to diplomacy a complement to or if nee be a temporary alternative as commander in chief have make the difficult choice to use military force determine could not allow saddam 's force to ravage kuwait and hold this critical region at gunpoint think then and think now that use military force to implement the resolution of the|u.n.|security|council be in the interest of the|united|state and the world community the need to use force arise as well in the wake of the|gulf|war when come to the aid of the people of both northern and southern iraq and more recently as be sure know determine that only the use of force could stem this human tragedy of somalia the|united|state should not stand by with so many life at stake and when a limited deployment of u.s. force buttress by the force of other country and act under the full authority of the|united|nation could make an immediate and dramatic difference and do so without excessive level of risk and cost operations|provide|comfort|and|southern|watch in iraq and then in somalia all bear witness to the wisdom of select use of force for selective purpose sometimes the decision not to use force to stay hand can tell be just as difficult as the decision to send soldier into battle the former yugoslavia well be be such a situation there be all know important humanitarian and strategic interest at stake there but up to now be not be clear that the application of limited amount of force by the|united|state and traditional friend and ally would have have the desire effect give the nature and complexity of that situation assessment of the situation in the former yugoslavia could well change if and as the situation change the stake could grow the conflict could threaten to spread indeed be constantly reassess option and be actively consult with other about step that may be take to contain the fighting protect the humanitarian effort and deny serbia the fruit of aggression military force be never a tool to be use lightly or universally in some circumstance may be essential in other counterproductive know that many people would like to find some formula some easy formula to apply to tell with precision when and where to intervene with force anyone look for scientific certitude be in for a disappointment in the complex new world be enter there can be no single or simple set of fix rule for use force inevitably the question of military intervention require judgment each and every case be unique to adopt rigid criterion would guarantee mistake involve american interest and american life and would give would be troublemaker a blueprint for determine own action could signal u.s. friend and ally that support be not to be count on similarly can not always decide in advance which interest will require use military force to protect the relative importance of an interest be not a guide military force may not be the good way of safeguard something vital while use force may be the good way to protect an interest that qualify as important but less than vital but to warn against a futile quest for a set of hard and fast rule to govern the use of military force be not to say there can not be some principle to inform decision such guideline can prove useful in sizing and indeed shape force and in help to think way through this key question use military force make sense as a policy where the stake warrant where and when force can be effective where no other policy be likely to prove effective where application can be limit in scope and time and where the potential benefit justify the potential cost and sacrifice once be satisfied that force make sense must act with the maximum possible support the|united|state can and should lead but will want to act in concert where possible involve the|united|nation or other multinational grouping the|united|state can and should contribute to the common undertaking in a manner commensurate with wealth with strength but other should also contribute militarily be by provide combat or support force access to facility or basis or overflight right and similarly other should contribute economically be unreasonable to expect the|united|state to bear the full financial burden of intervention when other nation have a stake in the outcome a desire for international support must not become a prerequisite for acting though sometimes a great power have to act alone make a tough decision may say on advice of outstanding military leader who be so well known to everybody here — to use military force in panama when american life and the security of the canal appear to be threaten by outlaw who steal power in the face of free election and similarly move swiftly to safeguard democracy in the philippines but in every case involve the use of force will be essential to have a clear and achievable mission a realistic plan for accomplish the mission and criteria no less realistic for withdraw u.s. force once the mission be complete only if keep these principle in mind will the potential sacrifice be that can be explain and justify must never forget that use force be not some political abstraction but a real commitment of father and mother and son and daughter brother and sister friend and neighbor have get to look at in human term in order even to have the choice must have available adequate military force tailor for a wide range of contingency include peacekeeping indeed lead the effort toward a new world order will require a modern capable military in some area necessitate more rather than less defense spending as president have say that ability to deploy force on behalf of u.s. interest abroad be make possible because past president and would single out in particular predecessor ronald|reagan and past secretaries|of|defense sustain a strong military consistent with this sacred trust be proud to pass on to successor president elect clinton a military second to none have the very good yet be essential to recognize that as important as such factor be any military be more than simply the sum of weapon or the state of technology what make any armed force truly effective be the quality of leadership the quality of training the quality of people have succeed abroad in no small part because of people in uniform the man and woman in armed|force have demonstrate ability to master the challenge of modern warfare and at the same time and whether on the battlefield of iraq or in some tiny little village in somalia america 's soldier have always bring a quality of caring and kindness to mission who will ever forget — know won't those terrify iraqi soldier surrender to american troop and who will forget the way the american soldier hold out arm and say be okay be all right now or in somalia the young marine eye fill with tear hold the fragile arm of an emaciate child there can be no doubt about the|all|volunteer|force be of the true success story of modern day america be instructive to look at just why this be so at heart a voluntary military be base upon choice all know that the decision freely take by young man and woman to join the decision by more mature man and woman to remain and the institution of the|armed|force have thrive on commitment to develop and promote excellence be meritocracy in action race religion wealth background count not indeed the military offer many example for the rest of society show what can be do to eradicate the scourge of drug to break down the barrier of racial discrimination to offer equal opportunity to woman this be not just a result of self selection also reflect the military 's commitment to education and training know people speak of defense conversion the process by which the defense firm retool for civilian task well defense conversion within the military have be go on for year be the constant process of training and retraining which the military do so well that allow individual to keep up with the late technology take on more challenging assignment and prepare for life on the outside out of this culture of merit and competition have emerge hundreds|of|thousand of highly skilled man and woman brim with real self confidence what possess be a special mix of discipline a willingness to accept direction and the confidence a willingness to accept responsibility together discipline and confidence provide the basis for win for get the job do there be no high calling no more honorable choice than the one that here today have make to join the|armed|force be to be prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice for country and for fellow man what have do what be do send an important message that fear sometimes get lose amidst today 's often materialist self interested culture be important to remember be important to demonstrate that there be a high purpose to life beyond one 's self now speak of family of community of ideal speak of duty honor country there be many form of contribute to this country of public service yes there be government there be voluntarism love to talk about the points of light american help another the daily task that require do in classroom in hospital city

to deny people the truth about and about in the end soviet communism be destroy by own internal contradiction new leader with new vision face the hard truth that predecessor have long deny may have be russian word but the concept at core be universal the|soviet|union do not simply lose the cold war the western democracy win say this not to gloat but to make a key point the quality that enable to triumph in that struggle faith strength unity and above all american leadership be those must call upon now to win the peace in recent|years with the soviet empire in death throe the potential for crisis and conflict be never great the demand for american leadership never more compelling as the people of make bold move for freedom urge along a peaceful path to liberation turn to turn to america and do not turn away and when german friend take hammer to tear down that wall encourage a united germany safely within the nato alliance look to america and do not look away and when the people of russia block the tank that try to roll back the tide of history america do not walk away can remember speak to boris|yeltsin at that terrible moment of crisis at time the static on the telephone make almost impossible to hear but there be no mistake what want to know ask where the|united|states|of|america stand and america answer for all the world to hear stand with boris|yeltsin to this|day have not forget praise country on visit to the|white|house say george|bush be the first to understand the true scope and meaning of the victory of the russian people on august|19,|1991 address but be talk about country the free people of the world watch watch in awe as the|soviet|union collapse but hold breath at what may take place wonder who may control tens|of|thousand of nuclear weapon only america could manage that danger act decisively to help the new leader reduce arsenal and gain firm control of those that remain here then be the remarkable fact that history will record a fact that will be

global spread of free market by encourage trade investment and growth will sustain the expansion of american prosperity in short by help other help some will dismiss this vision as no more than a dream ask to consider the|last|4|years when a|dozen dream be make real the berlin wall demolish and germany unite the captive nation set free russia democratic whole class of nuclear weapon eliminate the rest vastly reduce many nation unite in historic u.n. coalition to turn back a tyrant in the|persian|gulf israel and arab neighbor for the first time talk peace face to face in a region that have know so much war each of these once seem a dream today be concrete reality bring about by a common cause the patient and judicious application of american leadership american power and perhaps most of all american moral force without a doubt there be go to be serious obstacle and setback ahead know and know that face some already violence poverty ethnic and religious hatred will be powerful adversary and overcome be go to take time and be go to take tenacity courage and commitment but be absolutely convinced that can be overcome look to europe where nation after century of war transform into a peaceful progressive community no society no continent should be disqualify from share the ideal of human liberty the community of democratic nation be more robust then ever and will gain strength as grow by work with ally by invigorate international institution america do not have to stand alone yet from some|quarters hear voice sound the retreat have carry the burden too long say and the disappearance of the soviet challenge mean that america can withdraw from international responsibility and then other assert that domestic need preclude an active foreign policy that have do part now be someone else 's turn be warn against entangle in the trouble that abound in today 's world to name only a few clan warfare mass starvation in somalia savage violence in bosnia instability in the former soviet|union the alarming growth of virulent nationalism be true these problem some freeze by the cold war other hold in check by communist repression seem to have ignite all at once tax the world 's ability to respond but let be clear the alternative to american leadership be not more security for citizen but less not the flourishing of american principle but isolation in a world actively hold hostile to destiny have be say be not a matter of chance be a matter of choice be not a thing to be wait for be a thing to be achieve and can never safely assume that future will be an improvement over the past choice as a people be simple can either shape time or can let the time shape and shape will at a price frightening to contemplate morally economically and strategically morally a failure to respond to massive human catastrophe like that in somalia would scar the soul of nation there can be no single or simple set of guideline for foreign policy should help but should consider use military force only in those situation where the stake warrant where can be effective and application limit in scope and time as seek to save life must always be mindful of the life that may have to put at risk economically a world of escalate instability and hostile nationalism will disrupt global market set off trade war set on a path of economic decline american job would be lose chance to compete would be block and very well being would be undermine strategically abandonment of the worldwide democratic revolution could be disastrous for american security the alternative to democracy think would all agree be authoritarianism regime that can be repressive xenophobic aggressive and violent and in a world where despite u.s. effort weapon of mass destruction be spread the collapse of the democratic revolution could pose a direct threat to the safety of every single american the new world could in time be as menacing as the old and let be blunt a retreat from american leadership from american involvement would be a mistake for which future generation indeed own child would pay dearly but can influence the future can rededicate to the hard work of freedom and this do not mean run off on reckless expensive crusade do not mean bear the world 's burden all alone but do mean leadership economic political and yes military when interest and value be at risk and where

create need a new approach the same old experience be not relevant be live in a new world after the cold war and what work in this new world be not trickle down not government for the benefit of the privileged few not tax and spend but a commitment to invest in american job and american education control american health care cost and bring the american people together that be what work and can have the right kind of experience and the wrong kind of experience be root in the real life of real people and will bring real result if have the courage to change mr. lehrer president bush one|minute to respond president bush just think of another another big difference here between do not believe mr. perot feel this way but know governor clinton do because want to accurately quote think think say that the country be come apart at the seam now know that the only way can win be to make everybody believe the economy be bad than be but this country be not come apart at the seam for heaven sake be the|united|states|of|america in spite of the economic problem be the most respected economy around the world many would trade for have be catch up in a global slowdown can do much much well but ought not to try to convince the american people that america be a country that be come apart at the seam would hate to be run for president and think that the only way could win would be to convince everybody how horrible thing be yes there be big problem and yes people be hurt but believe that this agenda for american|renewal have be the answer to do and believe can get do now whereas do not in the past because be go to have a whole brandnew bunch of people in the congress that be go to have to listen to the same american people be listen to mr. lehrer mr. perot a|minute response sir mr. perot well have get a point do not have any experience in run up a debt do not have any experience in gridlocke government where nobody take responsibility for anything and everybody blame everybody else do not have any experience in create the bad public school system in the industrialized world the most violent crime ride society in the industrialized world but do have a lot of experience in get thing do so if be at a point in history where want to stop talk about and do have get a lot of experience in figure out how to solve problem make the solution work and then move on to the next have get a lot of experience in not take 10|year to solve a 10-minute problem so if be time for action think have experience that count if be more time for gridlock and talk and finger point be the wrong man character issue mr. lehrer president bush the question go to have and the question be this be there important issue of character separate from these other man president bush think the american people should be the judge of that think character be a very important question say something the|other|day where be accuse of be like joe|mccarthy because question put this way think be wrong to demonstrate against own country or organize demonstration against own country in foreign soil just think be wrong maybe say well be a youthful indiscretion be or fly off an aircraft carrier and that shape to be commander in chief of the|armed|force and be sorry but demonstrate be not a question of patriotism be a question of character and judgment get on bill be get on about read lip when make a mistake will admit but have not admit the mistake and just find impossible to understand how an american can demonstrate against own country in a foreign land organize demonstration against when young man be hold prisoner in hanoi or kid out of the ghetto be draft some say well be a little old fashioned maybe be but just do not think that be right now whether be character or judgment whatever be have a big difference here on this issue and so will just have to see how play out but could not do that and do not think most americans could do that and all say well be a long time ago well let admit then say make a terrible mistake how could be commander in chief of the|armed|force and have some kid say when have to make a tough decision as do in panama or in kuwait and then have some kid jump up and say well be not go to go the commander in chief be organize demonstration halfway around the world during another era so there be difference but that be about the main area where think have a difference do not know about will talk about that a little with ross here in a bit mr. lehrer mr. perot have one|minute mr. perot think the american people will make own decision on character and at a time when have work to do and need action think need to clearly understand the background of each person think the press can play a huge role in make sure that the background be clearly present in an objective way then make a decision certainly anyone in the|white|house should have the character to be there but think be very important to measure when and where thing occur do occur when be a young person in formative year or do occur while be a senior official in the|federal|government when be a senior official in the|federal|government spend billions|of|dollars in taxpayer ' money and be a mature individual and make a mistake then that be on ticket if make as a young man time pass so would say just look at all of decide who think will do the job pick that person in november because believe as have say before the party be over and be time for the cleanup crew and do have to have change and people who never take responsibility for anything when happen on watch and people who be in charge mr. lehrer time be up mr. perot the time be up mr. lehrer time be up mr. perot more later mr. lehrer governor clinton have one|minute governor clinton ross give a good answer but have get to respond directly to mr. bush have question patriotism even bring some right wing congressman into the|white|house to plot how to attack for go to russia in when over|50,000 other americans do now honor service in world|war|ii honor mr. perot 's service in uniform and the service of every man and woman who ever serve include admiral crowe who be chairman of the|joint|chief and who be support but when joe|mccarthy go around this country attack people 's patriotism be wrong be wrong and a senator from connecticut stand up to name prescott|bush father be right to stand up to joe|mccarthy be wrong to attack patriotism be oppose to the war but love country and need a president who will bring this country together not divide have have enough division want to lead a unified country mr. lehrer all right move now to the subject of taxis and spending the question go to governor clinton for a minute answer will be ask by ann|compton taxis ann|compton governor clinton can lock in a level here tonight on where middle income family can be guarantee a tax cut or at the very least at what income level can be guarantee no tax increase governor clinton the tax increase have propose trigger in at family income of and above those be the people who in the 's have income go up while taxis go down middle class people define as people with income of and down have income go down while taxis go up in the reagan bush year because of increase in the payroll taxis so that be where income limit would trigger ms. compton so there will be no tax increase below governor clinton plan notwithstanding opponent 's ad plan trigger in at gross income family income of and above and then want to give modest middle class tax relief to restore some fairness especially to middle class people with family with income of under in addition to that the money that raise from upper income people and from ask foreign corporation just to pay the same income on income earn in america that american corporation do will be use to give incentive back to upper income people want to give people permanent incentive on investment tax credit like president kennedy and the congress inaugurate in the|early|sixties to get industry move again a research and development tax credit a low income housing tax credit a long term capital gain proposal for new business and business expansion have get to have no more trickle down do not need across the board tax cut for the wealthy for nothing need to say here be tax incentive if create american job the old fashioned way would like to create more millionaire than be create under mr. bush and mr. reagan but do not want to have 4|year where have no growth in the private sector and that be what be happen in the|last|4|years be down job in the private sector need to invest and grow and that be what want to do mr. lehrer president bush one|minute sir president bush have to correct thing do not question the man 's patriotism question judgment and character what do in moscow that be fine let explain do accept that what do not accept be demonstrate and organize demonstration in a foreign country when country 's at war be sorry can not accept that this one on taxis spell out the big difference between do not believe need to go back to the mondale proposal or the dukakis proposal of tax and spend governor clinton say but also say want to raise tax people over|$200,000 will not get and then when add in other spending proposal regrettably end up sock to the work man that old adage that use be go to soak the rich be go to soak the rich always end up be the poor cab driver or the work man that end up pay the bill and so just have a different approach believe the way to get the deficit down be to control the growth of mandatory spending program and not raise taxis on the american people have get a big difference there mr. lehrer mr. perot one|minute mr. perot have get to have a growing expand job base to give a growing expand tax base right now have a flat to deteriorate job base and where appear to be grow be minimum wage job so have get to really rebuild job base that be go to take money for infrastructure and investment to do that foreign competitor be do be not can not pay off the debt balance the budget and have the industry of the future and the high pay job in this country without have the revenue be go to go through a period of share sacrifice there be challenge be get to be fair have create a mess and do not have much to show for and have get to fix and that be about all can say in a|minute mr. lehrer okay next question go to president bush for a answer and will be ask by sandy|vanocur u.s. troops in europe sander vanocur mr. president this|past|week secretary of the army michael|stone say have no plan to abide by a congressional mandate to cut u.s. force in europe from by the|end|of|september|1996 now why almost|50|year after the end of world|war|ii and with the total collapse of the|soviet|union should american taxpayer be tax support army in europe when the europeans have plenty of money to do for president bush well sander that be a good question and the answer be for keep the peace if look at the cost of not keep the peace in europe would be exorbitant have reduce the number of troop that be deploy and go to be deploy have cut defense spending and the reason could do that be because of fantastic success in win the cold war never would have get there if would go for the nuclear freeze crowd never would have get there if would listen to those that want to cut defense spending think be important that the|united|state stay in europe and continue to guarantee the peace simply can not pull back now when anybody have a spending program want to spend money on at home say well let cut money out of will accept and have accept the recommendation of prove leader general colin|powell and dick secretary dick|cheney feel that the level be operate at and the reduction that have propose be proper and so simply do not think should go back to the|isolation|days and start blame foreigner be the sole remaining superpower and should be that have a certain disproportionate responsibility but would ask the american people to understand that if make imprudent cut if go too far risk the peace and do not want to do that have see what be like to see the burden of a war and do not want to see make reckless cut because of program have be able to significantly cut defense spending but let not cut into the muscle and let not cut down insurance policy which be participation of american force in nato the great peacekeeping organization ever make today have get problem in europe still bubble along even though europe 's go democracy 's route but be there and think this insurance policy be necessary think go with world leadership and think the level have come up with be just about right mr. lehrer mr. perot one|minute sir mr. perot if be poor and be rich and can get to defend that be good but when the table get turn ought to do share right now spend about|$300|billion a year on defense the japanese spend around|$30|billion in asia the germans spend around|$30|billion in europe for example germany will spend building infrastructure over the|next|10|year be kind of easy to do if only have to pick up a tab to defend country the|european|community be in a position to pay a lot more than have in the past agree with the president when could not should have now that can should sort of seem to have a desire to try to stay over there and control do not want to control very candidly so think be very important for to let assume more and more of the burden and for to bring that money back here and rebuild infrastructure because can only be a superpower if be an economic superpower and can only be an economic superpower if have a growing expand job base mr. lehrer governor clinton one|minute sir governor clinton agree with the general statement mr. bush make disagree that need troop to fulfill role in europe certainly must maintain an engagement there there be certainly danger there there be certainly other trouble spot in the world which be close to europe than to the|united|state but former defense|secretarie recently issue report say that or slightly few troop would be enough include president reagan 's former defense secretary mr. carlucci many of the military expert whom consult on this agree be go to have to spend more money in the future on military technology and on great mobility great airlift great sealift the b-22 airplane be go to have to do some thing that be quite costly and simply do not believe can afford nor do need to keep troop in europe give how much the|red|army now under the control of russia have be cut the arm control agreement conclude between mr. bush and mr. yeltsin something have applaud do not think need troop let make other point mr. bush talk about taxis do not tell that veto a middle class tax cut because would be pay for by raise taxis on the wealthy and veto an investment tax credit pay for by raise taxis on the wealthy taxis mr. lehrer all right go now to mr. perot for a question and will be ask by john|mashek john|mashek mr. perot talk about fairness just|a|minute|ago on share the pain as part of plan to reduce the balloon federal deficit have suggest that raise gasoline taxis a gallon over|5|year why punish the middle class consumer to such a degree mr. perot be a year cumulative finally get to at the|end|of|the|fifth|year think punish be the wrong word again see do not create this problem be try to solve now if study international competitor some of international competitor collect up|to|$3.50 a gallon in taxis and use that money to build infrastructure and create job collect and do not have to spend know be not popular and understand the nature of question but the people who will be help the most by be the work people who will get the job create because of this tax why do have to do because have so mismanage country over the|year and be now time to pay the fiddler and if do not will be spend child 's money have spend worth an incredible number of young people be active in support effort because be deeply concerned that have take the american dream from think be fitting that be on the campus of a university tonight these young people when get out of this wonderful university will have difficulty find a job have get to clean this mess up leave this country in good shape and pass

a global slowdown right now but that will change if go with the program have talk about and if help with job retraining and education be a firm believer that america education problem be the answer a little long run be go to take a while to educate but be a good program so good hope for short term be job retrain if be throw out of work at a defense plant but tell be not all that gloomy be the|united|state have face tough problem before look at the misery index when the democrats have both the|white|house and the congress be just right through the roof now can do better and the way to do better be not to tax and spend but to retrain get that control of the mandatory spending program be much more optimistic about this country than some mr. lehrer mr. perot have one|minute sir mr. perot defense industry be go to have to convert to civilian industry many of be and the sooner start the sooner will finish and there will be a significant transition and be very important that not continue to let industrial base deteriorate have someone who be sure regret say in the president 's staff say do not care whether make potato chip or computer chip well anybody that think about care a great deal number make more make computer chip than do potato chip number out of computer chip that have in this country now come from japan have give away whole industry so as phase these industry over there be a lot of intellectual talent in these industry a lot of these people in industry can be convert to the industry of tomorrow and that be where the high pay job be need to have a very carefully think through phaseover see practice 19th century capitalism the rest of the world practice 21st century capitalism can not handle that in a|minute but hope can get back into later the rest of the world the country and the business would be work together to make this transition in an intelligent way mr. lehrer governor clinton have one|minute sir governor clinton must have a transition plan a plan to convert from a defense to a domestic economy no other nation would have cut defense as much as already have without that there be people unemployed in california alone because have cut defense without plan to retrain and to reinvest in the technology of the future here at home that be what want to do this administration may say have a plan but the truth be have not even release all the money the paltry sum of money that congress appropriate want to take every dollar by which reduce defense and reinvest in technology for the|21st|century in new transportation in communication and environmental cleanup technology let put the american people to work and let build the kind of high tech high wage high growth economy that the american people deserve mr. lehrer all right the next question go to mr. perot for a answer will be ask by ann ann jobs program ms. compton mr. perot talk a|minute|ago about rebuild the job base but be true what governor clinton just say that that mean that unemployment will increase that will slow the economy and how would specifically use the power of the presidency to get more people back into good job immediately mr. perot step the american people send up there the|day after election will get with the will not even wait until inauguration will ask the president to help and will ask staff to help and will start put together team to put together to take all the plan that exist and do something with please understand there be great plan lie all over washington nobody ever execute be like have a blueprint for a house never build do not have anywhere to sleep now challenge be to take these thing do something with step want to put america back to work clean up the small business problem have task force at work on that the second have get big company that be in trouble include the defense industry have another one on that have a third task force on new industry of the future to make sure nail those for country and do not wind up in europe and asia convert from capitalism see have an adversarial relationship between government and business international competitor that be clean plate have an intelligent relationship between government and business and a supportive relationship then have another task force on crime because next to job people be concerned about safety health care school on the debt and deficit and finally in that period before the inauguration put together the framework for the town hall and give the american people a christmas present show by christmas the first cut at these plan by the time congress come into session to go to work have those plan ready to go in front of congress then get off to a fly start in to execute these plan now there be people in this room and people on this stage who have be in meeting when would sit there and say be this one be go to talk about or do something about well obviously orientation be let go do now put together plan by christmas be ready to go when congress go nail these thing small business have get to have capital have get to have credit and many of need mentor or coach and can create more job there in a hurry than any other place mr. lehrer governor clinton one|minute governor clinton this country desperately need a job program and first priority would be to pass a job program to introduce on the|first|day be inaugurate would meet with the leader of the congress with all the newly elect member of the congress and as many other with whom could meet between the time of the election and the inauguration and would present a job program then would present a plan to control health care cost and phase in health care coverage for all americans until control health care cost be not go to control the deficit be the number culprit but first must have an aggressive job program live in a state where manufacturing job growth have far outpace the nation in the|last|few|year where have create more private sector job since mr. bush have be president than have be create in the entire rest of the country where mr. bush 's labor secretary say the job growth have be enormous have do in arkansas give a chance to create these kind of job in america can do know can mr. lehrer president bush one|minute president bush well have get a plan announce for what can do for small business have already put forward thing that will get this country work fast some of which have be echo here tonight investment tax allowance capital gain reduction more on research and development a tax credit for first time homebuyer what be go to do be say to jim|baker when this campaign be over all right let sit down now do in domestic affair what have do in foreign affair be the kind of economic coordinator of all the domestic side of the house and that include all the economic side all the training side and bring this program together be go to have a new congress and be go to say to have listen to the voter the way have nobody want gridlock anymore and so let get the program through and believe will work because as ross say have get the plan the plan be all over washington and have put together in something call the agenda for american|renewal and make sense be sensible create job get to the base of the kind of job need and so will just be ask for support to get that put into effect mr. lehrer the next question go to governor clinton for will be ask by sandy federal|reserve|board chairman mr. vanocur governor clinton when a president run for the first time get into the office and want to do something about the economy find in washington there be a person who have much more power over the economy than do the chairman of the|federal|reserve|board accountable to no one that be the case would go along with proposal make by treasury secretary james|brady and congressman lee|hamilton to make the federal|reserve|board chairman somehow more accountable to elect official governor clinton well let say that think that may ought to review the term and the way work but frankly do not think that be the problem today have low interest rate today at least have low interest rate that the fed can control long term interest rate be still pretty high because of deficit and because of economic performance and there be a terrible reaction internationally to mr. bush say be go to give 4|more|year of trickle down economic and other across the board tax cut and most of go to the wealthy with no real guarantee of investment but think the important thing be to use the power the president do have on the assumption that give the condition of this economy be go to keep interest rate down if have the discipline to increase investment and reduce the debt at the same time that be commitment think the american people be hungry for action think congress be hungry for someone who will work with instead of manipulate someone who will not veto a bill that have an investment credit middle class tax relief research and development tax credit as mr. bush have do give a chance to do that do not have to worry do not think in the near term about the|federal|reserve policy so far seem to be pretty sound mr. lehrer president bush have one|minute president bush do not think the fed ought to be put under there be separation there think that be fine alan|greenspan be respect have have some argument with about the speed in which may have lower rate but governor clinton talk about the reaction to the market there be a momentary fear that may win and the market go rrrfft down like that do not can judge on the stock market have be strong be be very strong since have be president and recognize have get great difficulty but be also much more optimistic than the pessimist have up here tonight in term of veto tax bill be darn right be go to protect the american taxpayer against the spend and tax congress and be go to keep on veto because do not think be tax too little think the government 's spending too much so governor clinton can label tax for the rich or anything want be go to protect the work man by continue to veto and to threaten veto until get this new congress when then be go to move forward on plan i`ve get to protect mr. lehrer mr. perot one|minute mr. perot keep the federal reserve independent but let live in a world of reality live in a global economy not a national economy these interest rate have now do not make any sense have a debt and only in america would finance of it|5|years|or|less so of debt be be very interest sensitive have a gap between what pay for treasury and what germany pay for 1- to treasury that gap be go to close because the arabs the japanese and folk in this country be go to start buy german treasury because can get more money every time interest rate go up that add to the deficit or to the debt whichever place want to put be sit on a tick bomb folk because have totally mismanage country and have well get back under control just think in own business if have all of long term problem finance short term would go broke in a hurry mr. lehrer be go to move to foreign affair the first question go to mr. perot for a answer and sandy will ask foreign affairs mr. vanocur mr. perot in the post - cold war environment what should be the override u.s. national interest and what can do and what can afford to do to defend that national interest mr. perot again if be not rich be not a superpower so have that would put as number have a and 1a be have get to have the money to be able to pay for defense and have get to manufacture here believe or not folk can not ship all overseas have get to make here and can not convert from potato chip to airplane in an emergency see willow|run could be convert from car to airplane in world|war|ii because be here have get to make thing here just can not ship overseas anymore hope talk more about that second thing on priority have get to help russia succeed in revolution and all of republic when think of russia remember be think of many country now have get to help that be penny on the dollar compare to renew the cold war third have get all kind of agreement on paper and some that be be execute on get rid of nuclear warhead russia and republic be out of control or at good in weak control right now be a very unstable situation have get every rich middle|eastern country over there try to buy nuclear weapon as well know and that will lead to another star migraine headache down the road really need to nail down the intercontinental ballistic missile the one that can hit from russia have focus on the tactical have make real progress there have get some agreement on the nuclear but do not have those thing put away yet the sooner the well so in term of priority have get to be financially strong number have get to take care of this missile situation and try to get the nuclear war behind and give that a very high priority and number need to help and support russia and the republic in every possible way to become democratic capitalistic society and not just sit back and let those country continue in turmoil because could go back bad than thing use to be and believe there be a lot of old boy in the kgb and the military that like better the way use to be thank mr. lehrer governor clinton one|minute governor clinton in order to keep america the strong nation in the world need some continuity and some change there be fundamental challenge first of all the world be still a dangerous and uncertain place need a new military and a new national security policy equal to the challenge of the post - cold war era a small permanent military force but one that be more mobile well train with high technology equipment need to continue the negotiation to reduce nuclear arsenal in the|soviet|union the former soviet|union and the|united|state need to stop this proliferation of weapon of mass destruction have to face that in this world economic security be a whole lot of national security dollar be at an all time low against some foreign currency be weak in the world must rebuild america 's strength at home finally ought to be promote the democratic impulse around the world democracy be partner do not go to war with each other be reliable friend in the future national security economic strength democracy mr. lehrer president bush one|minute president bush still be the envy of the world in term of

tyrant include those in beijing as president how would exert u.s. power to influence affair in china governor clinton think relation ship with china be important and do not think want to isolate china but think be a mistake for to do what this administration do when all those kid go out there carry in tiananmen|square and mr. bush send people in secret to toast the chinese leader and basically tell not to worry about reward by open negotiation with iran to transfer nuclear technology that be response to that sort of action now that voice in the congress and throughout the country have insist that do something about china look what have happen china have finally agree to stop send product make with prison labor not because coddle but because the administration be push into do something about recently the chinese have announce that be go to lower some barrier to product which ought to do since have a trade surplus with the|united|state under mr. bush the second big surplus of all

legitimacy of those kid that be carry if can stand up for economic interest ought to be able to pursue the democratic interest of the people in china and over the long run will be more reliable partner mr. lehrer president bush have one|minute president bush well the administration be the first major country to stand up against the abuse in tiananmen|square be the one that work out the prison labor deal be the one that have lower the barrier to product the carla|hill negotiation be the one that say let keep the mfn because see china move toward a free market economy to do what the congress and governor clinton be suggest would isolate and ruin hong|kong be make some progress not enough for be the first one to put sanction on still have on some thing but governor clinton 's philosophy be isolate say do not do but the policy be expound of put condition on mfn and kind of humiliating be not the way make the kind of progress be get have stand up with these people and understand what have to do to be strong in this situation be move not as fast as would like but isolate china and turn inward and then have make a tremendous mistake be not go to do have have to fight a lot of people that be say human right be the one that put the sanction on and stand for and can insult general scowcroft if want to do not go over to coddle go over to say mr. lehrer mr. president be over president bush must make the very change be make now mr. lehrer one|minute mr. perot mr. perot china 's a huge country break into many province have some very elderly leader that will not be around too much longer capitalism be grow and thrive across big portion of china asia will be large trading partner in the future will be a growing and a close relationship have a delicate tightwire walk that must go through at the present time to make sure that do not cozy up to tyrant to make sure that do not get the impression that can suppress people but time be friend there because leader will change in not too many|years bad case and country be make great progress last point on the missile do not want the american people to be confuse have write agreement and have some missile that have be destroy but have a huge number of intercontinental ballistic missile that be still in place in russia the fact that have an agreement be thing until be destroy some crazy person can either sell or use mr. lehrer all right the next question go to president bush for a answer and ann will ask bosnia and somalia ms. compton mr. president how can watch the killing in bosnia and the ethnic cleansing or the starvation and anarchy in somalia and not want to use america 's might if not america 's military to try to end that kind of suffering president bush ann both of be very complicated situation vow something because learn something from vietnam be not go to commit u.s. force until know what the mission be until the military tell that can be complete until know how can come out be help american airplane be help today on humanitarian relief for sarajevo be america that be in the lead in help with humanitarian relief for somalia but when go to put somebody else 's son or daughter into war think have get to be a little bit careful and have to be sure that there be a military plan that can do this have ancient ethnic rivalry that have crop up as yugoslavia be dissolve or get dissolve be not go to be solve by send in the 82d airborne and be not go to do that as commander in chief be go to stand by and use the moral persuasion of the|united|state to get satisfaction in term

sorry time be up have to go to mr. perot for a minute response mr. perot if learn anything in vietnam be first commit this nation before commit the troop to the battlefield can not send people all over the world to solve every problem that come up this be basically a problem that be a primary concern to certainly care about the people care about the child care about the tragedy but be inappropriate for just because there be a problem somewhere around the world to take the son and daughter of work people and make no mistake about all volunteer armed force be not make up of the son and daughter of the beautiful people be the work folk that send son and daughter to war with a few exception very unlike world|war|ii when fdr 's son fly mission everybody go be a different world now be very important that not just without think through just rush to every problem in the world and have people tear to piece mr. lehrer governor clinton one|minute governor clinton agree that can not commit ground force to become involved in the quagmire of bosnia or in the tribal war of somalia but think that be important to recognize that there be thing that can be do short of that and that do have interest there there be after all two|million refugee now because of the problem in what be yugoslavia the large number since world|war|ii and there may be hundreds|of|thousand of people who will starve or freeze to death in this|winter the|united|states should try to work with ally and stop urge the president to support this air cover and do and applaud that applaud the no fly zone and know that be go back to the|united|nation to try to get authority to enforce think should stiffen the embargo on the belgrade government think have to consider whether or not should lift the arm embargo now on the bosnians since be in no way in a fair fight with a heavily armed opponent bent on ethnic cleansing can not get involve in the quagmire but must do what can mr. lehrer all right move on now to division in country the first question go to governor clinton for two|minute and ann will ask family value ms. compton governor clinton can tell what definition of the word family be governor clinton a family involve at|least|one parent whether natural or adoptive or foster and child a good family be a place where love and discipline and good value be transmute from the elder to the child a place where people turn for refuge and where know be the most important people in the world america have a lot of family that be in trouble today there be be a lot of talk about family value in this campaign know a lot about that be bear to a widow mother who give family value and grandparent have see the family value of people in arkansas have see the family value of all these people in america who be out there kill work harder for less in a country that be have in and the first decline in industrial production ever think the president owe to family value to show that value america 's family whether be people on welfare be try to move from welfare to work the work poor whom think deserve a tax break to lift above poverty if have get a child in the house and working 40|hour a week work family who deserve a fair tax system and the opportunity for constant retraining deserve a strong economy think deserve a family and medical leave act other nation have be able to do mr. bush veto twice because say can not do something other country do even though there be a small business exemption so with all the talk about family value know about family value would not be here without the good expression of family value be that tonight be 17th wedding anniversary and would like to close question by just wish wife a happy anniversary and thank daughter for be here mr. lehrer president bush one|minute president bush well would say that meeting that make a profound impression on be when the mayor of the big city include the mayor of los|angeles a democrat come to see and unanimously say the decline in urban america stem from the decline in the american family so do think need to strengthen family when barbara hold an aids baby be show a certain compassion for family when read to child the same thing believe that discipline and respect for the law all of these thing should be teach to child not in school but family have to do that be appal at the high outrageous number of divorce be happen in family be happen in our but be get too much and just think that ought to do everything can to respect the american family can be a single parent family those mother need help way to do be to get these deadbeat father to pay obligation to these mother that will help strengthen the american family and there be a whole bunch of other thing that can not click off in this short period of time mr. lehrer mr. perot have one|minute mr. perot if have to solve all the problem that face this country and could be grant wish as start down the trail to rebuild the job base the school and so on and so forth would say a strong family unit in every home where every child be love nurture and encourage a little child before be learn to think well of or or poorly develop a positive or negative self image at a very early age learn how to learn if have child who be not surround with love and affection see look at grandchild and wonder if will ever learn to walk because be always in someone 's arm think gosh would not be wonderful if every child have that love and support but do not will not be a great country unless have a strong family unit in every home and think can use the|white|house as a bully pulpit to stress the importance of these little child particularly in young and formative year to mold these little precious piece of clay so that too can live rich full life when be grow mr. lehrer new question answer go to president bush sandy will ask legalization of drug mr. vanocur mr. president there be be a lot of talk about harry|truman in this campaign so much so that think tomorrow will wake up and see name as the next commissioner of baseball president bush could use mr. vanocur the thing that mr. truman do not have to deal with be drug americans be increasingly alarm about drug relate crime in city and suburb and administration be not the first to have grapple with this be at all of a mind that maybe ought to go to another level if not to what be advocate by william|f.|buckley jr. and milton|friedman legalization somewhere between there and where be now president bush no do not think that be the right answer do not believe legalize narcotic be the answer just do not believe that be the answer do believe that there be some fairly good news out there the use of cocaine for example by teenager be dramatically down but have get to keep fight on this war against drug be do a little well in interdiction many of the country that use to say well this be a united|states problem if would get the demand down then would not have the problem be work cooperatively with the dea and other law the military be use the military more now in term of interdiction funding for recovery be up recover the addict where be not make the progress sander be in be make in teenager and thank god because think what ross say be most appropriate about these family and these child but where be not make be with the confirm addict will tell place that be work well and that be the private sector jim|burke and this task force that have may know about tell the american people but this man say will get a dollar a day in advertising something that be very hard for the government to do go out and do and people be begin to educate through this program teach these kid should not use drug so be still in the fight but must tell think legalization of narcotic or something of that nature in the face of the medical evidence would be totally counterproductive and oppose and be go to stand up and continue to oppose mr. lehrer mr. perot one|minute mr. perot any time think want to legalize drug go to a neonatal unit if can get in be between|100 and percent capacity up and down the|east|coast and the reason be crack baby be bear baby be in the hospital typical cost to and be again and again and again the mother disappear in and the child become a ward of the state because be permanently and genetically damage just look at those little child and if anybody can even think about legalize drug have lose now let look at priority go on the libyan raid remember that one because be worried to death that qadhafi may be build up chemical weapon have get chemical warfare be conduct against child on the street in this country all|day every|day and do not have the will to stamp out again if get up there if send be go to have some blunt talk about this be really go to get out in the trench and say be this one want to talk about or fix because talk will not do folk there be guy that could not get a job third shift in a drive bmw 's and mercedes sell drug these old boy be not go to quit easy mr. lehrer governor clinton one|minute governor clinton like mr. perot have hold crack baby in arm but know more about this think than anybody else up here because have a brother who be a recover drug addict be very proud of but can tell this if drug be legal do not think would be alive today be adamantly oppose to legalize drug be alive today because of the criminal justice system that be a mistake what should do first ought to prevent more of this on the street thirty|years|ago there be policeman for every crime now there be crime for every policeman need more police on the street have a plan for that secondly ought to have treatment on demand thirdly ought to have boot camp for first time nonviolent offender so can get discipline and treatment and education and get reconnecte to the community before be sever and send to prison where can learn how to be first class criminal there be a crime bill that lamentably be block from passage once again mostly by republicans in the|united|states|senate which would have address some of these problem that crime bill be go to be of high priority next|january if become president mr. lehrer next question be to mr. perot have 2|minute to answer and john will ask racial harmony mr. mashek mr. perot racial division continue to tear apart great city the last episode be this|spre in los|angeles why be this still happen in america and what would do to end mr. perot this be a relevant question here tonight first thing would do be during political campaign would urge everybody to stop try to split this country into fragment and appeal to the difference between and then wonder why the melting pot 's all break to piece after november the be all in this together ought to love another because united team win and divide team lose if can not love another ought to get along with another if can not get there just recognize be all stuck with another because nobody be go anywhere right now that ought to get everybody back up to let get along together and make work diversity be a strength have turn into a weakness now again the|white|house be a bully pulpit think whoever be in the|white|house should just make absolutely unconscionable and inexcusable and if anybody be in the middle of a speech at know of these convention would expect the candidate to go out and lift off the stage if start preach hate because do not have time for difference be strength have get to pull together in athletic know see divided team lose united team win have get to unite and pull together and there be nothing can not do but if sit around blow all this energy out the window on racial strife and hatred be stick with a sure loser because have be a melting pot be become more and more of a melting pot let make a strength not a weakness mr. lehrer governor clinton one|minute governor clinton grow up in the segregated south thankfully raise by a grandfather with almost no formal education but with a heart of gold who teach early that all people be equal in the eye of god see the wind of hatred divide people and keep the people of state poorer than would have be spiritually and economically have do everything could in public life to overcome racial division do not have a person to waste in this country be be murder economically because have too many dropout have too many low birth weight baby have too many drug addict as kid have too much violence be too divide by race by income by region have devote a major portion of this campaign to go across this country and look for opportunity to go to white group and african american group and latino group asian american group and say the same thing if the american people can not be bring together can not turn this country around if can come

not have any civil right legislation have try to use the|white|house as a bully pulpit speak out against discrimination pass very forward look civil right bill be not go to be all do by legislation but do think that need to make an appeal every time can to eliminate racial division and discrimination and will keep on do that and point to some legislative accomplishment to back up have to take here at the end the red light be not on yet to say to ross|perot please do not say to the dea agent on the street that do not have the will to fight drug please have watch these people the same for local law enforcement people be back in every way possibly can but maybe mean that some in the country do not have the will to fight but those that be out there on the front line as know have be a strong backer of law enforcement really just want to clear that up have the will to fight and frankly some of be give life mr. lehrer time mr. president all right let go now to another subject the

do a superb job in destroy the myth about aids all of be in this fight together all of care do not go to the extreme mr. lehrer one|minute mr. perot mr. perot first think mary|fisher be a great choice be lucky to have head the commission secondly think thing that if be send to do the job would sit down with fda look exactly where be then would really focus on let get these thing out if be go to die do not have to go through this 10-year cycle that fda go through on new drug believe people with aids be more than willing to take that risk could be move out to the human population a whole lot faster than be on some of these new drug so think can expedite the problem there let go back a minute to racial divisiveness all time low in country be the judge thomas anita|hill hearing and those senator ought to be hang head in shame for what do there second thing there be not many time in life when get to talk to a whole country but let just say this to all of america if hate people do not want vote that be how strongly feel about mr. lehrer governor clinton one|minute governor clinton americans have die of aids well over a and a quarter americans be hiv positive need to put person in charge of the battle against aids to cut across all the agency that deal with need to accelerate the drug approval process need to fully fund the act name for that wonderful boy ryan|white to make sure be do everything can on research and treatment the president should lead a national effort to change behavior to keep child alive in the school responsible behavior to keep people alive this be a matter of life and death have work in state to reduce teen pregnancy and illness among child and know be tough the reason magic|johnson resign from the|aids|commission be because the statement hear tonight from mr. bush be the long and good statement be make about in public be proud of what do at the|democratic|convention put hiv positive people on the platform and be proud of the leadership that be go to bring to this country in deal with the aids crisis mr. lehrer new question for mr. perot have 2|minute to answer and ann will ask entitlement program ms. compton mr. perot even if have get what people say be the gut to take on change in the most popular and the most sacred of the entitlement medicare people say have not a prayer of actually get anything pass in washington since the president be not a lone|ranger how in the world can make some of those unpopular change mr. perot way number if get there will be a very unusual and historical event because laughter because the people not the special interest put there will have a unique mandate have say again and again and this really upset the establishment in washington that be go to inform the people in detail on the issue through an electronic town hall so that really know what be go on will want to do what be good for country now all these fellow with dollar suit and alligator shoe run up and down the|halls|of|congress that make policy now the lobbyist the pac guy the foreign lobbyist what have will be over there in the smithsonian laughter because be go to get rid of the congress will be listen to the people and the american people be willing to have fair share sacrifice be not as stupid as washington think be the american people be bright intelligent care love people who want a great country for child and grandchild will make those sacrifice so welcome that challenge and just watch because if the american people send there will get do now everybody will faint in washington have never see anything happen in that town this be a town where the|white|house say congress do congress say the|white|house do and be sit there and say well who else could be around and then when get off by say nobody do and yet the cash register be empty and use to have money the taxpayer ' money in and do not get the result will get do mr. lehrer governor one|minute governor clinton ross that be a great speech but be not quite that mean look at the fact both party in washington the president and the congress have cut medicare the average senior citizen be spend a high percentage of income on health care today than be in before medicare come in the president 's get another proposal to require to pay a year more for the|next|5|year but if do not have the gut to control cost by change the insurance system and take on the bureaucracy and the regulation of health care in the private and public sector can not fix this problem cost will continue to spiral just remember this folk a lot of folk on medicare be out there every|day make the choice between food and medicine not poor enough for medicare medicaid not wealthy enough to buy medicine have meet people like mary|annie and edward|davis of nashua new|hampshire all over this country can not even buy medicine so let be careful when talk about cut health care cost let start with the insurance company and the people that be make a killing instead of make people healthy mr. lehrer one|minute president bush president bush well first place would like to clear up something because every|4|year the democrats go around and say hey republicans be go to cut social|security and medicare have start again be the president that stand up and say do not mess with social|security and be not go to and have not be not go to go after the social|security recipient have difference with mr. perot on that because do not think need to touch social|security what do need to do though be control the growth of these mandatory program and ross properly say okay there be some pain in that but governor clinton refuse to touch that simply refuse so what have get to do be control the growth let grow for inflation let grow for the amount of new people add population and then hold the line believe that be the way get the deficit down not by the tax and spend program that hear every|4|year whether be whoever else be just do not believe ought to do that so hold the line on social|security and put a cap on the growth of the mandatory program mr. lehrer new question be for governor clinton answer sandy will ask health care cost mr. vanocur governor clinton ann|compton have bring up medicare remember in when wilbur|mill of arkansas the chairman of ways|and|mean be push through the congress the charge against be be socialized medicine never governor clinton mr. bush make that charge mr. vanocur well serve with 2|years|later|in|1967 where first meet the second point though be that be now skyrocket out of control people want say be go bonker be not the oregon plan apply to medicaid ration the proper way to go even though last|august rule that violate the americans with disabilities act of governor clinton think the oregon plan should at least have be allow to be try because at least the people in oregon be try to do something let go back to the main point sandy mr. bush be try to run against lyndon|johnson and jimmy|carter and everybody in the world but in this race have propose a manage competition plan for health care will say again can not control health care cost simply by cut medicare look what be happen the|federal|government have cut medicare and medicaid in the|last|few|year state have cut medicaid have do in arkansas under budget pressure but what happen more and more people get on the roll as poverty increase if do not control the health care cost of the entire system can not get control of look at program have set up a national ceiling on health care cost tie to inflation and population growth set by health care provider not by the government provide for manage competition not government model in every state and control private and public health care cost now just a|few|days|ago a bipartisan commission of republicans and democrats more republicans than democrats say plan will save the average family a year more than the bush plan will by the|year|2000 in the|next|12|year a year by have get a plan to control health care cost but can not just do by cut medicare have to take on the insurance company the bureaucracy and have to have cost control yes but keep in mind be spend more on health care than any country in the world any other country yet have people uninsured have no preventive and primary care the oregon plan be a good start if the|federal|government be go to continue to abandon responsibility say if germany can cover everybody and keep cost under inflation if hawaii can cover of people at low health care cost than the rest of if rochester new|york can do with third of the cost of the rest of america can do too be try of be tell can not say can can do better and must mr. lehrer president bush one|minute president bush well do not have time in to talk about health care reform plan the oregon plan make some good sense but be easy to dismiss the concern of the disabled as president have to be sure that those waiver which be approve all over the place be cover under the law maybe can work out but the americans for disabilities act speak about sound and sensible civil right legislation be the foremost piece of legislation pass in modern time so do have something more than a technical problem governor clinton click off the thing have get to take on insurance company and bureaucracy fail to take on somebody else the malpractice suit people those that bring these lawsuit against these frivolous trial lawyer ' lawsuit that be run cost of medical care up by refuse to put anything control on these crazy lawsuit if want to help somebody do not run the cost up by make doctor have to have or test where one would do for fear of be sue or have somebody along the highway not stop to pick up a guy and help because be afraid a trial lawyer will come along and sue be sue each other too much and care for each other too little mr. lehrer mr. perot one|minute mr. perot have get the most expensive health care system in the world rank behind other nation when come to life expectancy and other nation when come to infant mortality so do not have the good pretty simple folk if be pay more and do not have the good if all else fail go copy the people who have the good who spend less right but can do better than that again have get plan lie all over the place in washington nobody ever implement now be back to square if want to stop talk about and do then will be glad to go up there and will get do but if just want to keep the music go just stay traditional this next time around and will have everybody

soviet bear may be go but there be still wolf in the wood see that when saddam|hussein invade kuwait the mideast may have become a nuclear powder keg energy supply hold hostage so do what be right and

look forward to open new market prepare people to compete to restore social fabric to save and invest so can win believe that now that the world look more like america be time for america to look more like and so offer a philosophy that put faith in the individual not the bureaucracy a philosophy that empower people to do good so america can be at good in a world that be safe and free this be how will build an america that be strong safe and more secure start with a simple fact government be too big and spend too much have ask congress to put a lid on mandatory spending except social|security have propose do away with over|200 program and wasteful project and to freeze all other spending the gridlock democrat congress say no audience member boo o o the president so begin tonight will enforce the spending freeze on own if congress send a bill spend more than ask for in budget will veto fast veto fast faster than copy of millie 's book sell now congress will not cut spending but refuse to give the president the power to eliminate pork barrel project that waste money governors have that power so ask the american people give a congress that will give the line item veto let tell about a recent battle fight with the congress a battle in which be aid by bob|michel and troop and bob|dole and this|spring work day and night to get third of the house members to approve a balanced budget amendment to the constitution almost have but lose by just|nine vote now listen how just before the vote the liberal leader of the congress convince member who cosponsor the bill to switch side and vote no keep in mind vote against a bill have already put name on something fishy be go on and look at opponent on this issue look at opponent say be for balanced budget but come out against the amendment be like that on a lot of issue first on side then the other be be spot in more place than elvis|presley after all these year congress have become pretty creative at find way to waste money so need to be just as creative at find way to stop have a brandnew idea taxpayer should be give the right to check a box on tax return so that up|to|10|percent of payment can go for purpose alone to reduce the national debt but also need to make sure that congress do not just turn around and borrow more money to spend more money so will require that for every tax dollar set aside to cut the debt the ceiling on spending will be cut by an equal amount that way will cut both debt and spending and take a whack out of the budget deficit feeling about big government come from experience spend half adult life in the private sector opponent have a different experience be be in government nearly all life passion to expand government know no bound be already propose and listen to this carefully have already propose in new spending along with the big tax increase in history and that be just to start audience member boo o o the president say want to tax the rich but folk define rich as anyone who have a job laughter have hear of the separation of power well opponent practice a different theory the power of separation government have the power to separate from wallet laughter now let say this when come to taxis have learn the hard way there be an old saying good judgment come from experience and experience come from bad judgment two|years|ago make a bad call on the democrats tax increase underestimate congress ' addiction to taxis with back against the wall agree to a hard bargain tax increase time in return for the tough spending limit ever well be a mistake to go along with the democratic tax increase and admit but here be the question for the american people who do trust in this election the candidate who be raise taxis time and regret or the other candidate who raise taxis and fee time and enjoy every time audience member viva bush viva|bush viva|bush the president thank very much audience member hit again hit again hard harder hit again hit again hard harder the president when the new congress convene next|january will propose to further reduce taxis across the board provide pay for these cut with specific spending reduction that consider appropriate so that do not increase the deficit will also continue to fight to increase the personal exemption and to create job by win a cut in capital gain taxis that will especially help small business know create small business create third of the new job in america but opponent 's plan for small business be clear present and dangerous beside new income taxis plan will lead to a new payroll tax to pay for a government takeover of health care and another new tax to pay for training that be just the beginning if get way hardware store across america will have a new sign up close for despair guess would say plan really be elvis economic america will be check into the believe that small business need relief from taxation regulation and litigation and thus will extend for one|year the freeze on paperwork and unnecessary federal regulation that impose last|winter there be no reason that federal regulation should live longer than friend george|burn will issue an order to get rid of any rule whose time have come and go see something happen in town and in neighborhood sharp lawyer be run wild doctor be afraid to practice medicine and some mom and pop will not even coach little|league any more must sue each other less and care for each other more be fight to reform legal system to put an end to crazy lawsuit if that mean climb into the ring with the trial lawyer well let just say round start

to provide affordable health care for every american control cost by cut paperwork and lawsuit and expand coverage to the poor of the poor do not need opponent 's plan for a massive government takeover of health care which would ration care and deny the right to choose a doctor who want health care with a system with the efficiency of the house post office and the compassion of the kgb what about school what about school opponent and both want to change the way kid learn want to change school a little bit and want to change a lot take the issue of whether parent should be able to choose the good school for kid opponent say that be okay as long as the school be run by government and say every parent and child should have a real choice of school public private or religious so have a clear choice to fix problem do turn to the tattered blanket of bureaucracy that other nation be toss away or do give people the freedom and incentive to build security for here be what be fight for open market for american product low government spending tax relief opportunity for small business legal and health reform job training and new school build on competition ready for the|21st|century now okay why be these proposal not in effect today only|one reason the gridlock democratic congress audience member clean house clean house clean house the president a very good idea a very good idea now know americans be tired of the blame game tired of people in washington act like be candidate for the next episode of american|gladiator do not like either neither should but the truth be the truth policy have not fail have not even be try americans want job and on january|28th put before congress a plan to create job if would be pass back then more americans would be at work right now but in a nation that demand action congress have become the master of inaction be not always this way hear president ford tonight serve in congress under and back then cooperate do not get personal put

extend hand to the congressional leader the democratic leader and bite the house leadership have not change in be a body catch in a hopelessly tangle web of pac 's perk privilege partnership and paralysis every|day congress put politic ahead of principle and above progress now let give just example be at the height of the|gulf|war on that very same day ask american pilot to risk life to fly mission over baghdad also want to strengthen economic security for the future so that very same day introduce a new domestic energy strategy which would cut dependence on foreign oil by 7|million|barrel a day how many day do take to win the|gulf|war how many do take congress to pass a national energy strategy five|hundred|and|thirty and still count have ride stationary bike that can move faster than the|united|stat house|of|representatif and the united states senate control by the democrat leadership audience member hit again hit again hard harder hit again hit again hard harder
