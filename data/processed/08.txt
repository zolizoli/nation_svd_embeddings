awe of and be grateful for the man and woman who make up the fine fighting force the world have ever know & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;but worry if think that the entire burden of engagement with the world be up to who serve in military and the rest of can just sit back and do nothing & nbsp;they can not shoulder the entire burden & nbsp;and engagement mean use all the lever of national power and rally the world to take on share challenge & nbsp look at something like trade for example & nbsp;we live in an age of global supply chain and cargo ship that crisscross ocean and online commerce that can render border obsolete & nbsp;and a lot of folk have legitimate concern with the way globalization have progress that be of the change that be be take place job ship overseas trade deal that sometimes put worker and business at a disadvantage & nbsp;but the answer be not to stop trade with other country & nbsp;in this global economy that ’s not even possible & nbsp;the answer be to do trade the right way by negotiate with other country so that raise labor standard and environmental standard and make sure do not impose unfair tariff on american good or steal american intellectual property &

on a level playing field & nbsp building wall will not do that applause & nbsp;it will not boost economy and will not enhance security either & nbsp;isolating or disparage muslims suggest that should be treat differently when come to enter this country applause that be not just a betrayal of value applause that be not just a betrayal of who be would alienate the very community at home and abroad who be most important partner in the fight against violent extremism & nbsp suggest that can build an endless wall along border and blame challenge on immigrant that do not just run counter to history as the world ’s melting pot contradict the evidence that growth and innovation and dynamism have always be spur by ability to attract striver from every corner of the globe & nbsp;that be how become america & nbsp;why would want to stop now & nbsp;(applause & nbsp & nbsp audience member & more year the president & nbsp;can't do & nbsp;(laughter.)&nbsp which bring to third point & nbsp;fact evidence reason logic an understanding of science these be good thing & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;these be quality want in people make policy & nbsp;these be quality want to continue to cultivate in yourself as citizen & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;that may seem obvious laughter & nbsp;that be why honor bill|moyer or dr. burnell traditionally have value those thing & nbsp;but if be listen to today ’s political debate may wonder where this strain of anti - intellectualism come from & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;so class of let be as clear as can be & politic and in life ignorance be not a virtue & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;it be not cool to not know what be talk about & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;that be not keep real or tell like be & nbsp;(laughter & nbsp;that be not challenge political correctness & nbsp;that be just not know what be talk about & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;and yet have become confused about this & nbsp & nbsp & nbsp & nbsp & nbsp look nation’s|founder franklin madison hamilton jefferson be bear of the enlightenment & nbsp;they seek to escape superstition and sectarianism and tribalism and no nothingness & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;they believe in rational thought and experimentation and the capacity of informed citizen to master own fate & nbsp;that be embed in constitutional design & nbsp;that spirit inform inventor and explorer the edisons and the|wright|brother and the|george|washington|carver and the grace hoppers and the|norman|borlaug and the steve jobses & nbsp;that be what build this country and today in every phone in of pocket laughter have access to more information than at any time in human history at a touch of a button & nbsp;but ironically the flood of information have not make more discerning of the truth in some way ’s just make more confident in ignorance applause & nbsp;we assume whatever be on the web must be true & nbsp;we search for site that just reinforce own predisposition opinion masquerade as fact & nbsp;the wild conspiracy theory be take for gospel & nbsp now understand be sure have learn during year of college and if not will learn soon that there be a whole lot of folk who be book smart and have no common sense & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;that be the truth & nbsp;you’ll meet if have not already & nbsp;(laughter & nbsp;so the fact that have get a fancy degree get to talk to to see whether know what be talk about & nbsp;(laughter & nbsp;qualities like kindness and compassion honesty hard work often matter more than technical skill or know how & nbsp;(applause & nbsp & nbsp but when leader express a disdain for fact when be not hold accountable for repeat falsehood and just make stuff up while actual expert be dismiss as elitist then have get a problem & nbsp;(applause & nbsp know be interesting that if get sick actually want to make sure the doctor have go to medical school know what be talk about & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;if get on a plane say really want a pilot to be able to pilot the plane & nbsp;(laughter & nbsp;and yet in public life certainly think “ do not want somebody who ’s do and applause & nbsp;the rejection of fact the rejection of reason and science that be the path to decline & nbsp;it call to mind the word of carl|sagan who graduate high school here in new|jersey applause say & nbsp;“we can judge progress by the courage of question and the depth of answer willingness to embrace what be true rather than what feel good.”&nbsp the debate around climate change be a perfect example of this & nbsp;now recognize do not feel like the planet be warm right now & nbsp;(laughter & nbsp;i understand & nbsp;there be hail when land in newark & nbsp;(laughter & nbsp;(the wind start blow hard & nbsp;(laughter & nbsp but think about the climate change issue & nbsp;every|day there be official in high office with responsibility who mock the overwhelming consensus of the world ’s scientist that human activity and the release of carbon dioxide and methane and other substance be alter climate in profound and dangerous way & nbsp a while back may have see a united|states senator trot out a snowball during a floor speech in the|middle|of|winter as proof that the world be not warm & nbsp;(laughter & nbsp;i mean listen climate change be not something subject to political spin & nbsp;there be evidence & nbsp;there be fact & nbsp;we can see happen right now & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;if do not act if do not follow through on the progress make in paris the progress have be make here at home generation will feel the brunt of this catastrophe & nbsp so ’ up to to insist upon and shape an informed debate & nbsp;imagine if benjamin|franklin have see that senator with the snowball what would think & nbsp;imagine if 5th grade science teacher have see that & nbsp;(laughter & nbsp;he’d get a d.|&nbsp;(laughter & nbsp;and ’s a senator & nbsp;(laughter look be not suggest that cold analysis and hard datum be ultimately more important in life than passion or faith or love or loyalty & nbsp;i be suggest that those high expression of humanity can only flourish when economy function well and propose budget add up and environment be protect & nbsp;and to accomplish those thing to make collective decision on behalf of a common good have to use head & nbsp;we have to agree that fact and evidence matter & nbsp;and get to hold leader and accountable to know what the heck be talk about & nbsp;(applause & nbsp & nbsp all right & nbsp;i only have more point & nbsp;i know be get cold and guy have to graduate & nbsp;(laughter & nbsp;point & nbsp;have faith in democracy & nbsp;look know ’s not always pretty & nbsp really know & nbsp;(laughter & nbsp;i've be live & nbsp;but ’s how bit by bit generation by generation have make progress in this nation & nbsp;that be how ban child labor & nbsp;that be how clean up air and water & nbsp;that be how pass program like social|security and medicare that lift million of senior out of poverty & nbsp;(applause & nbsp & nbsp none of these change happen overnight & nbsp;they do not happen because some charismatic leader get everybody suddenly to agree on everything & nbsp;it do not happen because some massive political revolution occur & nbsp;it actually happen over the course of year of advocacy and organizing and alliance building and deal making and the changing of public opinion & nbsp;it happen because ordinary americans who care participate in the political process & nbsp;&nbsp audience member & nbsp;because of & nbsp;(applause & nbsp the president & nbsp;well that be nice & nbsp;i mean help but applause look if want to change this country for the well well start participate & give an example on a lot of people ’s mind right now and that ’s the grow inequality in economy & nbsp;over much of the|last|century have unleash the strong economic engine the world have ever see but over the|past|few|decade economy have become more and more unequal & nbsp;the top of earner now take in half of all income in the u.s.|&nbsp;in the past use to be a top ceo make or time the income of the average worker & nbsp;today ’s time more & nbsp;and wage be not rise fast enough for million of hardworke family & nbsp now if want to reverse those trend there be a bunch of policy that would make a real difference & nbsp;we can raise the minimum wage & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;we can modernize infrastructure can invest in early childhood education & nbsp;we can make college more affordable & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;we can close tax loophole on hedge fund manager and take that money and give tax break to help family with child care or retirement & nbsp;and if do these thing then would help to restore the sense that hard work be reward and could build an economy that truly work for everybody & nbsp;(applause & nbsp now the reason some of these thing have not happen even though the majority of people approve of be really simple be not because be not propose & nbsp;it be not because the fact and the evidence show would not work & nbsp;it be because a huge chunk of americans especially young people do not vote & nbsp in voter turnout be the low since world|war|ii & nbsp;fewe than in young people show up to vote & nbsp;and the who stay home determine the course of this country just as much as the single who vote & nbsp;because apathy have consequence & nbsp;it determine who congress be & nbsp;it determine what policy prioritize & nbsp;it even for example determine whether a really highly qualified supreme|court nominee receive the courtesy of a hearing and a vote in the united|states senate & nbsp;(applause & nbsp & nbsp and yes big money in politic be a huge problem & nbsp;we've get to reduce influence & nbsp;yes special interest and lobbyist have disproportionate access to the corridor of power but contrary to what hear sometimes from both the left as well as the right the system be not as rig as think and certainly be not as hopeless as think & nbsp;politicians care about be elect and especially care about be reelect & nbsp;and if vote and elect a majority that represent view will get what want & nbsp;and if opt out or stop pay attention will not & nbsp;it ’s that simple applause & nbsp;it be not that complicated.&nbsp now of the reason that people do not vote be because do not see the change be look for right away & nbsp;well guess what none of the great stride in history happen right away & nbsp;it take and the naacp decade to win brown|v.|board|of|education and then another|decade after that to secure the|civil|rights|act and the|voting|rights|act & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;and take more time after that for to start work & nbsp;it take a proud daughter of new|jersey alice|paul year of organize march and hunger strike and protest and draft hundred of piece of legislation and write letter and give speech and work with congressional leader before and other suffragette finally help win woman the right to vote & nbsp;(applause & nbsp each stage along the way require compromise & nbsp;sometimes take half a loaf & nbsp;you forge ally & lose on an issue and then come back to fight another|day & nbsp;that ’s how democracy work & nbsp;so have get to be commit to participate not just if get immediate gratification but get to be a citizen full time all the time & nbsp & nbsp and if participation mean voting and mean compromise and organizing and advocacy also mean listen to those who do not agree with & nbsp;i know a|couple|years|ago folk on this campus get upset that condoleezza|rice be suppose to speak at a commencement & nbsp;now do not think be a secret that disagree with many of the foreign policy of dr. rice and the previous administration & nbsp;but the notion that this community or the country would be better serve by not hear from a former secretary of state or shut out what have to say believe that ’s misguided & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;i do not think that be how democracy work best when be not even willing to listen to each other & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;i believe that be misguided & nbsp if disagree with somebody bring in applause)&nbsp;-- and ask tough question & nbsp;hold foot to the fire & nbsp;make defend position & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;if somebody have get a bad or offensive idea prove wrong & nbsp;engage & nbsp;debate & nbsp;stand up for what believe in & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;don't be scared to take somebody on & nbsp;don't feel like got to shut ear off because be too fragile and somebody may offend sensibility & nbsp;go at if be not make any sense use logic and reason and word & nbsp;and by do so will strengthen own position and will hone argument & nbsp;and maybe will learn something and realize do not know everything & nbsp;and may have a new understanding not only about what opponent believe but maybe what believe & nbsp;either way win & nbsp;and more importantly democracy win & nbsp;(applause & nbsp so anyway all right & nbsp;that be class of laughter a few suggestion on how can change the world except maybe have get last suggestion & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;just & nbsp;and that is gear for the long haul & nbsp;whatever path choose business nonprofit government education health care the art whatever be be go to have some setback & nbsp;you will deal occasionally with foolish people & nbsp;you will be frustrate & nbsp;you’ll have a boss that be not great & nbsp;you will not always get everything want at least not as fast as want & nbsp;so have to stick with & nbsp;you have to be persistent & nbsp;and success however small however incomplete success be still success & nbsp;i always tell daughter know better be good & nbsp;it may not be perfect may not be great but be good & nbsp;that be how progress happen in society and in own life & nbsp so do not lose hope if sometimes hit a roadblock & nbsp;don't lose hope in the face of naysayer & nbsp;and certainly do not let resistance make cynical & nbsp;cynicism be so easy and cynic do not accomplish much & nbsp;a a friend of mine who happen to be from new|jersey a guy name bruce|springsteen once sing applause “ spend life wait for a moment that just do not come & nbsp;don’t let that be & nbsp;don’t waste time wait & nbsp if doubt can make a difference look at the impact some of fellow graduate be already make & nbsp;look at what matthew be do & nbsp;look at somebody like yasmin|ramadan who begin organize anti - bullying assembly when be to help kid handle bias and discrimination and here at rutgers help find the|muslim|public|relations|council to work with

applause.)&nbsp in most famous poem jose|marti make this offering of friendship and peace to both friend and enemy.&nbsp today as the president of the|united|states|of|america offer the cuban people el de paz.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp havana be from florida but to get here have to travel a great distance over barrier of history and ideology barrier of pain and separation.&nbsp the blue water beneath once carry american battleship to this island to liberate but also to exert control over cuba.&nbsp those water also carry generation of cuban revolutionary to the|united|state where build support for cause.&nbsp and that short distance have be cross by hundreds|of|thousands of cuban exile on plane and makeshift raft who come to america in pursuit of freedom and opportunity sometimes leave behind everything own and every person that love like so many people in both of country lifetime have span a time of isolation between us.&nbsp the|cuban|revolution take place the|same|year that father come to the|united|state from kenya.&nbsp the|bay|of|pigs take place the|year that be bear the|next|year the entire world hold breath watch country as humanity come as close as ever have to the horror of

between the|united|state and cuba have come here to bury the last remnant of in the americas.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp have come here to extend the hand of friendship to the cuban people.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp want to be clear:&nbsp the difference between government over these|many|year be real and be important.&nbsp be sure president castro would say the same thing know because have hear address those difference at length.&nbsp but before discuss those issue also need to recognize how much share.&nbsp because in many way the|united|state and cuba be like brother who have be estrange for many|years even as share the same blood both live in a new world colonize by europeans.&nbsp cuba like the|united|state be build in part by slave bring here from africa.&nbsp like the|united|state the cuban people can trace heritage to both slave and slave owners.&nbsp have welcome both immigrant who come a great distance to start new life in the americas over the|year culture have blend together.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp dr. carlos|finlay ’s work in cuba pave the way for generation of doctor include walter|reed who draw on dr. finlay ’s work to help combat yellow

and later today player will compete on the same havana field that jackie|robinson play on before make debut.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp and be say that great boxer muhammad|ali once pay tribute to a cuban that could never fight say that would only be able to reach a draw with the great cuban teofilo stevenson.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp so even as government become adversary people continue to share these common passion particularly as so many cubans come to america.&nbsp in miami or havana can find place to dance cha cha or the salsa and eat ropa vieja.&nbsp people in both of country have sing along with celia|cruz or gloria|estefan and now listen to reggaeton or pitbull.&nbsp laughter.)&nbsp million of people share a common religion a faith that pay tribute to at the shrine of lady|of|charity in miami a peace that cubans find in for all of difference the cuban and american people share common value in own lives.&nbsp a sense of patriotism and a sense of pride a lot of pride.&nbsp a profound love of family.&nbsp a passion for child a commitment to education.&nbsp and that be why believe grandchild will look back on this period of isolation as an aberration as just chapter in a long story of family and of friendship but can not and should not ignore the very real difference that have about how organize government economy and societies.&nbsp cuba have a party system the|united|states be a multi - party democracy.&nbsp cuba have a socialist economic model the|united|states be an open market.&nbsp cuba have emphasize the role and right of the state the|united|states be found upon the right of the individual despite these difference on december|17th|2014 president castro and announce that the|united|state and cuba would begin a process to normalize relation between countries.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp since then have establish diplomatic relation and open embassies.&nbsp have begin initiative to cooperate on health and agriculture education and law enforcement.&nbsp have reach agreement to restore direct flight and mail service.&nbsp have expand commercial tie and increase the capacity of americans to travel and do business in cuba and these change have be welcome even though there be still opponent to these policies.&nbsp but still many people on both side of this debate have asked:&nbsp why why now there be simple answer:&nbsp what the|united|state be do be not working.&nbsp have to have the courage to acknowledge that truth.&nbsp a policy of isolation design for make little sense in the 21st century.&nbsp the embargo be only hurt the cuban people instead of help them.&nbsp and have always believe in what martin|luther|king jr. call “ the fierce urgency of now should not fear change should embrace it.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp that lead to a big and more important reason for these changes:&nbsp creo el pueblo cubano.&nbsp believe in the cuban people.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp this be not just a policy of normalizing relation with the cuban government.&nbsp the|united|states|of|america be normalize relation with the cuban people.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp and today want to share with vision of what future can be.&nbsp want the cuban people especially the young people to understand why believe that should look to the future with hope not the false promise which insist that thing be well than really be or the blind optimism that say all problem can go away tomorrow.&nbsp hope that be root in the future that can choose and that can shape and that can build for country.&nbsp;&nbsp be hopeful because believe that the cuban people be as innovative as any people in the world in a global economy power by idea and information a country ’s great asset be people.&nbsp in the|united|state have a clear monument to what the cuban people can build ’s call miami.&nbsp here in havana see that same talent in cuentapropista cooperative and old car that still run.&nbsp inventa aire.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp cuba have an extraordinary resource a system of education which value every boy and every girl.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp and in recent|years the cuban government have begin to open up to the world and to open up more space for that talent to in just|a|few|year have see how cuentapropista can succeed while sustain a distinctly cuban spirit.&nbsp be self employ be not about become more like america ’s about be look at sandra|lidice|aldama who choose to start a small business.&nbsp cubans say can “ innovate and adapt without lose identity secret be in not copy or imitating but simply be look at papito|valladere a barber whose success allow to improve condition in neighborhood.&nbsp realize be not go to solve all of the world ’s problem said.&nbsp “ but if can solve problem in the little piece of the world where live can ripple across havana that ’s where hope begin with the ability to earn own living and to build something can be proud that ’s why policy focus on support cubans instead of hurt them.&nbsp that ’s why get rid of limit on remittance so ordinary cubans have more resources.&nbsp that ’s why be encouraging travel which will build bridge between people and bring more revenue to those cuban small business that ’s why have open up space for commerce and exchange so that americans and cubans can work together to find cure for disease and create job and open the door to more opportunity for the cuban people.&nbsp as president of the|united|state have call on congress to lift the embargo.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp be an outdated burden on the cuban people.&nbsp be a burden on the americans who want to work and do business or invest here in cuba.&nbsp be time to lift the embargo.&nbsp but even if lift the embargo tomorrow cubans would not realize potential without continue change here in cuba.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp should be easy to open a business here in cuba.&nbsp a worker should be able to get a job directly with company who invest here in cuba.&nbsp currency should not separate the type of salary that cubans can earn.&nbsp the internet should be available across the island so that cubans can connect to the wide world applause and to of the great engine of growth in human history there ’s no limitation from the|united|state on the ability of cuba to take these steps.&nbsp ’ up to you.&nbsp and can tell as a friend that sustainable prosperity in the|21st|century depend upon education health care and environmental protection.&nbsp but also depend on the free and open exchange of ideas.&nbsp if can not access information online if can not be expose to different point of view will not reach full potential.&nbsp and over time the youth will lose hope know these issue be sensitive especially come from an american president.&nbsp before some americans see cuba as something to exploit ignore poverty enable corruption.&nbsp and since have be shadow boxer in this battle of geopolitic and personalities.&nbsp know the history but refuse to be trap by applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp have make clear that the|united|states have neither the capacity nor the intention to impose change on cuba.&nbsp what change come will depend upon the cuban people.&nbsp will not impose political or economic system on you.&nbsp recognize that every country every people must chart own course and shape own model.&nbsp but have remove the shadow of history from relationship must speak honestly about the thing that believe the thing that as americans believe.&nbsp as marti say “ liberty be the right of every man to be honest to think and to speak without hypocrisy so let tell what believe.&nbsp can not force to agree but should know what think.&nbsp believe that every person should be equal under the law applause.)&nbsp every child deserve the dignity that come with education and health care and food on the table and a roof over heads.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp believe citizen should be free to speak mind without fear applause to organize and to criticize government and to protest peacefully and that the rule of law should not include arbitrary detention of people who exercise those rights.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp believe that every person should have the freedom to practice faith peacefully and publicly applause.)&nbsp and yes believe voter should be able to choose government in free and democratic elections.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp not everybody agree with on this.&nbsp not everybody agree with the american people on this.&nbsp but believe those human right be universal.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp believe be the right of the american people the cuban people and people around the world now there ’s no secret that government disagree on many of these issues.&nbsp have have frank conversation with president castro.&nbsp for many|years have point out the flaw in the american system economic inequality the death penalty racial discrimination war that ’s just a sample.&nbsp have a much long list.&nbsp laughter.)&nbsp but here ’s what the cuban people need to understand:&nbsp welcome this open debate and dialogue ’ good.&nbsp ’s healthy.&nbsp be not afraid of do have too much money in american politics.&nbsp but in

in the middle of the long streak of private sector job creation in history.&nbsp;(applause.)&nbsp;more|than|14|million new job the strong two|year of job growth since the 90 an unemployment rate cut

almost|three quarters.&nbsp;(applause anyone claim that america ’s economy be in decline be peddle fiction applause now what be true and the reason that a lot of americans feel be that the economy have be change in profound way change that start long&nbsp;before the&nbsp;great recession hit change that have not let up today technology do not just replace job on the assembly line but any job where work can be automated.&nbsp;company in a global economy can locate anywhere and face tough competition as a result worker have less leverage for a raise.&nbsp;company have less loyalty to community and more and more wealth and income be concentrate at the very top all these trend have squeeze worker even when have job even when the economy be grow ’s make harder for a hardworking family to pull out of poverty hard for young people to start career tough for worker to retire when want to and although none of these trend be unique to america do offend uniquely american belief that everybody who work hard should get a fair shot for the|past|seven|years goal have be a grow economy that work also better for everybody have make progress but need to make more and despite all the political argument that have have these|past|few|year there be actually some area where americans broadly agree agree that real opportunity require every american to get the education and training need to land a good pay job.&nbsp;the bipartisan reform of no|child|left|behind be an important start and together have increase early childhood high school graduation rate to new highs,&nbsp;boosted

college at no cost for every responsible student be of the good way to do that and be go to keep fight to get that start this|year applause be the right thing to do applause but a great education be not all need in this new economy also need benefit and protection that provide a basic measure of security ’s not too much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in america who be go to work the same job in the same place with a health and retirement package for be sit in this chamber laughter for everyone else especially folk in 40 and 50 save for retirement or bounce back from job loss have get a lot tough americans understand that at some point in career in this new economy may have to retool and may have to retrain but should not lose what have already work so hard to build in the process that ’s why social|security and medicare be more important than ever should not weaken should strengthen them.(applause and for americans short of retirement basic benefit should be just as mobile as everything else be today.&nbsp;that by the way be what the|affordable|care|act be all about.&nbsp;it ’s about fill the gap in employer base care so that when lose a job or go back to school or strike out and launch that new business will still have coverage people have gain coverage so far applause and in the process health care inflation have slow and business have create job every|single|month since become law now be guess will not agree on health care anytime soon applause a little applause right there laughter just a guess but there should be other way party can work together to improve economic security say a hardworking american lose job should not just make sure that can get unemployment insurance should make sure that program encourage to retrain for a business that ’s ready to hire if that new job do not pay as much there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that can still pay bill and even if ’s go from job to job should still be able to save for retirement and take saving with that ’s the way make the new economy work better for everybody also know speaker ryan have talk about interest in tackle poverty america be about give everybody willing to work a chance a hand up.&nbsp;and would welcome a serious discussion about strategy can all support like expand tax cut for low income worker who do not have children.&nbsp;(applause but there be some area where just have to be honest have be difficult to find agreement over and a lot of fall under the category of what role the government should play in make sure the system ’s not rig in favor of the wealthy and big corporation applause and be an honest disagreement and the american people have a choice to make believe a thriving private sector be the lifeblood of economy think there be outdate regulation that need to be change there be red tape that need to be cut applause there go yes applause but after year now of record corporate profit work family will not get more opportunity or big paycheck just by let big bank or big oil or hedge fund make own rule at everybody else ’s expense applause middle class family be not go to feel more secure because allow attack on collective bargaining to go unanswered food stamp recipient do not cause the financial crisis recklessness on wall street do applause immigrant be not the principal reason wage have not go up those decision be make in the boardroom that all too often put quarterly earning over long term return ’ sure not the average family watch tonight that avoid pay taxis

in this this|year plan to lift up the many business who have figure out that do right by worker or customer or community end up be good for shareholder applause and want to spread those good practice across america that be part of a bright future applause in fact turn out many of good corporate citizen be also most creative and this bring to the second big question as a country have to answer how do reignite that spirit of innovation to meet big challenge year ago when the russians beat into space do not deny sputnik be up there laughter do not argue about the science or shrink research and development budget.&nbsp;we build a space program almost overnight and be walk on the moon.&nbsp;(applause now that spirit of discovery be in dna america be thomas|edison and the wright

the family that can still save let make america the country that cure cancer once and for all.(applause medical research be critical need the same level of commitment when come to develop clean energy source applause.)look if anybody still want to dispute the science around climate change have at will be pretty lonely because will be debate military most of america ’s business leader the majority of the american people almost the entire scientific community and nation around the world who agree ’s a problem and intend to solve but even if even if the planet be not at stake even if be not the|warmest|year on record until turn out to be even hot why would want to pass up the chance for american business to produce and sell the energy of the future applause listen make the single big investment in clean energy in history here be the result in field from iowa to texas wind power be now cheap than dirty conventional power on rooftop from arizona to new|york solar be save americans

something by the way that environmentalist and tea|partier have team up to support and meanwhile have cut import of foreign oil by and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on earth applause gas under buck a gallon be not bad either.&nbsp;(applause now have get to accelerate the transition away from old dirty energy source rather than subsidize the past should invest in the future especially in community that rely on fossil fuel do no favor when do not show where the trend be go that ’s why be go to push to change the way manage oil and coal resource so that better reflect the cost impose on taxpayer and planet and that way put money back into those community and put tens|of|thousand of americans to work building transportation system applause now none of this be go to happen overnight and yes there be plenty of entrenched interest who want to protect the status quo but the job will create the money will save the planet will preserve that be the kind of future kid and grandkid deserve and be within grasp climate change be just of many issue where security be link to the rest of the world.&nbsp;and that ’s why the third big question that have to answer together be how to keep america safe and strong without either isolate or try to nation build everywhere there ’s a problem tell earlier all the talk of america ’s economic decline be political

fortunately there be a smart approach a patient and disciplined strategy that use every element of national power say america will always act alone if necessary to protect people and ally but on issue of global concern will mobilize the world to work with and make sure other country pull own weight that ’s approach to conflict like syria where be partner with local force and lead international

matter of political correctness this be a matter of understanding just what be that make strong the world respect not just for arsenal respect for diversity and openness and the way respect every faith holiness pope|francis tell this body from the very spot that be stand on tonight imitate the hatred and violence of tyrant and murderer be the good way to take place.”&nbsp;when politician insult muslims whether abroad or fellow citizen when a mosque be vandalize or a kid be call name that do not make safe that ’s not tell like be ’s just wrong applause.)&nbsp;it diminish in the eye of

opportunity and security for family a rise standard of living a sustainable peaceful planet for kid all that be within reach but will only happen if work together will only happen if can have rational constructive debate will only happen if fix politic a well politic do not mean have to agree on everything this be a big country different region different attitude different interest that ’s of strength too founder distribute power between state and branch of government and expect to argue just as do fiercely over the size and shape of government over commerce and foreign relation over the meaning of liberty and the imperative of security but democracy do require basic bond of trust between citizen do not work if think the people who disagree with be all motivate by malice do not work if think that political opponent be unpatriotic or try to weaken america democracy grind to a halt without a willingness to compromise or when even basic fact be contest or when listen only to those who agree with public life wither when only the most extreme voice get all the attention and most of all democracy break down when the average person feel voice do not matter that the system be rig in favor of the rich or the powerful or some special interest too many americans feel that way right now ’ of the few regret of presidency that the rancor and suspicion between the party have get bad instead of well have no doubt a president with the gift of lincoln or roosevelt may have better bridge the divide and guarantee will keep try to be well so long as hold this office but fellow americans this can not be task or any president ’s alone there be a whole lot of folk in this chamber good people who would like to see more cooperation would like to see a more elevated debate in washington but feel trap by the imperative of get elect by the noise come out of base know have tell be the worst keep secret in washington and a lot of be not enjoy be trap in that kind of rancor but that mean if want a well politic and be address the american people now want a well politic ’s not enough just to change a congressman or change a senator or even change a president have to change the system to reflect well selves.&nbsp;i think have get to end the practice of draw congressional district so that politician can pick voter and not the other way around applause let a bipartisan group do applause have to reduce the influence of money in politic so that a handful of family or hide interest can not bankroll election applause and if exist approach to campaign finance reform can not pass muster in the court need to work together to find a real solution because be a problem and most of do not like raise money know have do applause.)&nbsp;we’ve get to make easy to vote not hard applause need to modernize for the way live now.&nbsp;(applause this be america want to make easy for people to&nbsp;participate and over the course of this year,&nbsp;i intend to travel the country to push for reform that do just that but can not do these thing on own applause change in political process in not just who get elect but how get elect that will only happen when the american people demand depend on that ’s what ’s mean by a government of by and for the people what be suggest be hard ’ a lot easy to be cynical to accept that change be not possible and politic be hopeless and the problem be all the folk who be elect do not care and to believe that voice and action do not matter but if give up now then forsake a well future those with money and power will gain great control over the decision that could send a young soldier to war or allow another economic disaster or roll back the equal right and voting right that generation of americans have fight even die to secure and then as frustration grow there will be voice urge to fall back into respective tribe to scapegoat fellow citizen who do not look like or pray like or vote like do or share the same background can not afford to go down that path will not deliver the economy want will not produce the security want but most of all contradict everything that make the envy of the world so fellow americans whatever may believe whether prefer party or no party whether support agenda or fight as hard as could against collective future depend on willingness to uphold duty as a citizen to vote to speak out to stand up for other especially the weak especially the vulnerable know that each of be only here because somebody somewhere stand up for applause need every american to stay active in public life and not just

thousands|of|dollar back into pocket each applause & nbsp here ’s example.&nbsp during world|war|ii when man like grandfather go off to war have woman like grandmother in the workforce be a national security priority so this country provide universal childcare.&nbsp in today ’s economy when have both parent in the workforce be an economic necessity for many family need affordable high quality childcare more|than|ever.&nbsp applause & nbsp ’s not a nice to have ’ a must have.&nbsp so ’s time stop treat childcare as a side issue or as a woman ’s issue and treat like the national economic

in america by create more slot and a new tax cut of up|to|$3,000 per child per applause & nbsp here ’s another example.&nbsp today be the only advanced country on earth that do not guarantee pay sick leave or pay maternity leave to workers.&nbsp three|million worker have no pay sick leave million.&nbsp think about that.&nbsp and that force too many parent to make the gut wrench choice between a

work.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp ’s laughter.)&nbsp ’s time.&nbsp still need to make sure employee get the overtime have earned.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp and to everyone in this congress who still refuse to raise the minimum wage say this:&nbsp if truly believe could work full time and support a family on a year try not vote to give million of the hardest work people in america a raise.&nbsp applause & nbsp now these idea will not make everybody rich will not relieve every hardship.&nbsp that ’s not the job of government.&nbsp to give work family a fair shot still need more employer to see beyond next|quarter ’s earning and recognize that invest in workforce be in company ’s long term interest.&nbsp still need law that strengthen rather than weaken union and give american worker a voice.&nbsp applause & nbsp but know thing like childcare and sick leave and equal pay thing like low mortgage premium and a high minimum wage these idea will make a meaningful difference in the life of million of families.&nbsp that ’s a fact.&nbsp and that ’s what all of republicans and democrats alike be send here to do to make sure folk keep earn high wage down the road have to do more to help americans

and universal in america as high school be today.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp let stay ahead of the curve.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;and want to work with this congress to make sure those already burden with student loan can reduce monthly payment so that student debt do not derail anyone’s|dreams.&nbsp;(applause.)&nbsp & nbsp thank to vice president biden ’s great work to update job training

have give a tremendous advantage over other nation ’s keep youthful dynamic and entrepreneurial have shape character as a people with limitless possibility –- people not trap by past but able to remake as choose but today immigration system be break and everybody know family who enter country the right way and play by the rule watch other flout the rule business owner who offer worker good wage and benefit see the competition exploit undocumented immigrant by pay far less all of take offense to anyone who reap the reward of live in america without take on the responsibility of live in america and undocumented immigrant who desperately want to embrace those responsibility see little option but to remain in the shadow or risk family be tear apart ’s be this way for decade and for decade have not do much about when take office commit to fix this broken immigration system and begin by do what could to secure border today have more agent and technology deploy to secure southern border than at any time in history and over the|past|six|year illegal border crossing have be cut by more|than|half although this|summer there be a brief spike in unaccompanied child be apprehend at border the number of such child be now actually low than ’s be in nearly|two|years overall the number of people try to cross border illegally be at low level since the|1970s those be the fact meanwhile work with congress on a comprehensive fix and last|year democrats republicans and independent come together to pass a bipartisan bill in the senate be not perfect be a compromise but reflect common sense would have double the number of border patrol agent while give undocumented immigrant a pathway to citizenship if pay a fine start pay taxis and go to the back of the line and independent expert say that would help grow economy and shrink deficit have the|house|of|representative allow that kind of bill a simple yes or no vote would have pass with support from both party and today would be the law but for now republican leader in the house have refuse to allow that simple vote now continue to believe that the good way to solve this problem be by work together to pass that kind of common sense law but until that happen there be action have the legal authority to take as president –- the same kind of action take by democratic and republican president before that will help make immigration system more fair and more just tonight be announce those action first will build on progress at the border with additional resource for law enforcement personnel so that can stem the flow of illegal crossing and speed the return of those who do cross over will make easy and faster for high skilled immigrant graduate and entrepreneur to stay and contribute to economy as so many business leader have propose third will take step to deal responsibly with the million of undocumented immigrant who already live in country want to say more about this third issue because generate the most passion and controversy even as be a nation of immigrant be also a nation of law undocumented worker break immigration law and believe that must be hold accountable especially those who may be dangerous that ’s why over the|past|six|year deportation of criminal be up and that ’s why be go to keep focus enforcement resource on actual threat to security felon not family criminal not child gang member not a mom who ’s work hard to provide for kid will prioritize just like law enforcement do every|day but even as focus on deport criminal the fact be million of immigrant in every state of every race and nationality still live here illegally and let be honest -– track down round up and deport million of people be not realistic anyone who suggest otherwise be not be straight with ’s also not who be as americans after all most of these immigrant have be here a long time work hard often in tough low pay job support family worship at church many of kid be american bear or spend most of life here and hope dream and patriotism be just like ours as predecessor president bush once put be a part of american life now here ’s the thing expect people who live in this country to play by the rule expect that those who cut the line will not be unfairly reward so be go to offer the follow deal if have be in america for more|than|five|year if have child who be american citizen or legal resident if register pass a criminal background check and be willing to pay fair share of taxis will be able to apply to stay in this country temporarily without fear of deportation can come out of the shadow and get right with the law that ’s what this deal be now let be clear about what be not this deal do not apply to anyone who have come to this country recently do not apply to anyone who may come to america illegally in the future do not grant citizenship or the right to stay here permanently or offer the same benefit that citizen receive only congress can do that all be say be be not go to deport know some of the critic of this action call amnesty well ’s not amnesty be the immigration system have today million of people who live here without pay taxis or play by the rule while politician use the issue to scare people and whip up vote at election time that ’s the real amnesty –- leave this broken system the way be mass amnesty would be unfair mass deportation would be both impossible and contrary to character what be describing be accountability –- a common sense middle ground approach if meet the criterion can come out of the shadow and get right with the law if be a criminal will be deport if plan to enter the u.s. illegally chance of get catch and send back just go up the action be take be not only lawful be the kind of action take by every single republican president and every single democratic president for the|past|half|century and to those member of congress who question authority to make immigration system work better or question the wisdom of act where congress have fail have answer pass a bill want to work with both party to pass a more permanent legislative solution and the|day sign that bill into law the action take will no longer be necessary meanwhile do not let a disagreement over a single issue be a dealbreaker on every issue that ’s not how democracy work and congress certainly should not shut down government again just because disagree on this americans be tired of gridlock what country need from right now be a common purpose –- a high purpose most americans support the type of reform have talk about tonight but understand the disagreement hold by many of at home million of include go back generation in this country with ancestor who put in the painstaking work to become citizen so do not like the notion that anyone may get a free pass to american citizenship know some worry immigration will change the very fabric of who be or take job or stick to middle class family at a time when already feel like have get the raw deal for hear these concern but that ’s not what these step would do history and the fact show that immigrant be a net plus for economy and society and believe ’ important that all of have this debate without impugn each other ’s character because for all the back and forth of washington have to remember that this debate be about something big ’ about who be as a country and who want to be for future generation be a nation that tolerate the hypocrisy of a system where worker who pick fruit and make bed never have a chance to get right with the law or be a nation that give a chance to make amend take responsibility and give kid a well future be a nation that accept the cruelty of rip child from parent ’ arm or be a nation that value family and work together to keep together be a nation that educate the world ’s good and bright in university only to send home to create business in country that compete against or be a nation that encourage to stay and create job here create business here create industry right here in america that ’s what this debate be all about need more than politic as usual when come to immigration need reason thoughtful compassionate debate that focus on hope not fear know the politic of this issue be tough but let tell why have come to feel so strongly about over the|past|few|year have see the determination of immigrant father who work or job without take a dime from the government and at risk any moment of lose all just to build a well life for kid have see the heartbreak and anxiety of child whose mother may be take away from just because do not have the right paper have see the courage of student who except for the circumstance of birth be as american as malia or sasha student who bravely come out as undocumented in hope could make a difference in the country love these people –- neighbor classmate friend –- do not come here in search of a free ride or an easy life come to work and study and serve in military and above all contribute to america ’s success tomorrow will travel to las|vegas and meet with some of these student include a young woman name astrid|silva astrid be bring to america when be only possession be a cross doll and the frilly dress have on when start school do not speak any english catch up to other kid by read newspaper and watch pbs and become a good student father work in landscaping mom clean other people ’s home would not let astrid apply to a technology magnet school not because do not love but because be afraid the paperwork would out as an undocumented immigrant –- so apply behind back and get in still mostly live in the shadow –- until grandmother who visit every year from mexico pass away and could not travel to the funeral without risk of be find out and deport be around that time decide to begin advocate for and other like and today astrid|silva be a college student work on third degree be a nation that kick out a striving hopeful immigrant like astrid or be a nation that find a way to welcome in scripture tell that shall not oppress a stranger for know the heart of a stranger –- be stranger once too fellow americans be and always will be a nation of immigrant be stranger once too and whether forebear be stranger who cross the atlantic or the pacific or be here only because this country welcome in and teach that to be an american be about something more than what look like or what last name be or how worship what make americans be share commitment to an ideal that all of be create equal and all of have the chance to make of life what will that ’s the country parent and grandparent and generation before build for that ’s the tradition must uphold that ’s the legacy must leave for those who be yet to come thank god bless and god bless this country

business that create job here at home moreover can take the money save with this transition to tax reform to create job rebuild road upgrade port unclog commute because in today ’s global economy first class job gravitate to first class infrastructure.&nbsp will need congress to protect more|than|three|million job by finish transportation and waterway bill this summer.&nbsp but will act on own to slash bureaucracy and streamline the permitting process for key project so can get more construction worker on the job as fast as possible also have the chance right now to beat other country in

reform bill that allow business to stay focused on innovation not costly needless litigation now of the big factor in bring more job back be commitment to american energy.&nbsp the all of the above energy strategy announce a|few|years|ago be work and today america be close to energy independence than have be in decade of the reason why be natural gas if extract safely ’s the bridge fuel that can power economy with less of the carbon pollution that cause climate change.&nbsp business plan to invest almost|$100|billion in new factory that use natural gas.&nbsp will cut red tape to help state

that do and even as have increase energy production have partner with business builder and local community to reduce the energy consume.&nbsp when rescue automaker for example work with to set high fuel efficiency standard for cars.&nbsp;&nbsp;in the|coming|months will build on that success by set new standard for truck so can keep drive down oil import and what pay at the pump take together energy policy be create job and lead to a clean safe planet & nbsp;over the|past|eight|years the|united|state have reduce total carbon pollution more than any other nation on earth.&nbsp but have to act with more urgency because a change climate be already harm western community struggle with drought and coastal city deal with floods.&nbsp;that ’s why direct administration to work with state utility and other to set new standard on the amount of carbon pollution power plant be allow to dump into the air.&nbsp;&nbsp;the shift to a clean energy economy will not happen overnight and will require tough choice along the way.&nbsp but the debate be settled.&nbsp climate change be a fact.&nbsp and when child ’s child look in the eye and ask if do all could to leave a safe more stable world with new source of energy want to be able to sayye do finally if be serious about economic growth be time to heed the call of business leader labor leader faith leader and law enforcement and fix broken immigration system.&nbsp republicans and democrats in the senate have acted.&nbsp know that member of both party in the house want to do the same.&nbsp independent economist say immigration reform will grow economy and shrink deficit by almost|$1|trillion in the|next|two decades.&nbsp and for good reason when people come here to fulfill dream to study invent and contribute to culture make country a more attractive place for business to locate and create job for so let get immigration reform do this|year the idea have outline so far can speed up growth and create more jobs.&nbsp but in this rapidly change economy have to make sure that every american have the skill to fill those job the good news be know how to do it.&nbsp two|years|ago as the auto industry come roar back andra|rush open up a manufacturing firm in detroit.&nbsp know that ford need part for the best sell truck in america and know how to make them.&nbsp just need the workforce.&nbsp so dial up what call

needs.&nbsp and if congress want to help can concentrate funding on prove program that connect more ready to work americans with ready to be fill job be also convince can help americans return to the workforce faster by reform unemployment insurance so that ’s more effective in today ’s economy.&nbsp but first this congress need to restore the unemployment insurance just let expire for people let

will find a job … will pay taxis and will raise child in own home in the community love.&nbsp please give this chance congress give these hardworking responsible americans that need help but more important this country need in the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;that ’s why have be ask ceo to give more long term unemployed worker a fair shot at that new job and new chance to support family this|week many will come to the|white|house to make that commitment real.&nbsp;&nbsp;tonight ask every business leader in america to join and to do the same because be strong when america field a full team.&nbsp of

solve critical thinking science technology engineering and math.&nbsp some of this change be hard.&nbsp require everything from more challenging curriculum and more demand parent to well support for teacher and new way to measure how well kid think not how well can fill in a bubble on a test.&nbsp but ’s worth and ’s working.&nbsp the problem be be still not reach enough kid and be not reach in time.&nbsp that have to change.&nbsp research show that of the good investment can make in a child ’s life be high quality early|education.&nbsp last|year ask this congress to help state make high quality pre - k available to every year old.&nbsp as a parent as well as a president repeat that request tonight.&nbsp;but in the meantime state have raise pre - k funding on own.&nbsp know can not wait.&nbsp so just as work with state to reform school this|year will invest in new partnership with state and community across the country in a race to the top for young children.&nbsp and as congress decide what ’s go to do be go to pull together a coalition of elect official business leader and philanthropist willing to help more kid access the high quality pre - k need last|year also pledge to connect of student to high speed broadband over the|next|four years.&nbsp;&nbsp;tonight can announce that with the support of the fcc and company like apple microsoft sprint and verizon have get a down payment to start connect school and twenty|million student over the|next|two|year without add a dime to the deficit.&nbsp be work to redesign high school and partner with college and employer that offer the real world education and hand on training that can lead directly to a job and career.&nbsp;&nbsp;we’re shake up system of high education to give parent more information and college more incentive to offer well value so that no middle class kid be price out of a college education.&nbsp be offer million the opportunity to cap monthly student loan payment to ten|percent of income and want to work with congress to see how can help even more americans who feel trap by student loan debt.&nbsp and be reach out to some of america ’s lead foundation and corporation on&nbsp;a new initiativeto help more young man of color face tough odd stay on track and reach full potential the bottom line be michelle and want every child to have the same chance this country give us.&nbsp but know opportunity agenda will not be complete and too many young people enter the workforce today will see the|american|dream as an empty promise unless do more to make sure economy honor the dignity of work and hard work pay off for every single american.&nbsp today woman make up about|half workforce.&nbsp but still make for every dollar a man earns.&nbsp that be wrong and in ’s an embarrassment a woman deserve equal pay for equal work.&nbsp deserve to have a baby without sacrifice job.&nbsp a mother deserve a day off to care for a sick child or sick parent without run into hardship and know what a father do ’s time to do away with workplace policy that belong in a “ mad men episode.&nbsp;&nbsp;this year let all come together congress the|white|house and business from wall street to main street to give every woman the opportunity deserves.&nbsp because firmly believe when woman succeed america succeed now woman hold a majority of low wage job but be not the only one stifle by stagnant wages.&nbsp americans understand that some people will earn more than other and do not resent those who by virtue of effort achieve incredible success.&nbsp but americans overwhelmingly agree that no one who work full time should ever have to raise a family in poverty in the|year since ask this congress to raise the minimum wage state have pass law to raise theirs.&nbsp many business have do on own.&nbsp nick|chute be here tonight with boss john|soranno.&nbsp john ’s an owner of in minneapolis and nick help make the dough.&nbsp only now make more of john just give employee a raise to a decision that ease financial stress and boost morale tonight ask more of america ’s business leader to follow john ’s lead and do what can to raise employee wages.&nbsp;&nbsp;to every mayor governor and state legislator in america say do not have to wait for congress to act americans will support if take this on.&nbsp and as a chief executive intend to lead by example profitable corporation like costco see high wage as the smart way to boost productivity and reduce turnover should too.&nbsp in the|coming|weeks will issue an executive|order require federal contractor to pay federally fund employee a fair wage of at|least|$10.10 an hour because if cook troop ’ meal or wash dish should not have to live in poverty of course to reach million more congress need to get on board today the federal minimum wage be worth about|twenty|percent less than be when ronald|reagan first stand here.&nbsp tom|harkin and george|miller have a bill to fix that by lift the minimum wage to this will help families.&nbsp will give business customer with more money to spend.&nbsp do not involve any new bureaucratic program.&nbsp so join the rest of the country.&nbsp say yes.&nbsp give|america a raise there be other step can take to help family make end meet and few be more effective at reduce inequality and help family pull up through hard work than the|earned|income|tax|credit.&nbsp right now help about|half of all parent at some point.&nbsp but agree with republicans like senator rubio that do not do enough for single worker who do not have kids.&nbsp so let work together to strengthen the credit reward work and help more americans get ahead let do more to help americans save for retirement today most worker do not have a pension.&nbsp a social|security check often be not enough on own.&nbsp and while the stock market have double over that do not help folk who do not have that ’s why tomorrow will direct the treasury to create a new way for work americans to start own retirement saving myra ’ a new saving bond that encourage folk to build a nest egg.&nbsp myra guarantee a decent return with no risk of lose what put and if this congress want to help work with to fix an upside down tax code that give big tax break to help the wealthy save but do little to nothing for middle class americans.&nbsp offer every american access to an automatic ira on the job so can save at work just like everyone in this chamber can.&nbsp and since the most important investment many family make be home send legislation that protect taxpayer from foot the bill for a housing crisis ever again and keep the dream of homeownership alive for future generation of americans last point on financial security.&nbsp for decade few thing expose hard work family to economic hardship more than a broken health care system.&nbsp and in case have not hear be in the process of fix that a pre - exist condition use to mean that someone like

already help million of americans like amanda.&nbsp the first forty be plenty.&nbsp get it.&nbsp all owe to the american people to say what be for not just what be against.&nbsp and if want to know the real impact this law be have just talk to governor steve|beshear of kentucky who ’s here tonight.&nbsp kentucky ’s not the most liberal part of the country but ’s like a man possess when come to cover commonwealth ’s families.&nbsp be friend and neighbor said.&nbsp be people shop and go to church with … farmer out on the tractor grocery clerk be people who go to work every|morning pray do not

to sign up.&nbsp kid call mom and walk through the application.&nbsp will give some peace of mind plus will appreciate hear from you.&nbsp after all that ’s the spirit that have always move this nation forward.&nbsp ’ the spirit of citizenship the recognition that through hard work and responsibility can pursue individual dream but still come together as american family to make sure the next generation can pursue dream as well citizenship mean stand up for everyone ’s right to vote.&nbsp last|year part of the|voting|rights|act be weakened.&nbsp but conservative republicans and liberal democrats be work together to strengthen and the bipartisan commission appoint last|year have offer reform so that no one have to wait more than a half hour to vote.&nbsp let support these efforts.&nbsp should be the power of vote not the size of bank account that drive democracy citizenship mean stand up for the life that gun violence steal from each day.&nbsp have see the courage of parent student pastor and police officer all over this country who say “ be not afraid and intend to keep try with or without congress to help stop more tragedy from visit innocent americans in movie theater shopping mall or school like sandy|hook citizenship demand a sense of common cause participation in the hard work of self government an obligation to serve to communities.&nbsp and know this chamber agree that few americans give more to country than diplomat and the man and woman of the|united|states|armed|force tonight because of the extraordinary troop and civilian who risk and lie down life to keep free the|united|states be more secure.&nbsp when take office nearly|180,000 americans be serve in iraq and afghanistan.&nbsp today all troop be out of iraq.&nbsp more|than|60,000 of troop have already come home from afghanistan.&nbsp with afghan force now in the lead for own security troop have move to a support role.&nbsp;together with ally will complete mission there by and america ’s long war will finally be over after will support a unified afghanistan as take responsibility for own future.&nbsp if the afghan government sign a security agreement that have negotiate a small force of americans could remain in afghanistan with nato ally to carry out narrow mission training and assist afghan force and counterterrorism operation to pursue any remnant of al|qaeda.&nbsp for while relationship with afghanistan will change thing will not resolve that terrorist do not launch attack against country the fact be that danger remains.&nbsp;&nbsp;while have put al|qaeda ’s core leadership on a path to defeat the threat have evolve as affiliate and other extremist take root in different part of the world.&nbsp;in yemen somalia iraq and mali have to keep work with partner to disrupt and disable these networks.&nbsp;in syria will support the opposition that the agenda of terrorist at home will keep strengthen defense and combat new threat like cyberattacks.&nbsp and as reform defense budget have to keep faith with man and woman in uniform and invest in the capability need to succeed in future mission have to remain vigilant.&nbsp;&nbsp;but strongly believe leadership and security can not depend on military alone.&nbsp;as commander in chief have use force when need to protect the american people and will never hesitate to do so as long as hold this office.&nbsp but will not send troop into harm ’s way unless ’s truly necessary nor will allow son and daughter to be mire in open ended conflicts.&nbsp must fight the battle that need to be fight not those that terrorist prefer from large scale deployment that drain strength and may ultimately feed extremism so even as aggressively pursue terrorist network through more targeted effort and by build the capacity of foreign partner america must move off a permanent war footing.&nbsp that ’s why have impose prudent limit on the use of drone for will not be safe if people abroad believe strike within country without regard for the consequence.&nbsp that ’s why work with this congress will reform surveillance program because the vital work of intelligence community depend on public confidence here and abroad that the privacy of ordinary people be not be violated.&nbsp and with the afghan war ending,&nbsp;this need to be the year congress lift the remain restriction on detainee transfer and close the prison at guantanamo|bay because counter terrorism not just through intelligence and military action but by remain true to constitutional ideal and set an example for the rest of the world see in a world of complex threat security and leadership depend on all element of power include strong and principle diplomacy.&nbsp american diplomacy have rally more|than|fifty country to prevent nuclear material from fall into the wrong hand and allow to reduce own reliance on cold|war american diplomacy back by the threat of force be why syria ’s chemical weapon be be eliminate and will continue to work with the international community to usher in the future the syrian people deserve a future free of dictatorship terror and fear as speak american diplomacy be support israelis and palestinians as engage in difficult but necessary talk to end the conflict there to achieve dignity and an independent state for palestinians and last peace and security for the state of israel a jewish state that know america will always be at side and be american diplomacy back by pressure that have halt the progress of iran ’s nuclear program and roll part of that program back for the very first time in a decade.&nbsp;&nbsp;as gather here tonight iran have begin to eliminate stockpile of high level of enriched uranium.&nbsp be not instal advanced centrifuges.&nbsp unprecedented inspection help the world verify every|day that iran be not build a bomb.&nbsp and with ally and partner be engage in negotiation to see if can peacefully achieve a goal all share prevent iran from obtain a nuclear weapon these negotiation will be difficult.&nbsp may not succeed.&nbsp be clear eyed about iran ’s support for terrorist organization like hezbollah which threaten ally and the mistrust between nation can not be wish away.&nbsp but these negotiation do not rely on trust any long term deal agree to must be base on verifiable action that convince and the international community that iran be not build a nuclear bomb.&nbsp if john|f.|kennedy and ronald|reagan could negotiate with the|soviet|union then surely a strong and confident america can negotiate with less powerful adversary today the sanction that put in place help make this opportunity possible.&nbsp but let be clear if this congress send a new sanction bill now that threaten to derail these talk will veto it.&nbsp for the sake of national security must give diplomacy a chance to succeed.&nbsp if iran ’s leader do not seize this opportunity then will be the first to call for more sanction and stand ready to exercise all option to make sure iran do not build a nuclear if iran ’s leader do seize the chance then iran could take an important step to rejoin the community of nation and will have resolve of the lead security challenge of time without the risk of war finally let remember that leadership be define not just by defense against threat but by the enormous opportunity to do good and promote understanding around the globe to forge great cooperation to expand new market to free people from fear and want.&nbsp and no one be better position to take advantage of those opportunity than

the|united|states|of|america view transcript transcript thank & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;thank everybody & nbsp;thank so much & nbsp;please please have a seat & nbsp;thank so much & nbsp;well thank neera for the wonderful introduction and share a story that resonate with & nbsp;there be a lot of parallel in life and probably resonate with some of & nbsp & nbsp over the|past|10|year the|center|for|american|progress have do incredible work to shape the debate over expand opportunity for all americans & nbsp;and could not be more grateful to cap not only for give a lot of good policy idea but also give a lot of staff & nbsp;(laughter & nbsp;my friend john|podesta run transition chief of staff denis|mcdonough do a stint at cap & nbsp;so guy be obviously do a good job training folk & nbsp also want to thank all the member of congress and administration who be here today for the wonderful work that do & nbsp;i want to thank mayor gray and everyone here at thearc for have & nbsp;this center which have be to quite a bit have have a chance to see some of the great work that ’s do here & nbsp;and all the nonprofit that call thearc home offer access to everything from education to health care to a safe shelter from the street which mean that be harness the power of community to expand opportunity for folk here in d.c.|&nbsp;and work reflect a tradition that run through history a belief that be greater together than be on own & nbsp;and that ’s what have come here to talk about today & nbsp & nbsp over the|last|two|month washington have be dominate by some pretty contentious debate think that ’s fair to say & nbsp;and between a reckless shutdown by congressional republicans in an effort to repeal the|affordable|care|act and admittedly poor execution on administration ’s part in implement the late stage of the new law nobody have acquit very well these|past|few|month & nbsp;so ’s not surprising that the american people ’s frustration with washington be at an all time high & nbsp & nbsp but know that people ’s frustration run deep than these most recent political battle & nbsp;their frustration be root in own daily battle to make end meet to pay for college buy a home save for retirement & nbsp;it ’s root in the nagging sense that no matter how hard work the deck be stack against & nbsp;and ’s root in the fear that kid will not be well off than be & nbsp;they may not follow the constant back and forth in washington or all the policy detail but experience in a very personal way the relentless decade long trend that want to spend some time talk about today & nbsp;and that be a dangerous and grow inequality and lack of upward mobility that have jeopardize middle class america ’s basic bargain that if work hard have a chance to get ahead & nbsp believe this be the defining challenge of time & nbsp;make sure economy work for every work american & nbsp;it ’s why run for president & nbsp;it be at the|center|of|last|year ’s campaign & nbsp;it drive everything do in this office & nbsp;and know have raise this issue before and some will ask why raise the issue again right now & nbsp;i do because the outcome of the debate be have right now whether ’s health care or the budget or reform housing and financial system all these thing will have real practical implication for every american & nbsp;and be convince that the decision make on these issue over the|next|few|year will determine whether or not child will grow up in an america where opportunity be real & nbsp now the premise that be all create equal be the opening line in the american story & nbsp;and while do not promise equal outcome have strive to deliver equal opportunity the idea that success do not depend on be bear into wealth or privilege depend on effort and merit & nbsp;and with every chapter have add to that story have work hard to put those word into practice & nbsp;&nbsp & nbsp be abraham|lincoln a self describe “ poor man ’s son who start a system of land grant college all over this country so that any poor man ’s son could go learn something new & nbsp & nbsp when farm give way to factory a rich man ’s son name teddy|roosevelt fight for an hour workday protection for worker and busted monopoly that keep price high and wage low & nbsp & nbsp when million live in poverty fdr fight for social|security and insurance for the unemployed and a minimum wage & nbsp & nbsp when million die without health insurance lbj fight for medicare and medicaid & nbsp & nbsp together forge a new deal declare a|war|on|poverty in a great society & nbsp;we build a ladder of opportunity to climb and stretch out a safety net beneath so that if fall would not be too far and could bounce back & nbsp;and as a result america build the large middle class the world have ever know & nbsp;and for after world|war|ii be the engine of prosperity & nbsp & nbsp now can not look at the past through rose color glass & nbsp;the economy do not always work for everyone & nbsp;racial discrimination lock million out of poverty or out of opportunity & nbsp;women be too often confine to a handful of often poorly pay profession & nbsp;and be only through painstaking struggle that more woman and minority and americans with disability begin to win the right to more fairly and fully participate in the economy & nbsp & nbsp nevertheless during the post - world|war|ii year the economic ground feel stable and secure for most americans and the future look bright than the past & nbsp;and for some that mean follow in old man ’s footstep at the local plant and know that a blue collar job would let buy a home and a car maybe a vacation once in a while health care a reliable pension & nbsp;for other mean go to college in some case maybe the first in family to go to college & nbsp;and mean graduate without take on load of debt and be able to count on advancement through a vibrant job market & nbsp & nbsp now ’s true that those at the top even in those|years claim a much large share of income than the rest & nbsp;the top consistently take home about|one third of national income & nbsp;but that kind of inequality take place in a dynamic market economy where everyone ’s wage and income be grow & nbsp;and because of upward mobility the guy on the factory floor could picture kid run the company some|day & nbsp but start in the|late|‘70s this social compact begin to unravel & nbsp;technology make easy for company to do more with less eliminate certain job occupation & nbsp;a more competitive world let company ship job anywhere & nbsp;and as good manufacturing job automate or head offshore worker lose leverage job pay less and offer few benefit & nbsp & nbsp as value of community break down and competitive pressure increase business lobby washington to weaken union and the value of the minimum wage & nbsp;a a trickle down ideology become more prominent taxis be slash for the wealthy while investment in thing that make all rich like school and infrastructure be allow to wither & nbsp;and for a certain period of time could ignore this weaken economic foundation in part because more family be rely on earner as woman enter the workforce & nbsp;we take on more debt finance by a juice up housing market & nbsp;but when the music stop and the crisis hit million of family be strip of whatever cushion have & nbsp and the result be an economy that ’s become profoundly unequal and family that be more insecure & nbsp;i’ll just give a few statistic & nbsp;since when graduate from high school productivity be up by more|than|90|percent but the income of the typical family have increase by less|than|eight|percent & nbsp;since economy have more than double in size but most of that growth have flow to a fortunate few & nbsp & nbsp the top no longer take in third of income now take half & nbsp;whereas in the past the average ceo make about|20|to|30 time the income of the average worker today ’s ceo now make time more & nbsp;and meanwhile a family in the top have a net worth time high than the typical family which be a record for this country & nbsp so the basic bargain at the heart of economy have fray & fact this trend towards grow inequality be not unique to america ’s market economy & nbsp;across the developed world inequality have increase & nbsp;some of may have see just last|week the pope speak about this at eloquent length & nbsp;“how can be write that be not a news item when an elderly homeless person die of exposure but be news when the stock market lose point & nbsp but this increase inequality be most pronounce in country and challenge the very essence of who be as a people & nbsp;understand have never begrudge success in america & nbsp;we aspire to & admire folk who start new business create job and invent the product that enrich life & nbsp;and expect to be reward handsomely for & fact have often accept more income inequality than many other nation for big reason because be convince that america be a place where even if be bear with nothing with a little hard work can improve own situation over time and build something well to leave kid & nbsp;as lincoln once say while do not propose any war upon capital do wish to allow the humble man an equal chance to get rich with everybody else & nbsp the problem be that alongside increase inequality have see diminished level of upward mobility in recent|years & nbsp;a child bear in the top have about a chance of stay at or near the top & nbsp;a child bear into the|bottom|20|percent have a less|than|1-in-20 shot at make to the top & nbsp;he ’s time likeli to stay where be & fact statistic show not only that level of income inequality rank near country like jamaica and argentina but that be hard today for a child bear here in america to improve station in life than be for child in most of wealthy ally country like canada or germany or france & nbsp;they have great mobility than do not less & nbsp & nbsp the idea that so many child be bear into poverty in the wealthy nation on earth be heartbreake enough & nbsp;but the idea that a child may never be able to escape that poverty because lack a decent education or health care or a community that view future as own that should offend all of and should compel to action & nbsp;we be a well country than this & nbsp & nbsp so let repeat & nbsp;the combined trend of increase inequality and decrease mobility pose a fundamental threat to the american dream way of life and what stand for around the globe & nbsp;and be not simply a moral claim that be make here & nbsp;there be practical consequence to rise inequality and reduce mobility & nbsp & nbsp for thing these trend be bad for economy & nbsp;one study find that growth be more fragile and recession be more frequent in country with great inequality & nbsp;and that make sense & nbsp;when family have less to spend that mean business have few customer and household rack up great mortgage and credit card debt meanwhile concentrated wealth at the top be less likely to result in the kind of broadly base consumer spending that drive economy and together with lax regulation may contribute to risky speculative bubble & nbsp and rise inequality and decline mobility be also bad for family and social cohesion not just because tend to trust institution less but study show actually tend to trust each other less when there ’s great inequality & nbsp;and great inequality be associate with less mobility between generation & nbsp;that mean ’s not just temporary the effect last & nbsp;it create a vicious cycle & nbsp;for example by the time turn a child bear into a low income home hear few word than a child from a well off family which mean by the time start school ’s already behind and that deficit can compound over time & nbsp and finally rise inequality and decline mobility be bad for democracy & nbsp;ordinary folk can not write massive campaign check or hire high price lobbyist and lawyer to secure policy that tilt the playing field in favor at everyone else ’s expense & nbsp;and so people get the bad taste that the system be rig and that increase cynicism and polarization and decrease the political participation that be a requisite part of system of self government & nbsp so this be an issue that have to tackle head on & nbsp;and if in fact the majority of americans agree that number priority be to restore opportunity and broad base growth for all americans the question be why have washington consistently fail to act & nbsp;and think a big reason be the myth that have develop around the issue of inequality & nbsp first there be the myth that this be a problem restrict to a small share of predominantly minority poor that this be not a broad base problem this be a black problem or a hispanic problem or a native|american problem & nbsp;now ’s true that the painful legacy of discrimination mean that african|americans latinos native|americans be far more likely to suffer from a lack of opportunity high unemployment high poverty rate & nbsp;it ’s also true that woman still make 77|cent on the dollar compare to man & nbsp;so be go to need strong application of antidiscrimination law & nbsp;we’re go to need immigration reform that grow the economy and take people out of the shadow & nbsp;we’re go to need target initiative to close those gap & nbsp;(applause & nbsp & nbsp but here ’s an important point & nbsp;the decade long shift in the economy have hurt all group & nbsp;poor and middle class inner city and rural folk man and woman and americans of all race & nbsp;and as a consequence some of the social pattern that contribute to decline mobility that be once attribute to the urban poor that ’s a particular problem for the inner city single parent household or drug abuse turn out now be see that pop up everywhere & nbsp & nbsp a new study show that disparity in education mental health obesity absent father isolation from church isolation from community group these gap be now as much about grow up rich or poor as be about anything else & nbsp;the gap in test score between poor kid and wealthy kid be now nearly twice what be between white kid and black kid & nbsp;kids with work class parent be time likeli than kid with middle- or upper class parent to go through a time when parent have no income & nbsp;so the fact be this & nbsp;the opportunity gap in america be now as much about class as be about race and that gap be grow & nbsp so if be go to take on grow inequality and try to improve upward mobility for all people have get to move beyond the false notion that this be an issue exclusively of minority concern & nbsp;and have to reject a politic that suggest any effort to address in a meaningful way somehow pit the interest of a deserve middle class against those of an undeserving poor in search of handout & nbsp;(applause & nbsp second need to dispel the myth that the goal of grow the economy and reduce inequality be necessarily in conflict when should actually work in concert & nbsp;we know from history that economy grow best from the middle out when growth be more widely share & nbsp;and know that beyond a certain level of inequality growth actually slow altogether & nbsp third need to set aside the belief that government can not do anything about reduce inequality & nbsp;it ’s true that government can not prevent all the downside of the technological change and global competition that be out there right now and some of those force be also some of the thing that be help grow & nbsp;and ’s also true that some program in the past like welfare before be reform be sometimes poorly design create disincentive to work & nbsp but have also see how government action time and again can make an enormous difference in increase opportunity and bolster ladder into the middle class & nbsp;investments in education law establish collective bargaining and a minimum wage these all contribute to rise standard of live for massive number of americans & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;likewise when previous generation declare that every citizen of this country deserve a basic measure of security a floor through which could not fall help million of americans live in dignity and give million more the confidence to aspire to something well by take a risk on a great idea & nbsp & nbsp without social|security nearly|half of senior would be live in poverty half & nbsp;today fewer|than|1 in do & nbsp;before medicare only|half of all senior have some form of health insurance & nbsp;today virtually all do & nbsp;and because have strengthen that safety net and expand pro - work and pro - family tax credit like the|earned|income|tax|credit a recent study find that the poverty rate have fall by since the|1960s & nbsp;and these endeavor do not just make a well country reaffirm that be a great country & nbsp & nbsp so can make a difference on this & fact that ’s generation ’s task to rebuild america ’s economic and civic foundation to continue the expansion of opportunity for this generation and the next generation & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;and like neera take this personally & nbsp;i’m only here because this country educate grandfather on the|gi|bill & nbsp;when father leave and mom hit hard time try to raise sister and while be go to school this country help make sure do not go hungry & nbsp;when michelle the daughter of a shift worker at a water plant and a secretary want to go to college just like this country help afford until could pay back & nbsp so what drive as a grandson a son a father as an american be to make sure that every striving hardworking optimistic kid in america have the same incredible chance that this country give & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;it have be the drive force between everything have do these|past|five|year & nbsp;and over the course of the|next|year and for the rest of presidency that ’s where should expect administration to focus all effort & nbsp;(applause.)&nbsp & nbsp now will be pleased to know this be not a state of the|union|address & nbsp;(laughter & nbsp;and many of the idea that can make the big difference in expand opportunity have present before & nbsp;but let offer a few key principle just a roadmap that believe should guide in both legislative agenda and administrative effort & nbsp to begin with have to continue to relentlessly push a growth agenda & nbsp;it may be true that in today ’s economy growth alone do not guarantee high wage and income & nbsp;we've see that & nbsp;but what be also true be can not tackle inequality if the economic pie be shrink or stagnant & nbsp;the fact be if be a progressive and want to help the middle class and the work poor have still get to be concern about competitiveness and productivity and business confidence that spur private sector investment & nbsp & nbsp and that ’s why from day have work to get the economy grow and help business hire & nbsp;and thank to resilience and innovation have create nearly|8|million new job over the|past|44|month & nbsp;and now have get to grow the economy even faster & nbsp;and have get to keep work to make america a magnet for good middle class job to replace the one that have lose in recent|decades job in manufacturing and energy and infrastructure and technology & nbsp;&nbsp and that mean simplify corporate tax code in a way that close wasteful loophole and end incentive to ship job overseas & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;and by broaden the base can actually lower rate to encourage more company to hire here and use some of the money save to create good job rebuild road and bridge and airport and all the infrastructure business need & nbsp & nbsp mean a trade agenda that grow export and work for the middle class & nbsp;it mean streamline regulation that be outdate or unnecessary or too costly & nbsp;and mean come together around a responsible budget one that grow economy faster right now and shrink long term deficit that unwind the harmful sequester cut that have not make a lot of sense applause and then free up resource to invest in thing like the scientific research that be always unleashed new innovation and new industry & nbsp & nbsp when come to budget should not be stick in a stale debate from two|years|ago or & nbsp;a relentlessly grow deficit of opportunity be a big threat to future than rapidly shrink fiscal deficit & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;&nbsp & nbsp so that ’s step towards restore mobility & nbsp;make sure economy be grow faster & nbsp;step be make sure empower more americans with the skill and education need to compete in a highly competitive global economy & nbsp & nbsp know that education be the most important predictor of income today so launch a|race|to|the|top in school & nbsp;we’re supporting state that have raise standard for teaching and learning & nbsp;we’re pushing for redesign high school that graduate more kid with the technical training and apprenticeship and in demand high tech skill that can lead directly to a good job and a middle class life & nbsp know ’s harder to find a job today without some high education so have help more student go to college with grant and loan that go farther than before & nbsp;we’ve make more practical to repay those loan & nbsp;and today more student be graduate from college than ever before & nbsp;we’re also pursue an aggressive strategy to promote innovation that rein in tuition cost & nbsp;we’ve get low cost so that young people be not burden by enormous debt when make the right decision to get high education & nbsp;and next|week michelle and will bring together college president and non - profit to lead a campaign to help more low income student attend and succeed in college & nbsp;(applause.)&nbsp & nbsp but while high education may be the sure path to the middle class ’s not the only & nbsp;so should offer people the good technical education in the world & nbsp;that ’s why have work to connect local business with community college so that worker young and old can earn the new skill that earn more money.&nbsp & nbsp and have also embrace an idea that know all of at the|center|for|american|progress have champion and by the way republican governor in a couple of state have champion and that ’s make high quality preschool available to every child in america & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;we know that kid in these program grow up likeli to get more education earn high wage form more stable family of own & nbsp;it start a virtuous cycle not a vicious one & nbsp;and should invest in that & nbsp;we should give all of child that chance & nbsp and as empower young people for future success the third part of this middle class economic be empower worker & nbsp;it ’s time to ensure collective bargaining law function as be suppose to applause so union have a level playing field to organize for a well deal for worker and well wage for the middle class & nbsp;it ’s time to pass the|paycheck|fairness|act so that woman will have more tool to fight pay discrimination & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;it ’s time to pass the|employment|non discrimination|act so worker can not be fire for who be or who love & nbsp;(applause & nbsp & nbsp and even though be bring manufacture job back to america be create more good pay job in education and health care and business service know that be go to have a great and great portion of people in the service sector & nbsp;and know that there be airport worker and fast food worker and nurse assistant and retail salesperson who work tail off and be still live at or barely above poverty & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;and that ’s why ’s well past the time to raise a minimum wage that in real term right now be below where be when harry|truman be in office & nbsp;(applause & nbsp this should not be an ideological question & nbsp;it be adam|smith the father of free market economic who once say who feed clothe and lodge the whole body of the people should have such a share of the produce of own labor as to be tolerably well fed clothe and lodged.”|&nbsp;and for those of who do not speak old english laughter let translate & nbsp;it mean if work hard should make a decent living & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;if work hard should be able to support a family & nbsp & nbsp now all know the argument that have be use against a high minimum wage & nbsp;some say actually hurt low wage worker business will be less likely to hire & nbsp;but there ’s no solid evidence that a high minimum wage cost job and research show raise income for low wage worker and boost short term economic growth & nbsp;(applause & nbsp & nbsp other argue that if raise the minimum wage company will just pass those cost on to consumer & nbsp;but a grow chorus of business small and large argue differently & nbsp;and & nbsp;already there be extraordinary company in america that provide decent wage salary and benefit and training for worker and deliver a great product to consumer & nbsp & nbsp sas in north|carolina offer childcare and sick leave & a company secretary of the interior use to run offer retirement plan and strive to cultivate a good work balance & nbsp;there be company out there that do right by worker & nbsp;they recognize that pay a decent wage actually help bottom line reduce turnover & nbsp;it mean worker have more money to spend to save maybe eventually start a business of own & nbsp & nbsp a broad majority of americans agree should raise the minimum wage & nbsp;that ’s why last|month voter in new|jersey decide to become the 20th state to raise even higher & nbsp;that ’s why yesterday the|d.c.|council vote to do too & nbsp;i agree with those voter & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;i agree with those voter and be go to keep push until get a high minimum wage for hard work americans across the entire country & nbsp;it will be good for economy & nbsp;it will be good for family & nbsp;(applause & nbsp & nbsp number as allude to earlier still need target program for the community and worker that have be hit hardest by economic change and the|great|recession.|&nbsp;these community be no longer limited to the inner city & nbsp;they’re find in neighborhood hammer by the housing crisis manufacture town hit hard by year of plant pack up landlocke rural area where young folk oftentime feel like have get to leave just to find a job & nbsp;there be community that just be not generate enough job anymore & nbsp & nbsp so have put forward new plan to help these community and resident because have watch city like pittsburgh or hometown of chicago revamp & nbsp;and if give more city the tool to do not handout but a hand up city like detroit can do too & nbsp;so in a|few|weeks will announce the first of these promise zones urban and rural community where be go to support local effort focus on a national goal and that be a child ’s course in life should not be determine by the zip code ’s bear in but by the strength of work ethic and the scope of dream & nbsp;(applause.)&nbsp & nbsp and be also go to have to do more for the long term unemployed & nbsp;for people who have be out of work for more|than|six|month often through no fault of own life be a catch-22 & nbsp;companies will not give résumé an honest look because have be lay off so long but have be lay off so long because company will not give résumé an honest look & nbsp;(laughter.)|&nbsp;and that ’s why earlier|this|year challenge ceo from some of america ’s good company to give these americans a fair shot & nbsp;and next|month many of will join at the|white|house for an announcement about this & nbsp fifth have get to revamp retirement to protect americans in their|golden|years to make sure another housing collapse do not steal the saving in home & nbsp;we've also get to strengthen safety net for a new age so do not just protect people who hit a run of bad luck from fall into poverty but also propel back out of poverty & nbsp today nearly|half of full time worker and of part time worker do not have a pension or retirement account at job & nbsp;about half of all household do not have any retirement saving & nbsp;so be go to have to do more to encourage private saving and shore up the promise of social|security for future generation & nbsp;and remember these be promise make to one another & nbsp;we do not do to replace the free market but do to reduce risk in society by give people the ability to take a chance and catch if fall & nbsp;one study show that more|than|half of americans will experience poverty at some point during adult life & nbsp;think about that & nbsp;this be not an isolated situation & nbsp;more than half of americans at some point in life will experience poverty & nbsp & nbsp that ’s why have nutrition assistance or the program know as snap because make a difference for a mother who ’s work but be just have a hard time put food on the table for kid & nbsp;that ’s why have unemployment insurance because make a difference for a father who lose job and be out there look for a new one that can keep a roof over kid ' head & nbsp;by the way christmastime be no time for congress to tell more|than|1|million of these americans that have lose unemployment insurance which be what will happen if congress do not act before leave on holiday vacation & nbsp;(applause.)&nbsp & nbsp the point be these program be not typically hammock for people to just lie back and relax & nbsp;these program be almost always temporary mean for hardworke people to stay afloat while try to find a new job or go into school to retrain for the job that be out there or sometimes just to cope with a bout of bad luck & nbsp;progressive should be open to reform that actually strengthen these program and make more responsive to a economy & nbsp;for example should be willing to look at fresh idea to revamp unemployment and disability program to encourage fast and high rate of re - employment without cut benefit & nbsp;we should not weaken fundamental protection build over generation because give the constant churn in today ’s economy and the disability that many of friend and neighbor live with be need more than ever & nbsp;we should strengthen and adapt to new circumstance so work even better.&nbsp & nbsp but understand that these program of social insurance benefit all of because do not know when may have a run of bad luck & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;we do not know when may lose a job & nbsp;of course for decade there be yawn gap in the safety net that do more than anything else to expose work family to the insecurity of today ’s economy namely broken health care system & nbsp that ’s why fight for the|affordable|care|act applause because americans lose health insurance and even more die each|year because do not have health insurance at all & nbsp;we do because million of family who think have coverage be drive into bankruptcy by out of pocket cost that do not realize would be there & nbsp;tens of million of fellow citizen could not get any coverage at all & nbsp;and dr. king once say of all the form of inequality injustice in health care be the most shocking and inhumane & nbsp & nbsp well not anymore & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;because in the|three|years since pass this law the share of americans with insurance be up the growth of health care cost be down to slow rate in & nbsp;more people have insurance and more have new benefit and protection americans who have gain the right for free preventive care like mammogram and contraception the more|than|7|million americans who have save an average of on prescription medicine every american who will not go break when get sick because insurance can not limit care anymore.&nbsp & nbsp more people without insurance have gain insurance more|than|3|million young americans who have be able to stay on parent ’ plan the more than half a americans and count who be poise to get cover start on january|1st some for the very first time & nbsp and be these number not the one in any poll that will ultimately determine the fate of this law & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;it 's the measurable outcome in reduced bankruptcy and reduced hour that have be lose because somebody could not make to work and healthy kid with well performance in school and young entrepreneur who have the freedom to go out there and try a new idea those be the thing that will ultimately reduce a major source of inequality and help ensure more americans get the start that need to succeed in the future & nbsp have acknowledge more than once that do not roll out part of this law as well as should have & nbsp;but the law be already work in major way that benefit million of americans right now even as have begin to slow the rise in health care cost which be good for family budget good for federal and state budget and good for the budget of business small and large & nbsp;so this law be go to work & nbsp;and for the sake of economic security need to work & nbsp;(applause & nbsp & nbsp and as people in state as different as california and kentucky sign up for health insurance sign up in drove be prove want that economic security & nbsp;if the senate republican leader still think be go to be able to repeal this someday may want to check with the people in home state who be already set to finally have coverage that free from the fear of financial ruin and let afford to take kid to see a doctor & nbsp;(applause & nbsp & nbsp so let end by address the elephant in the room here which be the seem inability to get anything do in washington these|days & nbsp;i realize be not go to resolve all of political debate over the good way to reduce inequality and increase upward mobility this|year or next|year or in & nbsp;but be important that have a serious debate about these issue & nbsp;for the longer that current trend be allow to continue the more will feed the cynicism and fear that many americans be feel right now that will never be able to repay the debt take on to go to college will never be able to save enough to retire will never see own child land a good job that support a family & nbsp and that ’s why even as will keep on offer own idea for expand opportunity will also keep challenge and welcome those who oppose idea to offer own & nbsp;if republicans have concrete plan that will actually reduce inequality build the middle class provide more ladder of opportunity to the poor let hear & nbsp;i want to know what be & nbsp;if do not think should raise the minimum wage let hear idea to increase people ’s earning & nbsp;if do not think every child should have access to preschool tell what would do differently to give a well shot & nbsp & nbsp if still do not like obamacare and know do not laughter even though ’s build on market base idea of choice and competition in the private sector then should explain how exactly would cut cost and cover more people and make insurance more secure & nbsp;you owe to the american people to tell what be for not just what be against & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;that way can have a vigorous and meaningful debate & nbsp;that ’s what the american people deserve & nbsp;that ’s what the time demand & nbsp;it ’s not enough anymore to just say should just get government out of the way and let the unfettered market take care of for experience tell that ’s just not true & nbsp;(applause & nbsp look have never believe that government can solve every problem or should and neither do & nbsp;we know that ultimately strength be ground in people individual out there strive work make thing happen & nbsp;it depend on community a rich and generous sense of community that ’s at the core of what happen at thearc here every|day & nbsp;you understand that turn back rise inequality and expand opportunity require parent take responsibility for kid kid take responsibility to work hard & nbsp;it require religious leader who mobilize congregation to rebuild neighborhood block by block require civic organization that can help train the unemployed link with business for the job of the future & nbsp;it require company and ceo to set an example by provide decent wage and salary and benefit for worker and a shot for somebody who be down on or luck & nbsp;we know that ’s strength people community businesses.&nbsp & nbsp but government can not stand on the sideline in effort & nbsp;because government be & nbsp;it can and should reflect deep value and commitment & nbsp;and if refocus energy on build an economy that grow for everybody and give every child in this country a fair chance at success then remain confident that the future still look bright than the past and that the|best|days for this country love be still ahead & nbsp;(applause & nbsp thank everybody & nbsp;god bless & nbsp;god bless america & nbsp;(applause & nbsp view transcript transcript fellow americans tonight want to talk to about syria why matter and where go from here over the|past|two|year what begin as a series of peaceful protest against the repressive regime of bashar|al assad have turn into a brutal civil war.&nbsp people have be killed.&nbsp million have flee the country.&nbsp in that time america have work with ally to provide humanitarian support to help the moderate opposition and to shape a political settlement.&nbsp but have resist call for military action because can not resolve someone else ’s civil war through force particularly after a|decade of war in iraq and afghanistan the situation profoundly change though on august|21st when assad ’s government gas to death over a people include hundred of children.&nbsp the image from this massacre be sickening:&nbsp man woman child lie in row kill by poison gas.&nbsp other foam at the mouth gasp for breath.&nbsp a father clutch dead child implore to get up and walk.&nbsp on that terrible night the world see in gruesome detail the terrible nature of chemical weapon and why the overwhelming majority of humanity have declare off limit a crime against humanity and a violation of the law of war this be not always the case.&nbsp in world|war|i american gis be among the|many|thousands kill by deadly gas in the trench of europe.&nbsp in world|war|ii the nazis use gas to inflict the horror of the holocaust.&nbsp because these weapon can kill on a mass scale with no distinction between soldier and infant the civilized world have spend a|century work to ban them.&nbsp and in the united|states senate overwhelmingly approve an international agreement prohibit the use of chemical weapon now join by government that represent of humanity on august|21st these basic rule be violate along with sense of common humanity.&nbsp no one dispute that chemical weapon be use in syria.&nbsp the world see thousand of video cell phone picture and social medium account from the attack and humanitarian organization tell story of hospital pack with people who have symptom of poison gas moreover know the assad regime be responsible.&nbsp in the|days lead up|to|august|21st know that assad ’s chemical weapon personnel prepare for an attack near an area where mix sarin gas.&nbsp distribute gasmask to troops.&nbsp then fire rocket from a regime control area into neighborhood that the regime have be try to wipe clear of opposition forces.&nbsp shortly after those rocket land the gas spread and hospital fill with the dying and the wounded.&nbsp know senior figure in assad ’s military machine review the result of the attack and the regime increase shelling of the same neighborhood in the|day that have also study sample of blood and hair from people at the site that test positive for sarin when dictator commit atrocity depend upon the world to look the other way until those horrify picture fade from memory.&nbsp but these thing happened.&nbsp the fact can not be deny the question now be what the|united|states|of|america and the international community be prepared to do about it.&nbsp because what happen to those people to those child be not only a violation of international law ’s also a danger to security let explain why.&nbsp if fail to act the assad regime will see no reason to stop use chemical weapons.&nbsp as the ban against these weapon erode other tyrant will have no reason to think twice about acquire poison gas and use them.&nbsp over time troop would again face the prospect of chemical warfare on the battlefield.&nbsp and could be easy for terrorist organization to obtain these weapon and to use to attack civilians.&nbsp if fighting spill beyond syria ’s border these weapon could threaten ally like turkey jordan and israel.&nbsp and a failure to stand against the use of chemical weapon would weaken prohibition against other weapon of mass destruction and embolden assad ’s ally iran which must decide whether to ignore international law by build a nuclear weapon or to take a more peaceful path this be not a world should accept.&nbsp this be what ’s at stake.&nbsp and that be why after careful deliberation determine that be in the national security interest of the|united|state to respond to the assad regime ’s use of chemical weapon through a target military strike.&nbsp the purpose of this strike would be to deter assad from use chemical weapon to degrade regime ’s ability to use and to make clear to the world that will not tolerate use.&nbsp that be judgment as commander in chief.&nbsp but be also the president of the world ’s old constitutional democracy.&nbsp so even though possess the authority to order military strike believe be right in the absence of a direct or imminent threat to security to take this debate to congress.&nbsp believe democracy be strong when the president act with the support of congress.&nbsp and believe that america act more effectively abroad when stand together.&nbsp this be especially true after a|decade that put more and more war make power in the hand of the president and more and more burden on the shoulder of troop while sideline the people ’s representative from the critical decision about when use force now know that after the terrible toll of iraq and afghanistan the idea of any military action no matter how limited be not go to be popular.&nbsp after all have spend four|and|a|half|year work to end war not to start them.&nbsp troop be out of iraq.&nbsp troop be come home from afghanistan.&nbsp and know americans want all of in washington especially to concentrate on the task of build nation here at home:&nbsp put people back to work educate kid grow middle class ’s no wonder then that be ask hard questions.&nbsp so let answer some of the most important question that have hear from member of congress and that have read in letter that have send to first many of have ask will not this put on a slippery slope to another war & nbsp;one man write to that be still recover from involvement in iraq.”&nbsp a veteran put more bluntly:&nbsp this nation be sick and tired of war answer be will not put american boot on the ground in syria.&nbsp will not pursue an open ended action like iraq or afghanistan.&nbsp will not pursue a prolong air campaign like libya or kosovo.&nbsp this would be a target strike to achieve a clear objective:&nbsp deter the use of chemical weapon and degrade assad ’s capability other have ask whether be worth act if do not take out assad.&nbsp as some member of congress have say there ’s no point in simply do a pinprick strike in syria let make something clear:&nbsp the|united|state military do not do pinpricks.&nbsp even a limited strike will send a message to assad that no other nation can deliver.&nbsp do not think should remove another dictator with force learn from iraq that do so make responsible for all that come next.&nbsp but a target strike can make assad or any other dictator think twice before use chemical weapon other question involve the danger of retaliation.&nbsp do not dismiss any threat but the assad regime do not have the ability to seriously threaten military.&nbsp any other retaliation may seek be in line with threat that face every day.&nbsp neither assad nor ally have any interest in escalation that would lead to demise.&nbsp and ally israel can defend with overwhelming force as well as the unshakeable support of many of have ask a broad question:&nbsp why should get involve at all in a place that be so complicated and as person write to “ those who come after assad may be enemy of human right ’ true that some of assad ’s opponent be extremists.&nbsp but al|qaeda will only draw strength in a more chaotic syria if people there see the world do nothing to prevent innocent civilian from be gas to death.&nbsp the majority of the syrian people and the syrian opposition work with just want to live in peace with dignity and freedom.&nbsp and the|day after any military action would redouble effort to achieve a political solution that strengthen those who reject the force of tyranny and extremism finally many of have asked:&nbsp why not leave this to other country or seek solution short of force?&nbsp as several people write to should not be the world ’s policeman agree and have a deeply hold preference for peaceful solutions.&nbsp over the|last|two|year administration have try diplomacy and sanction warning and negotiation but chemical weapon be still use by the assad regime however over the|last|few|day have see some encouraging signs.&nbsp in part because of the credible threat of u.s. military action as well as constructive talk that have with president putin the russian government have indicate a willingness to join with the international community in push assad to give up chemical weapons.&nbsp the assad regime have now admit that have these weapon and even say would join the|chemical|weapons|convention which prohibit use.&nbsp ’s too early to tell whether this offer will succeed and any agreement must verify that the assad regime keep commitments.&nbsp but this initiative have the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapon without the use of force particularly because russia be of assad ’s strong ally have therefore ask the leader of congress to postpone a vote to authorize the use of force while pursue this diplomatic path.&nbsp be send secretary of state john|kerry to meet russian counterpart on thursday and will continue own discussion with president putin.&nbsp have speak to the leader of of close ally france and and will work together in consultation with russia and china to put forward a resolution at the u.n.|security|council require assad to give up chemical weapon and to ultimately destroy under international control.&nbsp will also give u.n. inspector the opportunity to report finding about what happen on august|21st.&nbsp and will continue to rally support from ally from europe to the americas from asia to the|middle|east who agree on the need for action.&nbsp meanwhile have order military to maintain current posture to keep the pressure on assad and to be in a position to respond if diplomacy fails.&nbsp and tonight give thank again to military and family for incredible strength and sacrifice fellow americans for nearly|seven|decades the|united|state have be the anchor of global security.&nbsp this have mean do more than forge international agreement have mean enforce them.&nbsp the burden of leadership be often heavy but the world be a well place because have bear them.&nbsp and so to friend on the right ask to reconcile commitment to america ’s military might with a failure to act when a cause be so plainly just.&nbsp to friend on the left ask to reconcile belief in freedom and dignity for all people with those image of child writhe in pain and go still on a cold hospital floor.&nbsp for sometimes resolution and statement of condemnation be simply not enough indeed would ask every member of congress and those of watch at home tonight to view those video of the attack and then ask:&nbsp what kind of world will live in if the|united|states|of|america see a dictator brazenly violate international law with poison gas and choose to look the other way franklin|roosevelt once say national determination to keep free of foreign war and foreign entanglement can not prevent from feel deep concern when ideal and principle that have cherish be challenged.”&nbsp ideal and principle as well as national security be at stake in syria along with leadership of a world where seek to ensure that the bad weapon will never be use america be not the world ’s policeman.&nbsp terrible thing happen across the globe and be beyond mean to right every wrong.&nbsp but when with modest effort and risk can stop child from be gas to death and thereby make own child safer over the long run believe should act.&nbsp that ’s what make america different.&nbsp that ’s what make exceptional.&nbsp with humility but with resolve let never lose sight of that essential truth.&nbsp thank you.&nbsp god bless you.&nbsp and god bless the|united|states|of|america view transcript transcript hello warrensburg!&nbsp applause.)&nbsp hello mules!&nbsp applause.)&nbsp hello jennies!&nbsp applause.)&nbsp well know ’s hot.&nbsp

afternoon.&nbsp know that summer be especially a|day as pretty as today ’s tempt to be outside.&nbsp know class do not start for a few more weeks.&nbsp could be over on pine|street beat the heat.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp now that think about may be good that be here instead of get into trouble.&nbsp laughter have just come from knox|college in galesburg illinois where give a pretty long speech on the economy.&nbsp will not repeat the whole thing here.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp but what do want to talk about today be what have talk about when give first big speech as a senator and that ’s where as a country need to go to give every american a chance to get ahead in the|21st and ucm understand how important that applause just a little context here in the period after world|war|ii have a grow middle class that be the engine of prosperity.&nbsp the economy do well in part because everybody be participating.&nbsp and whether own a company or sweep the floor of that company or work anywhere in between america offer a basic bargain:&nbsp if work hard then will be reward with fair wage and benefits.&nbsp will have the chance to buy own home.&nbsp will have the chance to save for retirement.&nbsp will have the protection of decent health insurance.&nbsp but most of all will have the chance to pass on a well life to kids.&nbsp and then what happen be that engine begin to stall.&nbsp the bargain begin to fray.&nbsp so technology make some job obsolete nobody go to a bank teller anymore.&nbsp want to schedule a trip somewhere get online.&nbsp global competition send some job overseas.&nbsp when be in galesburg talk about the maytag plant that use to make household brand there and people thousand of people use to work in the plant and go down to mexico.&nbsp then washington dole out big tax cut to folk at the top income bracket small minimum wage increase for people who be struggling.&nbsp combine all this and the income of the top quadruple from to but the typical family ’s income barely budged.&nbsp so a lot of middle class family begin to feel that the odd be stack against and be right.&nbsp and then for a while this be kind of paper over because have a housing bubble go on and everybody be maxe out on credit card everybody be highly leverage there be a lot of financial deal go around.&nbsp and so look like the economy be go to be do okay but then by the time take office the bottom have fall out.&nbsp and cost as know million of americans job or home or savings.&nbsp and that long term erosion of middle class security be evident for everybody to see now the good news be five|years|later five|year after the crisis first hit america have fight way back.&nbsp so together save an auto industry.&nbsp take on a broken health care system.&nbsp invest in new american technology to reverse addiction to foreign oil.&nbsp double the production of clean energy.&nbsp natural gas take off.&nbsp put in place tough new rule on big bank and mortgage lender and credit card companies.&nbsp change the tax code so be fair for middle class folk and do not just benefit folk at the very top like me.&nbsp laughter.)&nbsp no be true because thing be skew too much towards folk who be already bless already lucky.&nbsp and take all that together and now add all up.&nbsp what have see be over the|past|40|month business have create new jobs.&nbsp this|year be off to strong private sector job growth since applause.)&nbsp export have surge so sell more product make in america to the rest of the world than ever before.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp produce more natural gas than any country on earth.&nbsp be about to produce more of own oil than buy from overseas and that be the first time that be happen in nearly|20 years.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp the cost of health care be grow at slow rate in so be slow the growth of health care costs.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp and deficit be fall at the fast rate in years.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp deficit have be cut by almost|half from the time take office so do this together because americans be gritty and resilient and work hard.&nbsp have be able to clear away the rubble of the financial crisis.&nbsp be start to lay a new foundation for more durable economic growth.&nbsp and with the new revolution in energy and technology and manufacturing and health care be actually poise be in a position to reverse all those force that batter middle class family for too long.&nbsp can start build now an economy where everybody who work hard can get ahead.&nbsp that be all good.&nbsp that be the good news but missouri be here to tell what already know which be be not there yet.&nbsp in some way the trend that have be build for decade this winner take all economy where a few do well and better but everybody else just tread water all those trend be make bad by the recession.&nbsp and reverse these trend have to be washington ’s number priority.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp have to be washington 's number priority.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp put people back to work make sure the economy be work for everybody build the middle class make sure be secure that be high priority.&nbsp that be what be interested applause.)&nbsp because when the economy be work for middle class family solve an awful lot of other problems.&nbsp now the poor start have ladder of opportunity can climb into if work hard.&nbsp a lot of the social tension be reduce because everybody be feel pretty good.&nbsp;&nbsp now unfortunately over the|past|couple|of|year in particular washington have not just ignore this problem have actually make worse.&nbsp and be interested in work with everybody and there be a bunch of not just democrats but also republicans who recognize that washington be not working.&nbsp but have also see a group of folk particularly in the house a group of republicans in congress that suggest would not vote to pay the bill that congress have already run and that fiasco harm a fragile recovery back in have get a grow number of republican senator who be try to get thing do with democratic counterpart just pass an immigration bill that economist say be go to boost economy by more|than|a|trillion dollars.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp but so far at least there be a faction of house republicans who will not let the bill go to the floor for a vote.&nbsp and if ask well okay what be economic agenda for the middle class how be go to grow economy so everybody prosper will start talk about out of control government spending although as say government spending have actually go down and deficit be go down or will talk about obamacare the whole idea that somehow if do not provide health insurance to americans that be go to improve the economy.&nbsp never mind the fact that job growth be a lot faster now than be during the last recovery when obamacare be not around so have get some basic challenge that be just go to have to meet.&nbsp have cut deficit.&nbsp be create job at nearly twice the pace.&nbsp be provide health care for americans that need it.&nbsp but now have to get back and focus on what be important.&nbsp an endless parade of distraction and political posturing and phony scandal can not get in the way of what need to applause.)&nbsp and be here to say be get to stop.&nbsp have get to focus on job and the economy and help middle class family get ahead.&nbsp and if do that be go to solve a whole lot of problems.&nbsp applause and as be think about these issue can not get involve in short term thinking.&nbsp can not have all the same old debates.&nbsp that be not what the moment requires.&nbsp have get to focus on the core economic issue that matter to you.&nbsp and as washington be now prepare for another debate about the budget the stake could not be if do not make the investment america need to make this country a magnet for good job if do not make investment in education and manufacturing and science and research and transportation and information network will be wave the white flag while other country forge ahead in a global economy.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp if just stand by and do nothing be say ’s okay for middle class folk to keep take on the chin.&nbsp and do not think be okay.&nbsp and that be why come here to warrensburg today.&nbsp need involve in this debate to remind washington what ’s at stake.&nbsp and over the|next|several|weeks in town just like this one be go to lay out idea for how build on the cornerstone of what mean to be middle class what take to work way into the middle class a good job with good wage in durable grow industry a good education for kid and worker a home to call own affordable health care that ’s there for when or family member get sick applause a secure retirement even if be not rich applause more ladder of opportunity for people who want to earn way into the middle class as long as be willing to work for it.&nbsp and what need what need be not a month plan or even a year plan need a long term plan base on steady persistent effort to reverse the force that have conspire against middle class family for decades.&nbsp and be confident know there be member of both party who understand what ’s at stake.&nbsp so welcome idea from anybody across the political spectrum.&nbsp but be not go to allow gridlock or inaction or willful indifference to get in this country ’s way.&nbsp have get to get moving.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp so where can act on own be go be not go to wait for congress.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp because the choice that make now be not just go to determine what happen to the young people here at this school ’s go to determine what happen to kid and grandkids.&nbsp so thing really want to focus on here because ucm be do some extraordinary thing want to focus on just briefly that second cornerstone an education that prepare kid and worker for the global competition that will face.&nbsp that be why want to highlight what ’s happen here at the|university|of|central|missouri because guy be do some thing right.&nbsp applause in an age where business know no border job be go to seek out the country that have the most talented skilled citizen and those be the folk who be go to make a good living.&nbsp the|days when the wage for a worker with a high school degree could keep pace with the earning of somebody with a college degree those|day be can see all throughout the midwest where have get folk who a generation ago could just walk into a factory or a plant do not have a lot of skill get train on the job make a good living live out a middle class life.&nbsp that ’s not go to happen anymore.&nbsp technology global competition those thing be not go away.&nbsp so can either throw up hand and resign to lower living standard or can do what america have always do can adapt can pull together can fight back can win.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp and if do not invest in american education then be go to put kid worker country business at a competitive disadvantage.&nbsp because if think ’s if think education be expensive should see how much ignorance be go to cost in the|21st century.&nbsp ’s go to be expensive.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp so what do need to do on education?&nbsp number ’s get to start in the early years.&nbsp and that mean work with state to make high quality preschool available for every year old in america.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp every study show this be a smart investment encourage healthy behavior increase kid ’ success in the classroom increase earn power as grow up reduce rate of teen pregnancy reduce criminal behavior.&nbsp ’s really and any work parent will tell that know kid be in a safe place to learn be a big relief so ’s also important for the parents.&nbsp this idea of early childhood education should not be partisan.&nbsp states with republican governor be do just like a lot of democratic governor be do kid do not care about politics.&nbsp should prove that care about and make this thing happen.&nbsp and be go to keep on push as long as be president until have a situation where every kid be get a good healthy start in life and be prepare when go to school.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp be go to take action on prove idea to upgrade school that do not require congress.&nbsp so for example last|month announce a goal of connect of america ’s student to high speed internet within years.&nbsp be go ahead and take step for that to happen right now.&nbsp now some of may have go to school where have internet in every classroom but a lot of school right now have get maybe a computer lab but if go in the classroom kid do not have in america in this country every child at every desk should have access to the entire world ’s information and every teacher should have the cutting edge technology to help kid succeed and learn.&nbsp be go to make that happen.&nbsp applause have get to rethink high school so that kid graduate with the real world skill that this new age|demands.&nbsp have get to reward the school that forge partnership with local college and business and that focus on the field of the future like science and technology and math and engineering and be go to use the power of office over the|next|few|month to highlight a topic that affect probably everybody here and that be the soar cost of high education.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp now work with democrats to reform the student loan system so that taxpayer dollar be not go to pad the pocket of big bank and instead be go to help student get a college education.&nbsp so million of student be help by that.&nbsp take action to cap loan repayment at of monthly income for responsible borrowers.&nbsp a lot of young people do not know this but if have take out federal loan then if choose a job let say that do not pay as much as would like or deserve if be a teacher or some other profession only have to pay of income which mean that can afford to go to college and know that be not go to be break when graduate which be important.&nbsp and not enough young people be use applause.)&nbsp as speak and then as speak be work with both party to reverse the doubling of student loan rate that happen a|few|weeks|ago because congress do not get act together.&nbsp have get to get student loan rate interest rate back down.&nbsp applause so these be all good step but here be the problem and this be where what be happen at university|of|central|missouri be so important.&nbsp can put more and more money into student loan can put more and more money into grant but if college cost keep on go up then there be never go to be enough money.&nbsp can keep student loan rate low but if be borrow for college or and get out do not matter whether interest rate be or be still go to have trouble repaying it.&nbsp will take longer to buy a house.&nbsp if have get an idea for a business be go to take longer to invest in start business so have get to do something about college costs.&nbsp family and taxpayer can not just keep pay more and more into an undisciplined system.&nbsp have get to get a well bang for buck.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp so state have to do part by prioritize high education in budget applause because part of the reason tuition have be skyrocket be college be not state fund college be not get as much funding and so then tuition be go up on the back of student and families.&nbsp but have also get to test new way of funding base not just on how many student enroll but how well do.&nbsp and college have to do part by keep cost from go so here at central|missouri be a laboratory for this kind of innovation.&nbsp have a great discussion with not only the president of this university but also the superintendent of school here the head of the community colleges.&nbsp what be happen at ucm be have partner with the|lee’s|summit|school|district with the|metropolitan|community|college with local health care engineering energy and infrastructure firm all industry that be go to drive job growth in the future and everybody be now work together to equip student with well skill allow to graduate faster with less debt and with the certainty of be able to get a job at the other end.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp that be a recipe for success over the long term so have get student at applause there go.&nbsp those student be begin to accrue credit towards an associate ’s degree while be still in high school which mean can come here to earn a bachelor ’s degree in two|year and graduate debt free.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp debt free on a fast track.&nbsp applause and because the community college and industry be involve student be make quick decision about the industry that be go to create job and the business be help to design the program to make sure that have the skill for those job so that not only be graduate debt free but also know that have get a job wait for on the other end.&nbsp applause now that be exactly the kind of innovation need when come to college costs.&nbsp that ’s what be happen right here in warrensburg.&nbsp and want the entire country to notice and want other college to take a look at what be be do here.&nbsp and have ask team to shake the tree all across the country for some of the good idea out there for keep college cost down so that as student prepare to go back to school be in a position to lay out what ’s go to be an aggressive strategy to shake up the system to make sure that middle class student work class student poor kid who have the drive and the wherewithal and want to get a good college education can get without basically mortgage entire future.&nbsp can make this happen but this be an example of the kind of thing have get to focus on instead of a bunch of distraction in washington.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp tackle college cost create more good job establish a well bargain for middle class family and everybody try to work to join into an economy that grow not from the top down but from the middle out that ’s not just what be go to focus on for the|next|few|month that ’s what be go to be focus on for the remainder of presidency.&nbsp and be go to take these plan all across the country and be go to ask folk for help because frankly sometimes just can not wait for congress.&nbsp just take a long time to decide on stuff.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp so be go to reach out to ceo and be go to reach out to worker and be go to reach out to college president and be go to reach out to students.&nbsp will talk to democrats and independent and yes will be ask republicans to get involve because this have to be core project for want to lay out idea to give the middle class a well shot in the 21st century.&nbsp and look want republicans to lay out ideas.&nbsp if have get a well idea to bring down college cost that have not think of let hear them.&nbsp be ready to go.&nbsp if have get a well plan to make sure that every american know the security of affordable health care then please share with the class.&nbsp raise hand.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp but what can not do be just manufacture another crisis because think may be good politic just as economy be get some traction.&nbsp what can not do be shut down government just because be for open the government.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp can not threaten not to pay the bill this country rack up or to cut investment in education and science and basic research that be go to help grow.&nbsp if be go to manage deficit and debt let do in a sensible way.&nbsp can do this if work together.&nbsp and may seem hard right now but if be willing to take a few bold step if washington will just shake off complacency set aside the kind of slash and burn partisanship that have see over the|past|few|year promise economy will be strong a|year|from|now just like ’s strong now than be last and then will be strong five|years|from|now and then will be strong 10|year from now.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp and more americans will have the pride of a first paycheck.&nbsp and more americans will have the satisfaction of start own business and flip that sign that say “ open”.&nbsp more folk will have the thrill of march across the stage to earn a diploma from a university like this and then know that have get a job wait for when graduate what make special a lot of time talk about american exceptionalism and how much love this country and there be so many wonderful thing about country.&nbsp but what make the envy of the world have not just be ability to generate incredible wealth for a few people ’s the fact that have give everybody a chance to pursue own true measure of happiness.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp that ’s who are.&nbsp have not just want success for want for neighbors.&nbsp want for neighborhoods.&nbsp that ’s why do not call bob ’s dream or barbara ’s dream or barack ’s dream call the american dream.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp ’ one that share.&nbsp that be who be the idea that no matter who be what look like where come from who love can make here in america if be try hard.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp that ’s what a college education can be all about.&nbsp that ’s what inspire president that ’s what inspire the faculty.&nbsp that ’s why when see young people like be inspire because be an expression of that idea.&nbsp and have get to make sure that that continue not just for this generation but for the next generation.&nbsp and have get a|hundre have get leave in presidency.&nbsp and be go to spend every|minute every second as long as have the privilege of be in this office make sure that be do every single thing that can so that middle class family work family people who be out there struggle that know that that work can lead to a well place.&nbsp and be go to make sure that that american|dream be available for everybody not just now but in the future.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp so thank missouri.&nbsp thank ucm.&nbsp thank mules.&nbsp thank jennies.&nbsp god bless you.&nbsp god bless the|united|state of america.&nbsp let get to work.&nbsp applause view transcript transcript want to come out here first of all to tell that jay be prepare for all question and be very much look forward to the session.&nbsp the second thing be want to let know that over the|next|couple|of|week there ’s go to obviously be a whole range of issue immigration economic et cetera will try to arrange a fuller press conference to address question the reason actually want to come out today be not to take question but to speak to an issue that obviously have get a lot of attention over the course of the|last|week the issue of the trayvon|martin|ruling.&nbsp give a preliminary statement right after the ruling on sunday.&nbsp but watch the debate over the course of the|last|week think may be useful for to expand on thought a little bit first of all want to make sure that once again send thought and prayer as well as michelle ’s to the family of trayvon|martin and to remark on the incredible grace and dignity with which have deal with the entire situation.&nbsp can only imagine what be go through and ’s remarkable how have handle the second thing want to say be to reiterate what say on sunday which be there ’s go to be a lot of argument about the legal issue in the case will let all the legal analyst and talk head address those issues.&nbsp the judge conduct the trial in a professional manner.&nbsp the prosecution and the defense make arguments.&nbsp the jury be properly instruct that in a case such as this reasonable doubt be relevant and render a verdict.&nbsp and once the jury have speak that be how system works.&nbsp but do want to just talk a little bit about context and how people have respond to and how people be feeling.&nbsp know when trayvon|martin be first shot say that this could have be son.&nbsp another way of say that be trayvon|martin could have be ago.&nbsp and when think about why in the african|american community at least there ’s a lot of pain around what happen here think ’ important to recognize that the african|american community be look at this issue through a set of experience and a history that do not go away there be very few african|american man in this country who have not have the experience of be follow when be shop in a department store.&nbsp that include me.&nbsp there be very few african|american man who have not have the experience of walk across the street and hear the lock click on the door of cars.&nbsp that happen to at least before be a senator.&nbsp there be very few african|american who have not have the experience of get on an elevator and a woman clutch purse nervously and hold breath until have a chance to get off.&nbsp that happen often and do not want to exaggerate this but those set of experience inform how the african|american community interpret what happen one|night in florida.&nbsp and ’ inescapable for people to bring those experience to bear.&nbsp the african|american community be also knowledgeable that there be a history of racial disparity in the application of criminal law everything from the death penalty to enforcement of drug laws.&nbsp and that end up have an impact in term of how people interpret the case now this be not to say that the african american community be naïve about the fact that african|american young man be disproportionately involve in the criminal justice system that be disproportionately both victim and perpetrator of violence.&nbsp ’s not to make excuse for that fact although black folk do interpret the reason for that in a historical context.&nbsp understand that some of the violence that take place in poor black neighborhood around the country be bear out of a very violent past in this country and that the poverty and dysfunction that see in those community can be trace to a very difficult history and so the fact that sometimes that ’s unacknowledge add to the frustration.&nbsp and the fact that a lot of african|american boy be paint with a broad brush and the excuse be give well there be these statistic out there that show that african|american boy be more violent use that as an excuse to then see son treat differently cause pain think the african|american community be also not naïve in understanding that statistically somebody like trayvon|martin be statistically more likely to be shoot by a peer than be by somebody else.&nbsp so folk understand the challenge that exist for african|american boys.&nbsp but get frustrated think if feel that there ’s no context for and that context be be deny and that all contribute think to a sense that if a white male teen be involve in the same kind of scenario that from top to bottom both the outcome and the aftermath may have be different now the question for at least and think for a lot of folk be where do take this?&nbsp how do learn some lesson from this and move in a positive direction?&nbsp think ’ understandable that there have be demonstration and vigil and protest and some of that stuff be just go to have to work way through as long as remain nonviolent.&nbsp if see any violence then will remind folk that that dishonor what happen to trayvon|martin and family.&nbsp but beyond protest or vigil the question be be there some concrete thing that may be able to know that eric|holder be review what happen down there but think ’ important for people to have some clear expectation here.&nbsp traditionally these be issue of state and local government the criminal code.&nbsp and law enforcement be traditionally do at the state and local level not at the federal level that do not mean though that as a nation can not do some thing that think would be productive.&nbsp so let just give a couple of specific that be still bounce around with staff so be not roll out some point plan but some area where think all of could potentially focus number precisely because law enforcement be often determine at the state and local level think would be productive for the|justice|department governor mayor to work with law enforcement about training at the state and local level in order to reduce the kind of mistrust in the system that sometimes currently exists.&nbsp when be in illinois pass racial profiling legislation and actually do just simple things.&nbsp collect datum on traffic stop and the race of the person who be stopped.&nbsp but the other thing be resource training police department across the state on how to think about potential racial bias and way to further professionalize what be doing.&nbsp and initially the police department across the state be resistant but actually come to recognize that if be do in a fair straightforward way that would allow to do job better and community would have more confidence in and in turn be more helpful in apply the law.&nbsp and obviously law enforcement have get a very tough job so that ’s area where think there be a lot of resource and good practice that could be bring to bear if state and local government be receptive.&nbsp and think a lot of would be.&nbsp and let figure out be there way for to push out that kind of training along the same line think would be useful for to examine some state and local law to see if if be design in such a way that may encourage the kind of altercation and confrontation and tragedy that see in the florida case rather than diffuse potential altercations.&nbsp know that there be be commentary about the fact that the stand ground law in florida be not use as a defense in the case.&nbsp on the other hand if be send a message as a society in community that someone who be arm potentially have the right to use those firearm even if there be a way for to exit from a situation be that really go to be contribute to the kind of peace and security and order that would like to and for those who resist that idea that should think about something like these stand ground law would just ask people to consider if trayvon|martin be of age and armed could have stand ground on that sidewalk?&nbsp and do actually think that would have be justify in shoot mr. zimmerman who have follow in a car because feel threatened?&nbsp and if the answer to that question be at least ambiguous then seem to that may want to examine those kind of law number and this be a long term project need to spend some time in think about how do bolster and reinforce african american boys.&nbsp and this be something that michelle and talk a lot about.&nbsp there be a lot of kid out there who need help who be get a lot of negative reinforcement.&nbsp and be there more that can do to give the sense that country care about and value and be willing to invest in be not naïve about the prospect of some grand new federal program.&nbsp be not sure that that ’s what be talk about here but do recognize that as president have get some convening power and there be a lot of good program that be be do across the country on this front.&nbsp and for to be able to gather together business leader and local elect official and clergy and celebrity and athlete and figure out how be do a well job help young african|american man feel that be a full part of this society and that have get pathway and avenue to succeed think that would be a pretty good outcome from what be obviously a tragic situation.&nbsp and be go to spend some time work on that and think about that.&nbsp and then finally think be go to be important for all of to do some soul searching.&nbsp there have be talk about should convene a conversation on race.&nbsp have not see that be particularly productive when politician try to organize conversations.&nbsp end up be stilte and politicize and folk be lock into the position already have.&nbsp on the other hand in family and church and workplace there be the possibility that people be a little bit more honest and at least ask own question about be wring as much bias out of as be judge people as much as can base on not the color of skin but the content of character?&nbsp that would think be an appropriate exercise in the wake of this tragedy and let just leave with a final thought that as difficult and challenging as this whole episode have be for a lot of people do not want to lose sight that thing be get better.&nbsp each successive generation seem to be make progress in change attitude when come to race.&nbsp do not mean be in a post - racial society.&nbsp do not mean that racism be eliminated.&nbsp but when talk to malia and sasha and listen to friend and seem interact be better than be be better than be on these issues.&nbsp and that ’s true in every community that have visit all across the country and so have to be vigilant and have to work on these issues.&nbsp and those of in authority should be do everything can to encourage the well angel of nature as oppose to use these episode to heighten divisions.&nbsp but should also have confidence that kid these|days think have more sense than do back then and certainly more than parent do or grandparent do and that along this long difficult journey be become a more perfect union not a perfect union but a more perfect union thank guy view transcript transcript hello connecticut.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp thank you.&nbsp well thank so much everybody.&nbsp let begin by thank nicole and ian for brave words.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp want to thank

morning.&nbsp every family in this country be shaken.&nbsp hug kid more tightly.&nbsp ask what could do as a society to help prevent a tragedy like that from happen again.&nbsp and as a society decide that have to change.&nbsp must.&nbsp must change.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp notice that nicole and other refer to that|day as “ for these family be a|day that change everything.&nbsp and know many of in newtown wonder if the rest of would live up to the promise make in those dark day if would change too or if once the television truck leave once the candle flicker out once the teddy bear be carefully

determined as ever to do what must be done.&nbsp in fact be here to ask to help show that can get done.&nbsp be not forgetting.&nbsp applause can not forget.&nbsp family still grieve in way most of can not comprehend.&nbsp but so many of have use that grief to make a difference not just to honor own child but to protect the life of all of children.&nbsp so many of have mobilize and organize and petition elect official “ with love and logic as nicole put as citizen determine to right something go wrong and last|week here in connecticut elect leader responded.&nbsp the connecticut legislature lead by many of the legislator here today pass new measure to protect more of child and community from gun violence.&nbsp and governor malloy sign that legislation into law.&nbsp applause so want to be clear.&nbsp the family of newtown people across connecticut help make that happen.&nbsp voice determination make that happen.&nbsp obviously the elect leader do an extraordinary job move forward but could not have happen if be not hear from people in respective district people all across the state.&nbsp that be the power of voice and by the way connecticut be not alone.&nbsp in the|past|few|month new|york colorado maryland have all pass new common sense gun safety reform as well.&nbsp applause these be all state that share an awful familiarity with gun violence whether ’s the horror of mass killing or the street crime that ’s too common in too many neighborhoods.&nbsp all of these state also share a strong tradition of hunting and sport shooting and gun ownership.&nbsp ’s be a part of the fabric of people ’s live for generations.&nbsp and every single of those state include here in connecticut decide that yes can protect more of citizen from gun violence while still protect second|amendment rights.&nbsp those thing do not contradict each other.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp can pass common sense law that protect kid and protect right so connecticut have show the way.&nbsp and now be the time for congress to do the same.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp now be the time for congress to do the same.&nbsp this|week be the time for congress to do the same.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp now back in january just|a|few|month after the tragedy in newtown announce a series of executive action to reduce gun violence and keep kid safe.&nbsp and put forward common sense proposal much like those that pass here in connecticut for congress to consider.&nbsp and will remember in state of the union address urge congress to give those proposal a vote.&nbsp and that moment be now.&nbsp as soon as this|week congress will begin debate these common sense proposal to reduce gun violence.&nbsp senator dick|blumenthal and chris|murphy be here applause representatives john|larson rosa|delauro elizabeth|esty jim|hines joe|courtney be all push to pass this legislation.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp but much of congress be go to only act if hear from the american people.&nbsp so here ’s what have to audience love mr. president.&nbsp the appreciate that.&nbsp laughter.)&nbsp here be what have get to have to tell congress ’s time to require a background check for anyone who want to buy a gun so that people who be dangerous to and other can not get hand on a gun.&nbsp let make that happen.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp have to tell congress ’s time to crack down on gun trafficking so that folk will think twice before buy a gun as part of a scheme to arm someone who will not pass a background check.&nbsp let get that done.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp have to tell congress ’s time to restore the ban on military style assault weapon and a 10-round limit for magazine to make harder for a gunman to fire bullet into victim in less|than|five|minutes.&nbsp let put that to a vote.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp have to tell congress ’s time to strengthen school safety and help people struggle with mental health problem get the treatment need before ’s too late.&nbsp let do that for kid and for communities.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp now know that some of these proposal inspire more debate than other but each of have the support of the majority of the american people.&nbsp all of be common sense.&nbsp all of deserve a vote.&nbsp all of deserve a vote.&nbsp applause consider background checks.&nbsp over the|past|20|year background check have keep more|than|2|million dangerous people from get hand on a gun.&nbsp a group of police officer in colorado tell last|week that thank to background check have be able to stop convict murderer folk under restrain order for commit violent domestic abuse from buy a gun.&nbsp in some case have actually arrest the person as be come to purchase the gun so know that background check can work.&nbsp but the problem be loophole in the current law let so many people avoid background check altogether.&nbsp that ’s not safe.&nbsp do not make sense.&nbsp if be a law abide citizen and go through a background check to buy a gun would not expect other people to play by the same rules?&nbsp applause if be a law abide gun seller would not want to know be not sell gun to someone who ’s likely to commit a crime?&nbsp applause.)&nbsp should not make harder not easy for somebody who be convict of domestic abuse to get hand on a applause turn out of americans think so.&nbsp ninety|percent of americans support universal background checks.&nbsp think about that.&nbsp how often do of americans agree on anything?&nbsp laughter.)&nbsp and yet agree on this republicans democrats folk who own gun folk who do not own gun of republicans more|than|80|percent of gun owner more|than|70|percent of nra households.&nbsp be common sense and yet there be only|one thing that can stand in the way of change that just about everybody agree on and that ’s politic in washington.&nbsp would think that with those number congress would rush to make this happen.&nbsp that be what would think.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp if democracy be work the way ’s suppose to and of the american people agree on something in the wake of a tragedy would think this would not be a heavy lift and yet some folk back in washington be already float the idea that may use political stunt to prevent vote on any of these reforms.&nbsp think about that.&nbsp be not just say will vote no ” on idea that almost all americans support.&nbsp be say will do everything can to even prevent any vote on these provisions.&nbsp be say opinion do not matter.&nbsp and that ’s not right booo the that be not right.&nbsp want a vote the need a vote want a vote!&nbsp want a vote!&nbsp the need a vote want a vote the now have also hear some in the washington press suggest that what happen to gun violence legislation in congress this|week will either be a political victory or defeat for connecticut this be not about this be not about politics.&nbsp this be about do the right thing for all the family who be here that have be tear apart by gun violence.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp ’ about and all the family go forward so can prevent this from happen again.&nbsp that ’s what ’s ’s about the law enforcement official put life at risk.&nbsp that ’s what this be about.&nbsp this be not about politics.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp this be not about politic this be about these family and family all across the country who be say let make a little hard for kid to get gun down.&nbsp when say in state of the union address that these proposal deserve a vote that family of newtown and aurora and tucson and a former member of congress gabby|giffords that all deserve a vote virtually every member of that chamber stand up and applauded.&nbsp and now be go to start deny family a vote when the camera be off and when the lobbyist have work what do?&nbsp deserve well than that.&nbsp deserve a vote now look know from the beginning of this debate that change would not be easy.&nbsp know that there would be powerful interest that be very good at confuse the subject that be good at amplify conflict and extreme that be good at drown out rational debate good at gin up irrational fear all of which stand in the way of progress but if history teach anything then ’ up to –- the people to stand up to those who say can not or will not stand up for the change that need.&nbsp and believe that that ’s what the american people be look for.&nbsp when first run for this office say that do not believe the country be as divide as politic would suggest and still believe that.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp know sometimes when watch cable news or talk radio or browse the internet would think man everybody just hate each other everybody be just at each other ’s throats.&nbsp but that ’s not how most americans think about these issues.&nbsp there be good people on both side of every issue.&nbsp so if be go to move forward can not just talk past another.&nbsp have get to listen to another.&nbsp that ’s what governor malloy and all these legislative leader did.&nbsp that ’s why be able to pass bipartisan legislation.&nbsp applause have get stack of letter from gun owner who want to know that care passionately about right to bear arm do not want infringe upon and appreciate every of those letters.&nbsp have learn from them.&nbsp but a lot of those letter what have also say be be not just gun owner be also parent or police officer or veteran and agree that can not stand by and keep let these tragedy happen that with right come some responsibility and obligation to community and and most of all to children.&nbsp can not just think about –- have get to think about “ the people be in colorado.&nbsp tell a story come back from a trip to rural iowa be out there campaigning.&nbsp sometimes would be mile between farm let alone towns.&nbsp and say know come back can understand why somebody would want a gun for protection.&nbsp if somebody drive up into the driveway and barack be not home the sheriff live mile away may want that security.&nbsp so can understand what may be like in term of somebody want that kind of security.&nbsp on the other hand also talk to a hunter last|week who say all experience with gun have be positive but also realize that for other all experience with gun have be negative and when say that think about the mom meet from suburban chicago whose son be kill in a random shooting.&nbsp and this mom tell hate when people tell that son be in the wrong place at the wrong time.&nbsp be on way to school.&nbsp be exactly where be suppose to be.&nbsp be in the right place at the right time and still get shot.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp the kid at sandy|hook be where be suppose to be.&nbsp so be those moviegoer in aurora.&nbsp so be those worshipper in oak|creek.&nbsp so be be at a supermarket listen to the concern of constituents.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp be exactly

of the world the dream of true freedom finally find full expression in the zionist idea to be a free people in homeland.&nbsp that ’s why believe that israel be root not just in history and tradition but also in a simple and profound idea the idea that people deserve to be free in a land of own.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp over the|last|65|year when israel have be at good israelis have demonstrate that responsibility do not end when reach the promise land only begins.&nbsp and so israel have be a refuge for the diaspora welcome jews from europe from the former soviet|union from ethiopia from

may even be an understatement.&nbsp applause & nbsp and israel have achieve all this even as ’s overcome relentless threat to security through the courage of the|israel|defense|force and the citizenry that be so resilient in the face of terror & nbsp this be the story of israel.&nbsp this be the work that have bring the dream of so many generation to life.&nbsp and every step of the way israel have build unbreakable bond of friendship with country the|united|state of america.&nbsp applause & nbsp those tie begin only|11|minute after israeli independence when the|united|states be the first nation to recognize the state of israel.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp as president truman say in explain decision to recognize israel say believe have a glorious future before not just as another sovereign nation but as an embodiment of the great ideal of civilization.”&nbsp and since then have build a friendship that advance shared interests.&nbsp together share a commitment to security for citizen and the stability of the|middle|east and north|africa.&nbsp together share a focus on advance economic growth around the globe and strengthen the middle class within own countries.&nbsp together share a stake in the success of democracy & nbsp but the source of friendship extend beyond mere interest just as have transcend political party and individual leaders.&nbsp america be a nation of immigrants.&nbsp america be strengthen by diversity.&nbsp america be enrich by faith.&nbsp be govern not simply by man and woman but by laws.&nbsp be fuel by entrepreneurship and innovation and be define by a democratic discourse that allow each generation to reimagine and renew union once more.&nbsp so in israel see value that share even as recognize what make different.&nbsp that be an essential part of bond.&nbsp & nbsp now stand here today mindful that for both nation these be some complicated times.&nbsp have difficult issue to work through within own country and face danger and upheaval around the world.&nbsp and when look at young people within the|united|state think about the choice that must make in life to define who will be as a nation in this|21st|century particularly as emerge from war and the bad recession since the|great|depression.&nbsp but part of the reason like talk to young people be because no matter how great the challenge be idealism energy ambition always give hope.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp & nbsp and see the same spirit in the young people here today.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp believe that will shape future.&nbsp and give the tie between country believe future be bind to ours.&nbsp audience interruption & nbsp no no this be part of the lively debate that talk applause.)&nbsp this be good.&nbsp know have to say actually arrange for that because make feel at home.&nbsp laughter.)&nbsp would not feel comfortable if do not have heckler.&nbsp laughter.)&nbsp would like to focus on how and when say in particular young people can work together to make progress in area that will define time security peace and prosperity.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp & nbsp let begin with security.&nbsp be proud that the security relationship between the|united|state and israel have never be stronger.&nbsp never.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp more exercise between military more exchange among political and military and intelligence official than ever before the large program to date to help retain qualitative military edge.&nbsp these be the facts.&nbsp these be not opinion these be facts.&nbsp but to this be not simply measure on a balance sheet.&nbsp know that here in israel security be something personal here be what think about when consider these issues.&nbsp when consider israel ’s security think about child like osher|twito who meet in sderot applause child the same age as own daughter who go to bed at night fearful that a rocket would land in bedroom simply because of who be and where live.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp that reality be why have invest in the iron|dome system to save countless life because those child deserve to sleep better at night.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp that ’s why have make clear time and again that israel can not accept rocket attack from gaza and have stand up for israel ’s right to defend itself.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp and that ’s why israel have a right to expect hamas to renounce violence and recognize israel ’s right to exist applause & nbsp when think about israel ’s security think about|five israelis who board a bus in bulgaria who be blow up because of where come from rob of the ability to live and love and raise families.&nbsp that ’s why every country that value justice should call hizbollah what truly be a terrorist organization.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp because the world can not tolerate an organization that murder innocent civilian stockpile rocket to shoot at city and support the massacre of man and woman and child in syria right now.&nbsp applause the fact that hizbollah ’s ally the assad regime have stockpile of chemical weapon only heighten the urgency.&nbsp will continue to cooperate closely to guard against that danger have make clear to bashar|al assad and all who follow orders:&nbsp will not tolerate the use of chemical weapon against the syrian people or the transfer of those weapon to terrorists.&nbsp the world be watch will hold accountable applause.)&nbsp the syrian people have the right to be free from the grip of a dictator who would rather kill own people than relinquish power.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp assad must go so that syria ’s future can begin.&nbsp because true stability in syria depend upon establish a government that be responsible to people that protect all community within border while make peace with country beyond & nbsp these be the thing think about when think about israel ’s security.&nbsp when consider israel ’s security also think about a people who have a live memory of the holocaust face with the prospect of a nuclear armed iranian government that have call for israel ’s destruction.&nbsp ’s no wonder israelis view this as an existential threat.&nbsp but this be not simply a challenge for israel be a danger for the entire world include the united states.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp a nuclear armed iran would raise the risk of nuclear terrorism.&nbsp would undermine the non - proliferation regime.&nbsp would spark an arm race in a volatile region.&nbsp and would embolden a government that have show no respect for the right of own people or the responsibility of nation & nbsp that ’s why america have build a coalition to increase the cost to iran of fail to meet obligations.&nbsp the iranian government be now under more pressure than ever before and that pressure be increasing.&nbsp be isolated.&nbsp economy be in dire straits.&nbsp leadership be and position in the region and the world have only grow weaker.&nbsp applause & nbsp do believe that all of have an interest in resolve this issue peacefully.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp strong and principled diplomacy be the good way to ensure that the iranian government forsake nuclear weapons.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp peace be far more preferable to war.&nbsp and the inevitable cost the unintended consequence that would come with war mean that have to do everything can to try to resolve this diplomatically.&nbsp because of the cooperation between government know that there remain time to pursue a diplomatic resolution.&nbsp that ’s what america will do with clear eye work with a world that ’s unite and with the sense of urgency that ’s require & nbsp but iran must know this time be not unlimited.&nbsp and have make the position of clear:&nbsp iran must not get a nuclear weapon.&nbsp this be not a danger that can be contain and as president have say all option be on the table for achieve objectives.&nbsp america will do what must to prevent a nuclear armed iran.&nbsp applause & nbsp for young israelis know that these issue of security be root in an experience that be even more fundamental than the press threat of the day.&nbsp live in a neighborhood where many of neighbor have reject the right of nation to exist.&nbsp grandparent have to risk life and all that have to make a place for in this world.&nbsp parent live through war after war to ensure the survival of the jewish state.&nbsp child grow up know that people have never meet may hate because of who be in a region that be full of turmoil and change underneath foot & nbsp so that ’s what think about when israel be face with these challenge –- that sense of an israel that be surround by many in this region who still reject and many in the world who refuse to accept and that ’s why the security of the jewish people in israel be so important.&nbsp can not be take for granted.&nbsp but make no mistake those who adhere to the ideology of reject israel ’s right to exist may as well reject the earth beneath or the sky above because israel be not go anywhere.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp and today want to tell particularly the young people so that there be no mistake here so long as there be atem lo levad be not alone.&nbsp applause & nbsp the question be what kind of future israel will look forward israel be not go anywhere but especially for the young people in this audience the question be what do future hold?&nbsp and that bring to the subject of peace.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp know israel have take risk for peace.&nbsp brave leader menachem|begin yitzhak|rabin reach treaty with of neighbors.&nbsp make credible proposal to the palestinians at annapolis.&nbsp withdraw from gaza and lebanon and then face terror and rockets.&nbsp across the region have extend a hand of friendship and all too often have be confront with rejection and in some case the ugly reality of anti - semitism so believe that the israeli people do want peace and also understand why too many israelis maybe an increase number maybe a lot of young people here today be skeptical that can be achieve & nbsp but today israel be at a crossroads.&nbsp can be tempt to put aside the frustration and sacrifice that come with the pursuit of peace particularly when iron|dome repel rocket barrier keep out suicide bombers.&nbsp there be so many other press issue that demand attention.&nbsp and know that only israelis can make the fundamental decision about country ’s future.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp recognize that also know by the way that not everyone in this hall will agree with what have to say about peace.&nbsp recognize that there be those who be not simply skeptical about peace but question underlying premise have a different vision for israel 's future.&nbsp and that ’s part of a democracy.&nbsp that be part of the discourse between countries.&nbsp recognize that.&nbsp but also believe be important to be open and honest especially with friends.&nbsp also believe that.&nbsp applause politically give the strong bipartisan support for israel in america the easy thing for to do would be to put this issue aside just express unconditional support for whatever israel decide to do that would be the easy political path but want to know that speak to as a friend who be deeply concerned and commit to future and ask to consider points.&nbsp & nbsp first peace be necessary.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp believe that.&nbsp believe that peace be the only path to true security.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp have the opportunity to be the generation that permanently secure the zionist dream or can face a grow challenge to future.&nbsp give the demographic west of the|jordan|river the only way for israel to endure and thrive as a jewish and democratic state be through the realization of an independent and viable palestine.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp that be true.&nbsp there be other factor involved.&nbsp give the frustration in the international community about this conflict israel need to reverse an undertow of isolation.&nbsp and give the march of technology the only way to truly protect the israeli people over the long term be through the absence of war.&nbsp because no wall be high enough and no iron dome be strong enough or perfect enough to stop every enemy that be intent on do so from inflict harm.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp & nbsp and this truth be more pronounced give the change sweep the arab world.&nbsp understand that with the uncertainty in the region people in the street change in leadership the rise of non - secular party in politic be tempting to turn inward because the situation outside of israel seem so chaotic but this be precisely the time to respond to the wave of revolution with a resolve and commitment for peace.&nbsp applause because as more government respond to popular will when israel could seek peace simply with a handful of autocratic leader those|day be peace will have to be make among people not just governments.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp no one no single step can change overnight what lie in the heart and mind of millions.&nbsp no single step be go to erase year of history and propaganda.&nbsp but progress with the palestinians be a powerful way to begin while sideline extremist who thrive on conflict and thrive on division.&nbsp would make a difference.&nbsp applause & nbsp so peace be necessary.&nbsp but peace be also just.&nbsp peace be also just.&nbsp there be no question that israel have face palestinian faction who turn to terror leader who miss historic opportunities.&nbsp that be all true.&nbsp and that ’s why security must be at the center of any agreement.&nbsp and there be no question that the only path to peace be through negotiation which be why despite the criticism have receive the|united|states will oppose unilateral effort to bypass negotiation through the|united|nations.&nbsp have to be do by the parties.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp but the palestinian people ’s right to self determination right to justice must also be applause.)&nbsp put in shoes.&nbsp look at the world through eyes.&nbsp be not fair that a palestinian child can not grow up in a state of own.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp live entire life with the presence of a foreign army that control the movement not just of those young people but parent grandparent every single day.&nbsp ’s not just when settler violence against palestinians go unpunished.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp ’s not right to prevent palestinians from farm land or restrict a student ’s ability to move around or displace palestinian family from homes.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp neither occupation nor expulsion be the answer.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp just as israelis build a state in homeland palestinians have a right to be a free people in own land.&nbsp applause be go off script here for a second but before come here meet with a group of young palestinians from the|age|of|15 to and talk to be not that different from daughters.&nbsp be not that different from daughter or sons.&nbsp honestly believe that if any israeli parent sit down with those kid would say want these kid to succeed want to prosper.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp want to have opportunity just like kid believe that ’s what israeli parent would want for these kid if have a chance to listen to and talk to them.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp believe that now only can determine what kind of democracy will have.&nbsp but remember that as make these decision will define not simply the future of relationship with the palestinians will define the future of israel as well.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp as say be quote be impossible to have a jewish democratic state at the same time to control all of eretz israel.&nbsp if insist on fulfil the dream in entirety be liable to lose applause.)&nbsp or from a different perspective think of what the novelist david|grossman say shortly after lose son as describe the necessity of peace “ a peace of no choice say “ must be approach with the same determination and creativity as approach a war of no choice.”&nbsp applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp now israel can not be expect to negotiate with anyone who be dedicated to destruction.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp but while know have have difference with the|palestinian|authority genuinely believe that do have a true partner in president abbas and prime minister fayyad.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp believe that.&nbsp and have a track record to prove it.&nbsp over the|last|few|year have build institution and maintain security on in way that few could have imagine just a few year ago.&nbsp so many palestinians include young people have reject violence as a means of achieve aspiration there be an opportunity there there ’s a window which bring to third point:&nbsp peace be possible.&nbsp be possible applause.)&nbsp be not say be guaranteed.&nbsp can not even say that be more likely than not.&nbsp but be possible.&nbsp know do not seem that way.&nbsp there be always go to be reason to avoid risk.&nbsp there be cost for failure.&nbsp there will always be extremist who provide an excuse not to act.&nbsp know there must be something exhausting about endless talk about talk and daily controversy and just the grind status quo.&nbsp and be sure there be a temptation just to say ah enough.&nbsp let focus on small corner of the world and family and job and what can control.”&nbsp but be possible negotiations will be necessary but there be little secret about where must lead state for two|peoples.&nbsp state for two|peoples.&nbsp applause there will be difference about how to get there be go to be hard choice along the way.&nbsp arab state must adapt to a world that have changed.&nbsp the|days when could condemn israel to distract people from a lack of opportunity or government corruption or mismanagement those day need to be over.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp now be the time for the arab world to take step toward normalizing relation with israel.&nbsp applause & nbsp meanwhile palestinians must recognize that israel will be a jewish state and that israelis have the right to insist upon security.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp israelis must recognize that continue settlement activity be counterproductive to the cause of peace and that an independent palestine must be viable with real border that have to be drawn.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp have suggest principle on territory and security that believe can be the basis for these talks.&nbsp but for the moment put aside the plan and the process.&nbsp ask instead to think about what can be do to build trust between people & nbsp four|years|ago stand in cairo in front of an audience of young people politically religiously must seem a world away.&nbsp but the thing want be not so different from what the young people here want.&nbsp want the ability to make own decision and to get an education get a good job to worship god in own way to get marry to raise a family the same be true of those young palestinians that meet with this morning.&nbsp the same be true for young palestinians who yearn for a well life in gaza.&nbsp & nbsp that be where peace begin not just in the plan of leader but in the heart of people.&nbsp not just in some carefully design process but in the daily connection that sense of empathy that take place among those who live together in this land and in this sacred city of jerusalem.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp and let say this as a politician can promise this political leader will never take risk if the people do not push to take some risks.&nbsp must create the change that want to see.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp ordinary people can accomplish extraordinary things.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp know this be possible.&nbsp look to the bridge be build in business and civil society by some of here today.&nbsp look at the young people who have not yet learn a reason to mistrust or those young people who have learn to overcome a legacy of mistrust that inherit from parent because simply recognize that hold more hope in common than fear that drive apart.&nbsp voice must be loud than those who would drown out hope.&nbsp hope must light the way forward.&nbsp look to a future in which jews and muslims and christians can all live in peace and great prosperity in this|holy|land.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp believe in that.&nbsp and most of all look to the future that want for own child a future in which a jewish democratic vibrant state be protect and accept for this time and for all time.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp & nbsp there will be many who say this change be not possible but remember this israel be the most powerful country in this region.&nbsp israel have the unshakeable support of the most powerful country in the world.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp israel be not go anywhere israel have the wisdom to see the world as be but this be in nature israel also have the courage to see the world as should be.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp ben|gurion once say in israel in order to be a realist must believe in miracles.”&nbsp sometimes the great miracle be recognize that the world can change.&nbsp that be a lesson that the world have learn from the jewish people & nbsp and that bring to the final area that will focus on prosperity and israel ’s broad role in the world.&nbsp know that all the talk about security and peace can sometimes seem to dominate the headline but that be not where people live.&nbsp and every|day even amidst the threat that face israelis be define by the opportunity that be create through talent and hard work israelis have put this small country at the forefront of the global economy.&nbsp israelis understand the value of education and have produce nobel laureates.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp israelis understand the power of invention and university educate engineer and inventors.&nbsp and that spirit have lead to economic growth and human progress solar power and electric car bandage and prosthetic limb that save life stem cell research and new drug that treat disease cell phone and computer technology that change the way people around the world live.&nbsp so if people want to see the future of the world economy should look at tel|aviv home to hundred of start up and research centers.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp israelis be so active on social medium that every day seem to bring a different facebook campaign about where should give this speech.&nbsp laughter and applause & nbsp that innovation be just as important to the relationship between the|united|state and israel as security cooperation first free trade agreement in the world be reach with israel nearly|three|decades ago.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp today the trade between country be at every applause.)&nbsp more

world.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp that ’s job.&nbsp that ’s job.&nbsp that ’s the task of all of us.&nbsp may god bless you.&nbsp may god bless israel.&nbsp may god bless the|united|state of america.&nbsp toda raba.&nbsp thank you.&nbsp applause view transcript transcript good morning everybody.&nbsp as know just meet with leader of both party to discuss a way forward in light of the severe budget cut that start to take effect today.&nbsp tell these cut will hurt will cost jobs.&nbsp and to set right both side need to be willing to compromise the good news be the american people be strong and be resilient.&nbsp fight hard to recover from the bad economic crisis since the|great|depression and will get through this as well.&nbsp even with these cut in place folk all across this country will work hard to make sure that keep the recovery going.&nbsp but washington sure be not make easy.&nbsp at a time when business have finally begin to get some traction hire new worker bring job back to america should not be make a series of dumb arbitrary cut to thing that business depend on and worker depend on like education and research and infrastructure and ’s unnecessary.&nbsp and at a time when too many americans be still look for work ’s inexcusable now what ’s important to understand be that not everyone will feel the pain of these cut right away.&nbsp the pain though will be begin this|week many middle class family will have life disrupt in significant ways.&nbsp business that work with the military like the virginia shipbuilder that visit on tuesday may have to lay folk off.&nbsp community near military basis will take a serious blow.&nbsp hundreds|of|thousand of americans who serve country border|patrol agent fbi agent civilian who work at the pentagon all will suffer significant pay cut and furloughs.&nbsp all of this will cause a ripple effect throughout layoff and pay cut mean that people have less money in pocket and that mean that have less money to spend at local businesses.&nbsp that mean low profits.&nbsp that mean few hires.&nbsp the longer these cut remain in place the great the damage to economy a slow grind that will intensify with each pass day.&nbsp so economist be estimate that as a consequence of this sequester that could see growth cut by over|one half of percent.&nbsp will cost about|750,000 job at a time when should be grow job more quickly.&nbsp so every time that get a piece of economic news over the|next|month next|two|month next|six|month as long as the sequester be in place will know that that economic news could have be well if congress have not fail to act.&nbsp and let be clear.&nbsp none of this be necessary.&nbsp ’s happen because of a choice that republicans in congress have have allow these cut to happen because refuse to budge on close a single wasteful loophole to help reduce the deficit.&nbsp as recently as yesterday decide to protect special interest tax break for the well off and well connect and think that that ’s apparently more important than protect military or middle class family from the pain of these cuts.&nbsp do believe that can and must replace these cut with a more balanced approach that ask something from everybody:&nbsp smart spending cut entitlement reform tax reform that make the tax code more fair for family and business without raise tax rate all so that can responsibly lower the deficit without lay off worker or force parent to scramble for childcare or slash financial aid for college student do not think that ’s too much to ask.&nbsp do not think that be partisan.&nbsp ’ the kind of approach that have propose for years.&nbsp ’ what run on last and the majority of the american people agree with in this approach include by the way a majority of republicans.&nbsp just need republicans in congress to catch up with own party and country on this.&nbsp and if do so could make a lot of progress do know that there be republicans in congress who privately at least say that would rather close tax loophole than let these cut go through.&nbsp know that there be democrats who ’d rather do smart entitlement reform than let these cut go through.&nbsp so there be a caucus of common sense up on capitol|hill.&nbsp ’s just ’ a silent group right now and want to make sure that voice start get hear in the|coming|days and in the|coming|weeks be go to keep on reach out to both individually and as group of senator or member of the house and say to let fix this not just for but for year to come.&nbsp because the great nation on earth do not conduct business in month to month increment or by careen from crisis to crisis.&nbsp and america have get a lot more work to do in the meantime can not let political gridlock around the budget stand in the way of other area where can make progress.&nbsp be pleased to see that the house pass the violence against women act yesterday.&nbsp that be a big win for not just woman but for family and for the american people.&nbsp ’ a law that ’s go to save life and help more americans live free from ’s something that have be push on for a long time.&nbsp be glad to see that done.&nbsp and ’ an example of how can still get some important bipartisan legislation through this congress even though there be still these fiscal argument take place.&nbsp and think there be other area where can make progress even with the sequester unresolved.&nbsp will continue to push for those initiatives.&nbsp be go to keep push for high quality preschool for every family that want it.&nbsp be go to keep push to make sure that raise the minimum wage so that ’ one that family can live on.&nbsp be go to keep on push for immigration reform and reform voting system and improvement on transportation sector.&nbsp and be go to keep push for sensible gun reform because still think deserve a vote this be the agenda that the american people vote for.&nbsp these be america ’s priorities.&nbsp be too important to go&nbsp unaddressed.&nbsp and be go to keep push to make sure that see through.&nbsp so with that be go to take some questions.&nbsp be go to start with julie q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp thank mr. president.&nbsp how much responsibility do feel like bear for these cut take effect?&nbsp and be the only way to offset at this point for republicans to bend on revenue or do see any alternative the look have already cut in deficit.&nbsp everybody say need to cut which mean have to come up with another and a half.&nbsp the vast majority of economist agree that the problem when come to deficit be not discretionary spending.&nbsp be not that be spend too much money on education.&nbsp be not that be spend too much money on job training or that be spend too much money rebuild road and bridges.&nbsp be not.&nbsp the problem that have be a long term problem in term of health care cost and program like medicare.&nbsp and what have say very specifically very detailed be that be prepared to take on the problem where exist on entitlement and do some thing that own party really do not like if be part of a broad package of sensible deficit reduction.&nbsp so the deal that have put forward over the|last|two|year the deal that put forward as recently as december be still on the table.&nbsp be prepared to do hard thing and to push democratic friend to do hard thing but what can not do be ask middle class family ask senior ask student to bear the entire burden of deficit reduction when know have get a bunch of tax loophole that be benefit the well off and the well connect be not contribute to growth be not contribute to economy.&nbsp be not fair.&nbsp be not right.&nbsp the american people do not think be fair and do not think be right so recognize that speaker boehner have get challenge in caucus.&nbsp recognize that be very hard for republican leader to be perceive as make concession to me.&nbsp sometimes reflect be there something else could do to make these guy be not talk about the leader now but maybe some of the house republican caucus member not paint horn on head.&nbsp and genuinely believe that there be an opportunity for to cooperate.&nbsp but what do not make sense and the only thing that have see from republicans so far in term of proposal be to replace this set of arbitrary cut with even bad arbitrary cuts.&nbsp that be not go to help the economy.&nbsp that be not go to help growth.&nbsp that be not go to create jobs.&nbsp and as a number of economist have note ironically do not even reduce deficit in the smart way possible or the fast way possible.&nbsp so in term of go forward hope be that after some reflection as member of congress start hear from constituent who be be negatively impact as start see the impact that the sequester be have that step back and say all right be there a way for to move forward on a package of entitlement reform tax reform not raise tax rate identify program that do not work come up with a plan that be comprehensive and that make sense.&nbsp and may take a couple of weeks.&nbsp may take a|couple|of|month but be just go to keep on push on and view be that ultimately common sense prevails.&nbsp but what be true right now be that the republicans have make a choice that maintain an ironclad rule that will not accept an extra dime ’s worth of revenue make very difficult for to get any large comprehensive deal.&nbsp and that be a choice be making.&nbsp be say that be more important to preserve these tax loophole than be to prevent these arbitrary cuts.&nbsp and what be interesting be speaker boehner just a couple month ago identify these tax loophole and tax break and say should close and raise revenue.&nbsp so be not as if be not possible to have suggest that be possible to and if believe that in fact these tax loophole and these tax break for the well off and the well connect be not contribute to growth be not good for economy be not particularly fair and can raise revenue well why do not get started?&nbsp why do not do that may be that because of the politic within can not do right now.&nbsp understand that.&nbsp hope be be that can do later.&nbsp and just want to repeat julie because think be very important to understand be not as if democrats be not be ask to do anything either to compromise.&nbsp there be member of party who violently disagree with the notion that should do anything on medicare.&nbsp and be willing to say to disagree with because want to preserve medicare for the long haul.&nbsp and be go to have some tough politic within party to get this done.&nbsp;&nbsp this be not a situation where be only ask for concession from republicans and ask nothing from democrats.&nbsp be say that everybody be go to have to do something.&nbsp and the key to this whole thing be try to make sure keep in mind who be here for.&nbsp be not here for be not here for party be not here to advance electoral prospects.&nbsp be here for american family who have be get batter pretty good over be just start to see the economy improve business be just start to see some confidence come back.&nbsp and this be not a win for anybody this be a loss for the american people and again if step back and just remind what be be suppose to be do here then hopefully common sense will out in the end q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp sound like be say that this be a republican problem and not that bear any responsibility for the well julie give an example of what may do q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp be just try to clarify statement the well no but be try to clarify the question.&nbsp what be suggest be have put forward a plan that call for serious spending cut serious entitlement reform go right at the problem that be at the heart of long term deficit problem.&nbsp have offer negotiation around that kind of balanced approach.&nbsp and so far have get rebuffed because what speaker boehner and the republicans have say be can not do any revenue can not do a dime 's worth of revenue so what more do think should do?&nbsp okay just want to laughter.)&nbsp because if people have a suggestion be happy to this be a room full of smart folk all right zach|goldfarb q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp mr. president the next focal point seem to be the continue resolution that ’s fund the government at the|end|of|the|month that expire at the end of the month.&nbsp would sign a cr that continue the sequester but continue to fund the government?&nbsp and in a related point how do truly reach the limit of persuasive power?&nbsp be there any other leverage have to convince the republicans to convince folk that this be not the way to go the well would like to think have still get some persuasive power left.&nbsp let check.&nbsp laughter.)&nbsp look the issue be not persuasive power.&nbsp the american people agree with approach.&nbsp agree that should have a balance approach to deficit reduction the question be can the american people help persuade member of congress to do the right thing and have a lot of confidence that over time if the american people express displeasure about how something be work that eventually congress responds.&nbsp sometimes there be a little gap between what the american people think and what congress thinks.&nbsp but eventually congress catch up with respect to the budget and keep the government open will try for view audience to make sure that be not talk in washington gobbledygook.&nbsp what ’s call the continue resolution which be essentially just an extension of last|year ’s budget into this year ’s budget to make sure that basic government function continue think ’s the right thing to do to make sure that do not have a government shutdown.&nbsp and that be preventable have a|budget|control|act right?&nbsp agree to a certain amount of money that be go to be spend each|year and certain funding level for military education system and so forth.&nbsp if stick to that deal then will be supportive of stick to that deal.&nbsp ’ a deal that made.&nbsp the sequester be additional cut on top of that.&nbsp and by law until congress take the sequester away would have to abide by those additional cuts.&nbsp but there ’s no reason why should have another crisis by shut the government down in addition to these arbitrary spending cut q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp just to make clear would sign a budget that continue to fund the government even at the low level of the sequester even if do not prefer to do that the zach be not go to never want to make clear with guys.&nbsp laughter.)&nbsp but think ’ fair to say that make a deal for a certain budget certain numbers.&nbsp there ’s no reason why that deal need to be reopened.&nbsp be a deal that speaker boehner make as well and all the leadership made.&nbsp and if the bill that arrive on desk be reflective of the commitment that have previously make then obviously would sign because want to make sure that keep on do what need to do for the american people jessica q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp mr. president to question what could do first of all could not just have down here and refuse to let leave the room until have a deal?&nbsp laughter the mean jessica be not a dictator.&nbsp be the president.&nbsp so ultimately if mitch|mcconnell or john|boehner say need to go to catch a plane can not have secret|service block the doorway right?&nbsp so q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp but be not that part of leadership?&nbsp be sorry to interrupt but be not the understand.&nbsp and know that this have be some of the conventional wisdom that be be float around washington that somehow even though most people agree that be be reasonable that most people agree be present a fair deal the fact that do not take mean that should somehow do a jedi mind meld with these folk and convince to do what ’s right.&nbsp well be elected.&nbsp have a constitutional system of government.&nbsp the speaker of the house and the leader of the senate and all those folk have responsibilities.&nbsp what can do be can make the good possible case for why need to do the right thing.&nbsp can speak to the american people about the consequence of the decision that congress be make or the lack of decision making by congress.&nbsp but ultimately ’ a choice make and this idea that somehow there ’s a secret formula or secret sauce to get speaker boehner or mitch|mcconnell to say know what mr. president be right should close some tax loophole for the well off and well connect in exchange for some serious entitlement reform and spending cut of program do not need.&nbsp think if there be a secret way to do that would have try would have do what can do be can make the good possible argument.&nbsp and can offer concession and can offer compromise.&nbsp can negotiate.&nbsp can make sure that party be willing to compromise and be not be ideological or think about these just in term of political terms.&nbsp and think have do that and will continue to do that but what can not do be force congress to do the right thing.&nbsp the american people may have the capacity to do that.&nbsp and in the absence of a decision on the part of the speaker of the house and other to put middle class family ahead of whatever political imperative may have right now be go to have these cut in place.&nbsp but again be hopeful about human nature.&nbsp think that over time people do the right thing.&nbsp and will keep on reach out and see if there be other formula or other way to jigger this thing into place so that get a well result q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp what do say to the people like mayor bloomberg who be no critic of in general endorse who argue that there be some what call posturing in these claim that there be go to be big layoff and a lot of people out of work and think that the effect of the spending cut be be overstate by the administration the well jessica look will just give an example.&nbsp the|department|of|defense right now have to figure out how the child of military family be go to continue with schooling over because teacher at these army basis be typically be therefore subject to furlough which mean that may not be able to teach one|day|a|week now expect that will be able to manage around but if be a man or woman in uniform in afghanistan right now the notion that spouse back home be have to worry about whether or not kid be get the good education possible the notion that school for child on an army base may be disrupt because congress do not act that be an impact.&nbsp now mayor bloomberg and other may not feel that impact.&nbsp suspect but that family will.&nbsp the border|patrol agent who be out there in the hot sun do what congress say be suppose to be do find out suddenly that be get a 10-percent pay cut and have to go home and explain that to family do not think feel like this be an exaggerated impact.&nbsp so guess depend on where sit now what be absolutely true be that not everybody be go to feel it.&nbsp not everybody be go to feel all at once.&nbsp what be true be that the accumulation of those story all across this country folk who suddenly may have be work all life to get an education just so that can get that job and get out of welfare and have get kid in head start and now suddenly that head start slot be go and be try to figure out how be go to keep job because can not afford child care for kid some of the supplier for those shipbuilder down in virginia where have get some supplier who be small business this be all do and may shut down those company and employee be go to be lay off the accumulation of all of those story of impact be go to make economy weaker.&nbsp be go to mean less growth.&nbsp be go to mean hundreds|of|thousand of job lose that be that ’s not be not make that up.&nbsp that ’s not a scare tactic that ’s a fact start tomorrow everybody here all the folk who be clean the floor at the capitol now that congress have leave somebody be go to be vacuum and clean those floor and throw out the garbage be go to have less pay.&nbsp the janitor the security guard just get a pay cut and have get to figure out how to manage that.&nbsp that ’s real so want to be very clear here.&nbsp be absolutely true that this be not go to precipitate the kind of crisis talk about with america defaulting and some of the problem around the debt ceiling.&nbsp do not anticipate a huge financial crisis but people be go to be hurt.&nbsp the economy will not grow as quickly as would have.&nbsp unemployment will not go down as quickly as would have and there be life behind that.&nbsp and that ’s real.&nbsp and be not necessary that ’s the problem christi parsons q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp thank the hey christi q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp mr. president administration weigh in yesterday on the|proposition|8|case.&nbsp a|few|months|ago look like may be averse to do that and just wonder if could talk a little bit about deliberation and how thinking evolve on that.&nbsp be there conversation that be important to be there thing that read that influence thinking the as everybody here know last|year upon a long period of reflection conclude that can not discriminate against same sex couple when come to marriage that the basic principle that america be found on the idea that be all create equal apply to everybody regardless of sexual orientation as well as race or gender or religion or ethnicity.&nbsp and think that the same evolution that have go through be an evolution that the country as a whole have go through.&nbsp and think be a profoundly positive thing.&nbsp so that when the|supreme|court essentially call the question by take this case about california 's law do not feel like that be something that this administration could avoid.&nbsp feel be important for to articulate what believe and what this administration stand for and although do think that be see on a state by state basis progress be make more and more state recognize same sex couple and give the opportunity to marry and maintain all the benefit of marriage that heterosexual couple do when the|supreme|court ask do think that the california law which do not provide any rationale for discriminate against same sex couple other than just the notion that well be same sex couple if the|supreme|court ask or attorney general or solicitor general do think that meet constitutional muster feel be important for to answer that question honestly and the answer be no q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp and give the fact that do hold that position about gay marriage wonder if think about just once make the decision to weigh in why not just argue that marriage be a right that should be available to all people of this country the well that be an argument that have make personally.&nbsp the solicitor general in institutional role go before the|supreme|court be oblige to answer the specific question before them.&nbsp and the specific question present before the court right now be whether prop|8 and the california law be unconstitutional and what have do be have put forward a basic principle which be which apply to all equal protection cases.&nbsp whenever a particular group be be discriminate against the court ask the question what ’s the rationale for this and better be a good reason.&nbsp and if do not have a good reason be go to strike down and what have say be be that same sex couple be a group a class that deserve heighten scrutiny that the|supreme|court need to ask the state why ’s do and if the state do not have a good reason should be strike down.&nbsp that be the core principle as apply to this case now the court may decide that if do not apply in this case probably can not apply in any case.&nbsp there ’s no good reason for it.&nbsp if be on the court that would probably be the view that would put forward.&nbsp but be not a judge be the president.&nbsp so the basic principle though be let treat everybody fairly and let treat everybody equally.&nbsp and think that the brief that be be present accurately reflect view ari shapiro q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp thank mr. president.&nbsp say a|few|minutes|ago and have say repeatedly that the country have to stop careen from crisis to crisis the right q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp so with a few crisis behind and a few more crisis ahead of take a step back from this specific debate over the sequester how as the leader of this country do plan to stop the country from careen from crisis to crisis the well a couple of number be to make sure that keep make progress wherever can on thing that be important to middle class americans and those who be fight to get into the middle class.&nbsp so if set aside budget fight for a second have be able to get now done.&nbsp the conversation that be take place on a bipartisan basis around immigration reform be move have see great interest in a bipartisan fashion around how can continue to improve education system include around early childhood education.&nbsp there have be constructive discussion around how do reduce gun violence and what be go to keep on try to do be to make sure that push on those thing that be important to families.&nbsp and will not get everything do all at once but can get a lot done.&nbsp so that be point number one.&nbsp with respect to the budget what have do be to make a case to the american people that have to make sure that have a balance approach to deficit reduction but that deficit reduction alone be not an economic policy.&nbsp and part of the challenge that have have here be that not only congress but think washington generally spend all time together about deficit and do not spend a lot of time talk about how do create jobs.&nbsp so want to make sure that be talk about both.&nbsp think that for example could put a lot of people back to work right now rebuild road and bridges.&nbsp and this be defer maintenance.&nbsp know be go to have to do it.&nbsp and go to a bridge that connect mitch|mcconnell 's state to john|boehner 's state and be a rotten bridge and everybody know and will bet really want to see that improved.&nbsp well how do do it?&nbsp let have a conversation about it.&nbsp that will create jobs.&nbsp will be good for business reduce commuter time improve commuter safety.&nbsp that have to be part of this conversation not just this constant argument about cut and spending so guess point be ari that what want to try to do be to make sure that be constantly focus that true north be on how be help american family succeed.&nbsp deficit reduction be part of that agenda and an important part.&nbsp but be not the only part.&nbsp and do not want to be paralyze on everything just because disagree on this thing.&nbsp and as already say to jessica what be also hope be be that over time perhaps after republicans step back and maybe can say know what stick tough on the sequester and this make feel good and the republican caucus be in a well mood when come back maybe then can have a more serious discussion about what the real problem on deficit and deficit reduction are.&nbsp and the good thing about america be that sometimes get to these bottleneck and get stuck and have these sharp partisan fight but the american people pretty steadily be common sense and practical and eventually that common sense practical approach win out.&nbsp and think that be what will happen here as well.&nbsp and in the meantime just to make the final point about the sequester will get through this.&nbsp this be not go to be a apocalypse think as some people have said.&nbsp be just and be go to hurt.&nbsp be go to hurt individual people and be go to hurt the economy overall.&nbsp but if congress come to sens a|week|from|now a|month|from|now three|months|from|now then there be a lot of open running room there for to grow economy much more quickly and to advance the agenda of the american people dramatically.&nbsp so this be a temporary stop on what believe be the long term outstanding prospect for american growth and greatness.&nbsp thank very much view transcript transcript mr. speaker mr. vice president member of congress fellow citizen & nbsp & nbsp one|years|ago john|f.|kennedy declare to this chamber that the constitution make not rival for power but partner for “ be task say to report the|state|of|the|union to improve be the task of all & nbsp & nbsp tonight thank to the grit and determination of the american people there be much progress to report & nbsp;after a|decade of grind war brave man and woman in uniform be come home & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;after year of gruele recession business have create over six|million new job & nbsp;we buy more american car than have in five|years and less foreign oil than have in & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;our housing market be heal stock market be rebound and consumer patient and homeowner enjoy strong protection than ever before & nbsp;(applause & nbsp & nbsp so together have clear away the rubble of crisis and can say with renew confidence that the state of union be strong & nbsp;(applause.)&nbsp & nbsp but gather here know that there be million of americans whose hard work and dedication have not yet be reward & nbsp;our economy be add job but too many people still can not find full time employment & nbsp;corporate profit have skyrocket to all time high but for more|than|a|decade wage and income have barely budge & nbsp & nbsp be generation ’s task then to reignite the true engine of america ’s economic growth a rise thrive middle class & nbsp;(applause & nbsp & nbsp be unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that build this country the idea that if work hard and meet responsibility can get ahead no matter where come from no matter what look like or who love & nbsp be unfinished task to make sure that this government work on behalf of the many and not just the few that encourage free enterprise reward individual initiative and open the door of opportunity to every child across this great nation & nbsp;(applause.)&nbsp & nbsp the american people do not expect government to solve every problem & nbsp;they do not expect those of in this chamber to agree on every issue & nbsp;but do expect to put the nation ’s interest before party & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;they do expect to forge reasonable compromise where can & nbsp;for know that america move forward only when do so together and that the responsibility of improve this union remain the task of all & nbsp work must begin by make some basic decision about budget decision that will have a huge impact on the strength of recovery & nbsp over the|last|few|year both party have work together to reduce the deficit by mostly through spending cut but also by raise tax rate on the wealthy of americans & nbsp;a a result be more than halfway towards the goal of in deficit reduction that economist say need to stabilize finance & nbsp & nbsp & nbsp now need to finish the job & nbsp;and the question be & nbsp in congress pass a law say that if both party could not agree on a plan to reach deficit goal about|a|trillion|dollars ’ worth of budget cut would automatically go into effect this|year & nbsp;these sudden harsh arbitrary cut would jeopardize military readiness & nbsp;they’d devastate priority like education and energy and medical research & nbsp;they would certainly slow recovery and cost hundreds|of|thousands of job & nbsp;that ’s why democrats republicans business leader and economist have already say that these cut know here in washington as the sequester be a really bad idea & nbsp & nbsp now some in congress have propose prevent only the defense cut by make even big cut to thing like education and job training medicare and social|security benefit & nbsp;that idea be even bad & nbsp;(applause & nbsp & nbsp yes the big driver of long term debt be the rise cost of health care for an age population & nbsp;and those of who care deeply about program like medicare must embrace the need for modest reform otherwise retirement program will crowd out the investment need for child and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement for future generation & nbsp & nbsp but can not ask senior citizen and work family to shoulder the entire burden of deficit reduction while ask nothing more from the wealthy and the most powerful & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;we will not grow the middle class simply by shift the cost of health care or college onto family that be already struggle or by force community to lay off more teacher and more cop and more firefighter & nbsp;most americans democrats republicans and independent understand that can not just cut way to prosperity & nbsp;they know that broad base economic growth require a balance approach to deficit reduction with spending cut and revenue and with everybody do fair share & nbsp;and that ’s the approach offer tonight & nbsp on medicare be prepare to enact reform that will achieve the same amount of health care saving by the|beginning|of|the|next|decade as the reform propose by the bipartisan simpson bowles commission & nbsp;(applause & nbsp & nbsp already the|affordable|care|act be help to slow the growth of health care cost & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;and the reform be propose go even further & nbsp;we’ll reduce taxpayer subsidy to prescription drug company and ask more from the wealthy senior & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;we’ll bring down cost by change the way government pay for medicare because medical bill should not be base on the number of test order or day spend in the hospital should be base on the quality of care that senior receive & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;and be open to additional reform from both party so long as do not violate the guarantee of a secure retirement & nbsp;our government should not make promise can not keep but must keep the promise have already make & nbsp;(applause.)&nbsp & nbsp to hit the rest of deficit reduction target should do what leader in both party have already suggest and save hundreds|of|billions|of|dollar by get rid of tax loophole and deduction for the well off and the well connect & nbsp;after all why would choose to make deep cut to education and medicare just to protect special interest tax break & nbsp;how be that fair & nbsp;why be that deficit reduction be a big emergency justify make cut in social|security benefit but not close some loophole & nbsp;how do that promote growth & nbsp;(applause.)&nbsp & nbsp now be good chance for bipartisan comprehensive tax reform that encourage job creation and help bring down the deficit & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;we can get this do & nbsp;the american people deserve a tax code that help small business spend less time fill out complicated form and more time expand and hire a tax code that ensure billionaire with high power accountant can not work the system and pay a low rate than hardworking secretary a tax code that lower incentive to move job overseas and lower tax rate for business and manufacturer that be create job right here in & nbsp;that ’s what tax reform can deliver & nbsp;that ’s what can do together & nbsp;(applause.)&nbsp & nbsp realize that tax reform and entitlement reform will not be easy & nbsp;the politic will be hard for both side & of will get of what want & nbsp;but the alternative will cost job hurt economy visit hardship on million of hardworke americans & nbsp;so let set party interest aside and work to pass a budget that replace reckless cut with smart saving and wise investment in future & nbsp;and let do without the brinksmanship that stress consumer and scare off investor & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;the great nation on earth can not keep conduct business by drift from manufacture crisis to the next & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;we can not do & nbsp & nbsp let agree right here right now to keep the people ’s government open and pay bill on time and always uphold the full faith and credit of the|united|states|of|america & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;the american people have work too hard for too long rebuild from crisis to see elect official cause another & nbsp;(applause & nbsp & nbsp now most of agree that a plan to reduce the deficit must be part of agenda & nbsp;but let be clear deficit reduction alone be not an economic plan & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;a grow economy that create good middle class job that must be the|north|star that guide effort & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;every day should ask question as a nation & nbsp;how do attract more job to shore & nbsp;how do equip people with the skill need to get those job & nbsp;and how do make sure that hard work lead to a decent living?&nbsp & nbsp a|year|and|a|half|ago put forward an american jobs act that independent economist say would create more|than|1|million new job & nbsp;and thank the last congress for pass some of that agenda & nbsp;i urge this congress to pass the rest & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;but tonight will lie out additional proposal that be fully pay for and fully consistent with the budget framework both party agree to just|18|months|ago & nbsp;let repeat nothing be propose tonight should increase deficit by a single dime & nbsp;it be not a big government need but a smart government that set priority and invest in broad base growth & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;that be what should be look for.&nbsp & nbsp first priority be make america a magnet for new job and manufacturing & nbsp;after shed job for more|than|10|year manufacturer have add about|500,000 job over the|past|three & nbsp;caterpillar be bring job back from japan & nbsp;ford be bring job back from mexico & nbsp;and this|year apple will start make macs|in|america again & nbsp;(applause & nbsp there be thing can do right now to accelerate this trend & nbsp;last year create first manufacturing innovation institute in youngstown ohio & nbsp;a once shuttered warehouse be now a state of the art lab where new worker be master the 3d printing that have the potential to revolutionize the way make almost everything & nbsp;there ’s no reason this can not happen in other town & nbsp & nbsp so tonight be announce the launch of more of these manufacturing hub where business will partner with the|department|of|defense|and|energy to turn region leave behind by globalization into global center of high tech job & nbsp;and ask this congress to help create a network of of these hub and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing be make right here in america & nbsp;we can get that do & nbsp;(applause & nbsp now if want to make the good product also have to invest in the good idea & dollar invest to map the human genome return to economy every dollar & nbsp;today scientist be map the human brain to unlock the answer to alzheimer ’s & nbsp;they’re develop drug to regenerate damaged organ devise new material to make battery time more powerful & nbsp;now be not the time to gut these job create investment in science and innovation & nbsp;now be the time to reach a level of research and development not see since the height of the|space|race & nbsp;we need to make those investment & nbsp;(applause & nbsp today no area hold more promise than investment in american energy & nbsp;after year of talk about be finally poise to control own energy future & nbsp;we produce more oil at home than have in & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;we have double the distance car will go on a gallon of gas and the amount of renewable energy generate from source like wind and solar with tens|of|thousand of good american job to show for & nbsp;we produce more natural gas than ever before and nearly everyone ’s energy bill be low because of & nbsp;and over emission of the dangerous carbon pollution that threaten planet have actually fall & nbsp but for the sake of child and future must do more to combat climate change & nbsp;(applause & nbsp;now ’s true that no single event make a trend & nbsp;but the fact be the on record have all come in the|last|15 & nbsp;heat wave drought wildfire flood all be now more frequent and more intense & nbsp;we can choose to believe that superstorm|sandy and the most severe drought in decade and the bad wildfire some state have ever see be all just a freak coincidence & nbsp;or can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science and act before ’s too late & nbsp;(applause & nbsp now the good news be can make meaningful progress on this issue while drive strong economic growth & nbsp;i urge this congress to get together pursue a bipartisan market base solution to climate change like

minimum wage earn a year & nbsp;even with the tax relief put in place a family with kid that earn the minimum wage still live below the poverty line & nbsp;that ’s wrong & nbsp;that ’s why since the last time this congress raise the minimum wage state have choose to bump even higher & nbsp tonight let declare that in the wealthy nation on earth no one who work full time should have to live in poverty and raise the federal minimum wage to an hour & nbsp;(applause should be able to get that do & nbsp;(applause & nbsp this single step would raise the income of million of work family & nbsp;it could mean the difference between grocery or the food bank rent or eviction scrape by or finally get ahead & nbsp;for business across the country would mean customer with more money in pocket & nbsp;and a whole lot of folk out there would probably need less help from government & fact work folk should not have to wait year after year for the minimum wage to go up while ceo pay have never be high & nbsp;so here ’s an idea that governor romney and actually agree on last|year let tie the minimum wage to the cost of living so that finally become a wage can live on & nbsp;(applause & nbsp

both chamber be actively work on a solution.&nbsp yesterday a bipartisan group of senator announce principle for comprehensive immigration reform which be very much in line with the principle have propose and campaign on for the last few years.&nbsp so at this moment look like there ’s a genuine desire to get this do soon and that ’s very encouraging.&nbsp & nbsp but this time action must follow.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp can not allow immigration reform to get bogge down in an endless debate.&nbsp have be debate this a very long time.&nbsp so be not as if do not know technically what need to get done.&nbsp as a consequence to help move this process along today be lay out idea for immigration reform.&nbsp and hope be that this provide some key marker to member of congress as craft a bill because the idea be propose have traditionally be support by both democrats like ted|kennedy and republicans like president george|w.|bush.&nbsp do not get that matchup very often.&nbsp laughter.)&nbsp so know where the consensus should be.&nbsp & nbsp now of course there will be rigorous debate about many of the detail and every stakehold should engage in real give and take in the process.&nbsp but ’ important for to recognize that the foundation for bipartisan action be already in place.&nbsp and if congress be unable to move forward in a timely fashion will send up a bill base on proposal and insist that vote on right away.&nbsp applause & nbsp so the principle be pretty straightforward.&nbsp there be a lot of detail behind it.&nbsp be go to hand out a bunch of paper so that everybody will know exactly what be talk about.&nbsp but the principle be pretty straightforward.&nbsp & nbsp first believe need to stay focused on enforcement.&nbsp that mean continue to strengthen security at borders.&nbsp mean crack down more forcefully on business that knowingly hire undocumented workers.&nbsp to be fair most business want to do the right thing but a lot of have a hard time figure out who ’s here legally so need to implement a national system that allow business to quickly and accurately verify someone ’s employment status.&nbsp and if still knowingly hire undocumented worker then need to ramp up the penalty & nbsp second have to deal with the individual who be here illegally.&nbsp all agree that these man and woman should have to earn way to citizenship.&nbsp but for comprehensive immigration reform to work must be clear from the outset that there be a pathway to citizenship.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp & nbsp have get to lay out a path a process that include pass a background check pay taxis pay a penalty learn english and then go to the back of the line behind all the folk who be try to come here that be only fair right?&nbsp applause & nbsp so that mean will not be a quick process but will be a fair process.&nbsp and will lift these individual out of the shadow and give a chance to earn way to a green card and eventually to citizenship.&nbsp applause & nbsp and the third principle be have get to bring legal immigration system into the|21st|century because no longer reflect the reality of time.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp for example if be a citizen should not have to wait year before family be able to join in america.&nbsp should not have to wait years.&nbsp applause & nbsp if be a foreign student who want to pursue a career in science or technology or a foreign entrepreneur who want to start a business with the backing of american investor should help do that here.&nbsp because if succeed will create american business and american jobs.&nbsp will help grow will help strengthen middle class.&nbsp & nbsp so that ’s what comprehensive immigration reform look like:&nbsp smart enforcement a pathway to earn citizenship improvement in the legal immigration system so that continue to be a magnet for the good and the bright all around the world.&nbsp ’s pretty straightforward.&nbsp;&nbsp & nbsp the question now be do have the resolve as a people as a country as a government to finally put this issue behind us?&nbsp believe that do.&nbsp believe that do.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp believe be finally at a moment where comprehensive immigration reform be within grasp.&nbsp & nbsp but promise this:&nbsp the closer get the more emotional this debate be go to become.&nbsp immigration have always be an issue that enflame passions.&nbsp that ’s not surprising.&nbsp there be few thing that be more important to as a society than who get to come here and call country home who get the privilege of become a citizen of the|united|state of america.&nbsp that be a big deal & nbsp when talk about that in the abstract ’ easy sometimes for the discussion to take on a feeling of “ versus “ them.”&nbsp and when that happen a lot of folk forget that most of “ use to be them.”&nbsp forget that.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp & nbsp ’s really important for to remember history.&nbsp unless be of the first americans a native|american come from someplace else.&nbsp somebody bring you.&nbsp applause & nbsp ken|salazar descent but point that family have be live where live for so do not immigrate anywhere.&nbsp laughter.)&nbsp & nbsp the irish who leave behind a land of famine.&nbsp the germans who flee persecution.&nbsp the scandinavians who arrive eager to pioneer out west.&nbsp the polish.&nbsp the russians.&nbsp the italians.&nbsp the chinese.&nbsp the japanese.&nbsp the|west|indians.&nbsp the huddled masse who come through ellis|island on coast and angel|island on the other.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp all those folk before be be them.”&nbsp & nbsp and when each new wave of immigrant arrive face resistance from those who be already here.&nbsp face hardship.&nbsp face racism.&nbsp face ridicule.&nbsp but over time as go about daily life as earn a living as raise a family as build a community as kid go to school here do part to build a nation.&nbsp & nbsp be the einsteins and the carnegies.&nbsp but be also the million of woman and man whose name history may not remember but whose action help make who be who build this country hand by hand brick by brick.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp all come here know that what make somebody an american be not just blood or birth but allegiance to founding principle and the faith in the idea that anyone from anywhere can write the next great chapter of story & nbsp and that ’s still true today.&nbsp just ask alan|aleman.&nbsp alan be here this|afternoon where be alan?&nbsp be around here there be right here.&nbsp

hear the news that be go to offer a chance for folk like to emerge from the shadow even if be just for two|year at a time be of the first to sign and a|few|months|ago be of the first people in nevada

country to raise standard for teaching and learning the first time that ’s happen in a generation but challenge remain.&nbsp and know how to solve at a time when other country be double down on education tight budget have force state to lay off thousand of teachers.&nbsp know a good teacher can increase the lifetime income of a classroom by over|$250,000.&nbsp a great teacher can offer an escape from poverty to the child who dream beyond circumstance.&nbsp every person in this chamber can point to a teacher who change the trajectory of lives.&nbsp most teacher work tirelessly with

diploma.&nbsp when student be not allow to drop out do better.&nbsp;&nbsp;so tonight be propose that every state every state require that all student stay in high school until graduate or turn when kid do graduate the most daunting challenge can be the cost of college.&nbsp;&nbsp;at a time when americans owe more in tuition debt than credit card debt this congress need to stop the interest rate on student loan from double in july.&nbsp applause extend the tuition tax credit start that save million of middle class family thousands|of|dollar and give more young people the chance to earn way

imperative that every family in america should be able to afford let also remember that hundreds|of|thousand of talented hardworke student in this country face another challenge:&nbsp the fact that be not yet american citizens.&nbsp many be bring here as small child be american through and through yet live every day with the threat of deportation.&nbsp other come more recently to study business and science and engineering but as soon as get degree send home to invent new product and create new job somewhere else.&nbsp that do not make sense.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp believe as strongly as ever that should take on illegal immigration.&nbsp that ’s why administration have put more boot on the border than ever before.&nbsp that ’s why there be few illegal crossing than when take office.&nbsp the opponent of action be out of excuses.&nbsp should be work on comprehensive immigration reform right now.&nbsp applause but if election year politic keep congress from act on a comprehensive plan let at least agree to stop expel responsible young people who want to staff lab start new business defend this country.&nbsp send a law that give the chance to earn citizenship.&nbsp will sign right away.&nbsp applause see an economy build to last be where encourage the talent and ingenuity of every person in this country.&nbsp that mean woman should earn equal pay for equal work.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp mean should support everyone who ’s willing to work and every risk taker and entrepreneur who aspire to become the next steve|jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp after all,&nbsp;innovation be what

leave healthy one untouched.&nbsp new lightweight vest for cop and soldier that can stop any bullet.&nbsp do not gut these investment in budget.&nbsp do not let other country win the race for the future.&nbsp support the same kind of research and innovation that lead to the computer chip and the internet to new american job and new american industry and nowhere be the promise of innovation great than in american make energy.&nbsp over have open million of new acre for oil and gas exploration and&nbsp;tonight be direct administration to open more|than|75|percent of potential offshore oil and gas resources.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp right now right now american oil production be the high that ’s be in years.&nbsp that ’s right years.&nbsp;&nbsp;not only that last|year rely less on foreign oil than in any of the|past|16 years.&nbsp applause but with only|2|percent of the world ’s oil reserve oil be not enough.&nbsp this country need an all out all of the above strategy that develop every available source of american energy.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp a strategy that ’s clean cheap and full of new job have a supply of natural gas that can last america nearly years.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;and administration will take every possible action to safely develop this energy.&nbsp expert believe this will support more|than|600,000 job by the end of the decade.&nbsp and be require all company that drill for gas on public land to disclose the chemical use.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp because america will develop this resource without put the health and safety of citizen at risk the development of natural gas will create job and power truck and factory that be clean and cheap prove that do not have to choose between environment and applause.)&nbsp and by the way be public research dollar over the course of that help develop the technology to extract all this natural gas out of shale rock –- remind that government support be critical in help business get new energy idea off the ground.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp now what ’s true for natural gas be just as true for clean energy.&nbsp in three|years partnership with the private sector have already position america to be the world ’s lead manufacturer of high tech batteries.&nbsp because of federal investment renewable energy use have nearly double and thousand of americans have job because of it.&nbsp when bryan|ritterby be lay off from job make furniture say worry that at no one would give a second chance.&nbsp but find work at energetx a wind turbine manufacturer in michigan.&nbsp before the recession the factory only make luxury yachts.&nbsp today ’s hire worker like bryan who say be proud to be work in the industry of the future experience with shale gas experience with natural gas show that the payoff on these public investment do not always come right away.&nbsp some technology do not pan out some company fail.&nbsp but will not walk away from the promise of clean energy.&nbsp will not walk away from worker like bryan.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp will not cede the wind or solar or battery industry to china or germany because refuse to make the same commitment here.&nbsp have subsidize oil company for a century.&nbsp that ’s long applause.)&nbsp ’s time to end the taxpayer giveaway to an industry that rarely have be more profitable and double down on a clean energy industry that never have be more promising.&nbsp pass clean energy tax credits.&nbsp create these jobs.&nbsp applause can also spur energy innovation with new incentives.&nbsp;&nbsp;the difference in this chamber may be too deep right now to pass a comprehensive plan to fight climate there ’s no reason why congress should not at least set a clean energy standard that create a market for innovation.&nbsp so far have not acted.&nbsp;&nbsp;well tonight will.&nbsp be direct administration to allow the development of clean energy on enough public land to power homes.&nbsp and be proud to announce that the|department|of|defense work with the world ’s large consumer of energy will make of the large commitment to clean energy in history with the navy purchase enough capacity to power a|quarter|of|a|million home a year.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp of course the easy way to save money be to waste less energy.&nbsp so here ’s a proposal:&nbsp help manufacturer eliminate energy waste in factory and give business incentive to upgrade buildings.&nbsp energy bill will be low over and america will have less pollution more manufacturing more job for construction worker who need them.&nbsp send a bill that create these jobs.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp build this new energy future should be just part of a broad agenda to repair america ’s infrastructure.&nbsp so much of america need to be rebuilt.&nbsp have get crumble road and bridge a power grid that waste too much energy an incomplete high speed broadband network that prevent a small business owner in rural america from sell product all over the world.&nbsp during the|great|depression,|america build the|hoover|dam and the|golden|gate|bridge.&nbsp after

longer spend at war use half of to pay down debt and use the rest to do some nation building right here at home.&nbsp applause there ’s never be a well time to build especially since the construction industry be of the hardest hit when the housing bubble burst.&nbsp of course construction worker be not the only one who be so be million of innocent americans who have see home value decline.&nbsp and while government can not fix the problem on own responsible homeowner should not have to sit and wait for the housing market to hit bottom to get some relief.&nbsp;&nbsp and that ’s why be send this congress a plan that give every responsible homeowner the chance to save a year on mortgage by refinance at historically low rates.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp no more red tape.&nbsp no more runaround from the banks.&nbsp a small fee on the large financial institution will ensure that will not add to the deficit and will give those bank that be rescue by taxpayer a chance to repay a deficit of trust.&nbsp applause let never forget:&nbsp million of americans who work hard and play by the rule every day deserve a government and a financial system that do the same.&nbsp ’s time to apply the same rule from top to bottom.&nbsp no bailout no handout and no copouts.&nbsp an america build to last insist on responsibility from everybody.&nbsp have all pay the price for lender who sell mortgage to people who could not afford and buyer who know could not afford them.&nbsp that ’s why need smart regulation to prevent irresponsible behavior.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp rule to prevent financial fraud or toxic dumping or faulty medical device these do not destroy the free market.&nbsp make the free market work better there ’s no question that some regulation be outdate unnecessary or too costly.&nbsp in fact have approve few regulation in the|first|three|years of presidency than republican predecessor do in his.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp have order every federal agency to eliminate rule that do not make sense.&nbsp have already announce over reform and just a fraction of will save business and citizen over the|next|five years.&nbsp;we get rid of rule from that could have force some dairy farmer to spend a year prove that could contain a spill because milk be somehow classify as an oil.&nbsp with a rule like that guess be worth cry over&nbsp;spilled milk.&nbsp;(laughter and applause now be confident a farmer can contain a milk spill without a federal agency look over shoulder.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp absolutely.&nbsp but will not back down from make sure an oil company can contain the kind of oil spill see in the gulf two|year ago.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp will not back down from protect kid from mercury poisoning or make sure that food be safe and water be clean.&nbsp will not go back to the|days when health insurance company have unchecked power to cancel policy deny coverage or charge woman differently than men.&nbsp applause and will not go back to the|days when wall street be allow to play by own set of rules.&nbsp the new rule pass restore what should be any financial system ’s core purpose:&nbsp get funding to entrepreneur with the good idea and get loan to responsible family who want to buy a home or start a business or send kid to college so if be a big bank or financial institution be no longer allow to make risky bet with customer ’ be require to write out a “ living will that detail exactly how will pay the bill if fail –- because the rest of be not bail out ever again.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp and if be a mortgage lender or a payday lender or a credit card company the|days of sign people up for product can not afford with confusing form and deceptive practice those|day be over.&nbsp;&nbsp;today american consumer finally have a watchdog in richard|cordray with job:&nbsp to look out for them.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp will also establish a financial|crimes|unit of highly train investigator to crack down on large scale fraud and protect people ’s investments.&nbsp some financial firm violate major anti - fraud law because there ’s no real penalty for be a repeat offender.&nbsp that ’s bad for consumer and ’ bad for the vast majority of banker and financial service professional who do the right thing.&nbsp so pass legislation that make the penalty for fraud count.&nbsp and tonight be ask attorney general to create a special unit of federal prosecutor and lead state attorney general to expand investigation into the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgage that lead to the housing crisis.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp this new unit will hold accountable those who break the law speed assistance to homeowner and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so|many|americans.&nbsp now a return to the american value of fair play and share responsibility will help protect people and but should also guide as look to pay down debt and invest in future right now most immediate priority be stop a tax hike on work americans while the recovery be still applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;people can not afford lose out of each paycheck this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;there be plenty of way to get this done.&nbsp so let agree right here right now:&nbsp no side issues.&nbsp no drama.&nbsp;&nbsp;pass the payroll tax cut without delay.&nbsp let get done.&nbsp;&nbsp;(applause when come to the deficit have already agree to more|than|$2|trillion in cut and savings.&nbsp but need to do more and that mean make choices.&nbsp right now be poise to spend nearly|$1|trillion more on what be suppose to be a temporary tax break for the wealthy of americans.&nbsp right now because of loophole and shelter in the tax code a|quarter of all millionaire pay low tax rate than million of middle class households.&nbsp right now warren|buffett pay a low tax rate than secretary.&nbsp;&nbsp do want to keep these tax cut for the wealthy americans?&nbsp or do want to keep investment in everything else –- like education and medical research a strong military and care for veterans?&nbsp because if be serious about pay down debt can not do both.&nbsp;&nbsp the american people know what the right choice is.&nbsp so do i.&nbsp as tell the speaker this|summer be prepare to make more reform that rein in the long term cost of medicare and medicaid and strengthen social|security so long as those program remain a guarantee of security for seniors.&nbsp but in return need to change tax code so that people like and an awful lot of member of congress pay fair share of taxes.&nbsp applause tax reform should follow the buffett|rule.&nbsp if make more|than|$1|million a year should not pay less|than|30|percent in taxes.&nbsp and republican friend tom|coburn be right:&nbsp washington should stop subsidize millionaires.&nbsp in fact if be earn a|million|dollars a year should not get special tax subsidy or deductions.&nbsp on the other hand if make under a year like of american family taxis should not go up.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp be the one struggle with rise cost and stagnant wages.&nbsp be the one who need now can call this class warfare all want.&nbsp but ask a billionaire to pay at least as much as secretary in taxes?&nbsp most americans would call that common sense.&nbsp do not begrudge financial success in this country.&nbsp admire it.&nbsp when americans talk about folk like pay fair share of taxis ’s not because envy the rich.&nbsp ’s because understand that when get a tax break do not need and the country can not afford either add to the deficit or somebody else have to make up the difference like a senior on a fixed income or a student try to get through school or a family try to make end meet.&nbsp that ’s not right.&nbsp americans know that ’s not right.&nbsp know that this generation ’s success be only possible because past generation feel a responsibility to each other and to the future of country and know way of life will only endure if feel that same sense of share responsibility.&nbsp that ’s how will reduce deficit.&nbsp that’s|an|america build to last.&nbsp applause now recognize that people watch tonight have differ view about taxis and debt energy and health care.&nbsp but no matter what party belong to bet most americans be think the same thing right about now:&nbsp nothing will get do in washington this|year or next|year or maybe even the|year after that because washington be break can blame for feel a little cynical?&nbsp the great blow to confidence in economy last|year do not come from event beyond control.&nbsp come from a debate in washington over whether the|united|states would pay bill or not.&nbsp who benefit from that fiasco have talk tonight about the deficit of trust between main|street and wall street.&nbsp but the divide between this city and the rest of the country be at least as bad and seem to get bad every|year some of this have to do with the corrosive influence of money in politics.&nbsp so together let take some step to fix that.&nbsp;&nbsp;send a bill that ban insider trading by member of congress will sign tomorrow.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp let limit any elect official from own stock in industry impact.&nbsp let make sure people who bundle campaign contribution for congress can not lobby congress and vice versa an idea that have bipartisan support at least outside of washington.&nbsp some of what ’s break have to do with the way congress do business these days.&nbsp a simple majority be no longer enough to get anything even routine business –- pass through the senate.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp neither party have be blameless in these tactics.&nbsp now both party should put an end to it.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;for starter ask the senate to pass a simple rule that all judicial and public service nomination receive a simple up or down vote within days.&nbsp;(applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp the executive branch also need to change.&nbsp too often ’s inefficient outdated and remote.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp that ’s why have ask this congress to grant the authority to consolidate the federal bureaucracy so that government be lean quick and more responsive to the need of the american people.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp finally none of this can happen unless also lower the temperature in this town.&nbsp need to end the notion that the party must be lock in a perpetual campaign of mutual destruction that politics be about cling to rigid ideology instead of build consensus around common sense ideas.&nbsp be a democrat.&nbsp;&nbsp;but believe what republican abraham|lincoln believed:&nbsp that government should do for people only what can not do better by and no more.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp that ’s why education reform offer more competition and more control for school and states.&nbsp that ’s why be get rid of regulation that do not work.&nbsp that ’s why health care law rely on a reformed private market not a government program.&nbsp on the other hand even republican friend who complain the most about government spending have support federally finance road and clean energy project and federal office for the folk back home.&nbsp the point be should all want a smart more effective government.&nbsp and while may not be able to bridge big philosophical difference this|year can make real progress.&nbsp with or without this congress will keep take action that help the economy grow.&nbsp but can do a whole lot more with help.&nbsp because when act together there ’s nothing can not achieve.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp that ’s the lesson have learn from action abroad over the|last|few|year end the iraq war have allow to strike decisive blow against enemies.&nbsp from pakistan to yemen the al|qaeda operative who remain be scramble know that can not escape the reach of the|united|state of america.&nbsp applause from this position of strength have begin to wind down the war in afghanistan.&nbsp ten|thousand of troop have come home.&nbsp three|thousand more will

applause.)&nbsp & nbsp the agreement pass in july will cut government spending by about|$1|trillion over the|next|10 years.&nbsp also charge this congress to come up with an|additional|$1.5|trillion in saving by christmas.&nbsp tonight be ask to increase that amount so that cover the full cost of the american jobs|act.&nbsp and a|week|from|monday will be release a more ambitious deficit plan a plan that will not only cover the cost of this job bill but stabilize debt in the long run.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp this approach be basically the one have be advocate for months.&nbsp in addition to the|trillion|dollars of spending cut have already sign into law ’ a balanced plan that would reduce the deficit by make additional spending cut by make modest adjustment to health care program like medicare and medicaid and by reform tax code in a way that ask the wealthy americans and big corporation to pay fair share.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp what ’s more the spending cut would not happen so abruptly that would be a drag on economy or prevent from help small business and middle class family get back on foot right away.&nbsp;&nbsp now realize there be some in party who do not think should make any change at all to medicare and medicaid and understand concerns.&nbsp but here ’s the truth:&nbsp million of americans rely on medicare in retirement.&nbsp and million more will do so in the future.&nbsp pay for this benefit during work years.&nbsp earn but with an age population and rise health care cost be spend too fast to sustain the program.&nbsp and if do not gradually reform the system while protect current beneficiary will not be there when future retiree need it.&nbsp have to reform medicare to strengthen applause.)&nbsp be also be also well aware that there be many republicans who do not believe should raise taxis on those who be most fortunate and can best afford it.&nbsp but here be what every american knows:&nbsp while most people in this country struggle to make end meet a few of the most affluent citizen and most profitable corporation enjoy tax break and loophole that nobody else gets.&nbsp right now warren|buffett pay a low tax rate than secretary an outrage have ask to fix.&nbsp laughter.)&nbsp need a tax code where everyone get a fair shake and where everybody pay fair share.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp and by the way believe the vast majority of

give an advantage to company that can afford the best connect lobbyists.&nbsp should give an advantage to company that invest and create job right here in the|united|state of america.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp so can reduce this deficit pay down debt and pay for this job plan in the process.&nbsp but in order to do this have to decide what priority are.&nbsp have to ask what ’s the good way to grow the economy and create job should keep tax loophole for oil companies?&nbsp or should use that money to give small business owner a tax credit when hire new workers?&nbsp because can not afford to do both.&nbsp should keep tax break for millionaire and billionaires?&nbsp or should put teacher back to work so kid can graduate ready for college and good jobs?&nbsp applause.)&nbsp right now can not afford to do both.&nbsp;&nbsp this be not political grandstanding.&nbsp this be not class warfare.&nbsp this be simple math.&nbsp laughter.)&nbsp this be simple math.&nbsp these be real choices.&nbsp these be real choice that have get to make.&nbsp and be pretty sure know what most americans would choose.&nbsp ’s not even close.&nbsp and ’s time for to do

right now.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp be also plan to cut away the red tape that prevent too many rapidly grow startup company from raise capital and go public.&nbsp and to help responsible homeowner be go to work with federal housing agency to help more people refinance mortgage at interest rate that be now near that ’s a step applause know guy must be for this because that ’s a step that can put more|than|$2,000 a year in a family ’s pocket and give a lift to an economy still burden by the drop in housing prices.&nbsp so some thing can do on own.&nbsp other step will require congressional action.&nbsp today pass reform that will speed up the outdated patent process so that entrepreneur can turn a new idea into a new business as quickly as possible that ’s the kind of action need.&nbsp now ’s time to clear the way for a series of trade agreement that would make easy for american company to sell product in panama and colombia and south|korea while also help the worker whose job have

product sell around the world stamp with the proud words:&nbsp “ make in america.”&nbsp that ’s what need to get done.&nbsp applause and on all of effort to strengthen competitiveness need to look for

sell all around the world.&nbsp that ’s how america can be number again.&nbsp and that’s|how|america will be number again.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp now realize that some of have a different theory on how to grow the economy.&nbsp some of sincerely believe that the only solution to economic challenge be to simply cut most government spending and eliminate most government regulations.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp & nbsp well agree that can not afford wasteful spending and will work with with congress to root out.&nbsp and agree that there be some rule and regulation that do put an unnecessary burden on business at a time when can least afford it.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp that ’s why order a review of all government regulations.&nbsp so far have identify over reform which will save billions|of|dollar over the|next|few years.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp should have no more regulation than the health safety and security of the american people require.&nbsp every rule should meet that common sense test.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp but what can not do what will not do be let this economic crisis be use as an excuse to wipe out the basic protection that americans have count on for

credit card company or rule that keep kid from be expose to mercury or law that prevent the health insurance industry from shortchange patients.&nbsp reject the idea that have to strip away collective bargaining right to compete in a global economy.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp should not be in a race to the bottom where try to offer the cheap labor and the bad pollution standards.&nbsp america should be in a race to the top.&nbsp and believe can win that race.&nbsp applause in fact this large notion that the only thing can do to restore prosperity be just dismantle government refund everybody ’s

bless and god bless the|united|state of america.&nbsp applause view transcript transcript good evening.&nbsp nearly|10|years|ago america suffer the bad attack on shore since this mass murder be plan by osama|bin|laden and al|qaeda network in afghanistan and signal a new threat to security –- in which the target be no long soldier on a battlefield but innocent man woman and child go about daily lives.&nbsp in the|day that follow nation be unite as strike at al|qaeda and route the taliban in afghanistan.&nbsp then focus shifted.&nbsp a second war be launch in iraq and spend enormous blood and treasure to support a new government there.&nbsp by the time take office the war in afghanistan have enter seventh year.&nbsp but al|qaeda ’s leader have escape into pakistan and be plot new attack while the taliban have regroup and go on the offensive.&nbsp without a new strategy and decisive action military commander warn that could face a resurgent al|qaeda and a taliban take over large part of afghanistan for this reason in of the most difficult decision that have make as president order an|additional|30,000 american troop into afghanistan.&nbsp when announce this surge at west|point set clear objectives:&nbsp to refocus on al|qaeda to reverse the taliban ’s momentum and train afghan security force to defend own country.&nbsp also make clear that commitment would not be open ended and that would begin to draw down force tonight can tell that be fulfil that commitment.&nbsp thank to extraordinary man and woman in uniform civilian personnel and many coalition partner be meet goals.&nbsp as a result start next|month will be able to remove of troop from afghanistan by and will bring home a total of troop by next|summer fully recover the surge announce at west|point.&nbsp after this initial reduction troop will continue come home at a steady pace as afghan security force move into the lead.&nbsp mission will change from combat to support.&nbsp by this process of transition will be complete and the afghan people will be responsible for own security.&nbsp be start this drawdown from a position of strength.&nbsp al|qaeda be under more pressure than at any time since together with the pakistanis have take out more|than|half of al|qaeda ’s leadership.&nbsp and thank to intelligence professional and special|force kill osama|bin|laden the only leader that al|qaeda have ever known.&nbsp this be a victory for all who have serve since soldier sum up well.&nbsp “ the message say “ be do not forget.&nbsp will be hold accountable no matter how long takes.”&nbsp the information that recover from bin|laden ’s compound show al|qaeda under enormous strain.&nbsp bin|laden express concern that al|qaeda have be unable to effectively replace senior terrorist that have be kill and that al|qaeda have fail in effort to portray america as a nation at war with islam thereby drain more widespread support.&nbsp al|qaeda remain dangerous and must be vigilant against attacks.&nbsp but have put al|qaeda on a path to defeat and will not relent until the job be do in afghanistan have inflict serious loss on the taliban and take a number of strongholds.&nbsp along with surge ally also increase commitment which help stabilize more of the country.&nbsp afghan security force have grow by over troop and in some province and municipality have already begin to transition responsibility for security to the afghan people.&nbsp in the face of violence and intimidation afghans be fight and die for country establish local police force open market and school create new opportunity for woman and girl and try to turn the page on decade of war of course huge challenge remain.&nbsp this be the beginning but not the end –- of effort to wind down this war.&nbsp will have to do the hard work of keep the gain that have make while draw down force and transition responsibility for security to the afghan government.&nbsp and next|may in chicago will host a summit with nato ally and partner to shape the next phase of this transition do know that peace can not come to a land that have know so much war without a political settlement.&nbsp so as strengthen the afghan government and security force america will join initiative that reconcile the afghan people include the taliban.&nbsp position on these talk be clear:&nbsp must be lead by the afghan government and those who want to be a part of a peaceful afghanistan must break from al|qaeda abandon violence and abide by the afghan constitution.&nbsp but in part because of military effort have reason to believe that progress can be make the goal that seek be achievable and can be express simply:&nbsp no safe haven from which al|qaeda or affiliate can launch attack against homeland or allies.&nbsp will not try to make afghanistan a perfect place.&nbsp will not police street or patrol mountain indefinitely.&nbsp that be the responsibility of the afghan government which must step up ability to protect people and move from an economy shape by war to that can sustain a last peace.&nbsp what can do and will do be build a partnership with the afghan people that endure –- that ensure that will be able to continue target terrorist and support a sovereign afghan government of course effort must also address terrorist safe haven in pakistan.&nbsp no country be more endanger by the presence of violent extremist which be why will continue to press pakistan to expand participation in secure a more peaceful future for this war tear region.&nbsp will work with the pakistani government to root out the cancer of violent extremism and will insist that keep commitments.&nbsp for there should be no doubt that so long as be president the|united|states will never tolerate a safe haven for those who aim to kill us.&nbsp can not elude nor escape the justice deserve.&nbsp fellow americans this have be a difficult decade for country.&nbsp have learn anew the profound cost of war a cost that be be pay by the nearly americans who have give life in iraq and the over who have do so in afghanistan man and woman who will not live to enjoy the freedom that

afghanistan the light of a secure peace can be see in the distance.&nbsp these long war will come to a responsible end as do must learn lessons.&nbsp already this|decade of war have cause many to question the nature of america ’s engagement around the world.&nbsp some would have america retreat from responsibility as an anchor of global security and embrace an isolation that ignore the very real threat that face.&nbsp other would have america over extended confront every evil that can be find abroad must chart a more centered course.&nbsp like generation before must embrace america ’s singular role in the course of human events.&nbsp but must be as pragmatic as be passionate as strategic as be resolute.&nbsp when threaten must respond with force –- but when that force can be target need not deploy large army overseas.&nbsp when innocent be be slaughter and global security endanger do not have to choose between stand idly by or act on own.&nbsp instead must rally international action which be do in libya where do not have a single soldier on the ground but be support ally in protect the libyan people and give the chance to determine own destiny in all that do must remember

nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;together have meet great challenges.&nbsp but as enter this new chapter in shared history profound challenge stretch before us.&nbsp in a world where the prosperity of all nation be now inextricably link a new era of cooperation be require to ensure the growth and stability of the global economy.&nbsp as new threat spread across border and ocean must dismantle terrorist network and stop the spread of nuclear weapon confront climate change and combat famine and disease.&nbsp and as a revolution race through the street of the|middle|east and north|africa the entire world have a stake in the aspiration of a generation that long to determine own destiny.&nbsp & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these challenge come at a time when the international order have already be reshape for a new century.&nbsp country like china india and brazil be grow by leap and bounds.&nbsp should welcome this development for have lift hundreds|of|million from poverty around the globe and create new market and opportunity for own nation & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and yet as this rapid change have take place ’s become fashionable in some|quarters to question whether the rise of these nation will accompany the decline of american and european influence around the world.&nbsp perhaps the argument go these nation represent the future and the time for leadership have passed.&nbsp & argument be wrong.&nbsp the time for leadership be now be the|united|state and and democratic ally that shape a world in which new nation could emerge and individual could and even as more nation take on the responsibility of global leadership alliance will remain indispensable to the goal of a|century that be more peaceful more prosperous and more just & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at a time when threat and challenge require nation to work in concert with one another remain the great catalyst for global action.&nbsp in an|era define by the rapid flow of commerce and information be free market tradition openness fortify by commitment to basic security for citizen that offer the good chance of prosperity that be both strong and shared.&nbsp as|million be still deny basic human right because of who be or what believe or the kind of government that live under be the nation most willing to stand up for the value of tolerance and self determination that lead to peace and dignity.&nbsp & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now this do not mean can afford to stand still.&nbsp the nature of leadership will need to change with the times.&nbsp as say the first time come to london as president for the g20 summit the day be go when roosevelt and churchill could sit in a room and solve the world ’s problem over a glass of although be sure that prime minister cameron would agree that some|day could both use a stiff drink.&nbsp laughter.)&nbsp in this|century joint leadership will require build new partnership adapt to new circumstance and remake to meet the demand of a new era.&nbsp & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that begin with economic leadership.&nbsp & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adam smith ’s central insight remain true today:&nbsp there be no great generator of wealth and innovation than a system of free enterprise that unleash the full potential of individual man and women.&nbsp that ’s what lead to the|industrial|revolution that begin in the factory of manchester.&nbsp that be what lead to the dawn of the information age that arise from the office park of silicon valley.&nbsp that ’s why country like china india and brazil be grow so rapidly because in fit and start be move toward market base principle that the|united|states and have always embraced.&nbsp & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in other word live in a global economy that be largely of own making.&nbsp and today the competition for the good job and industry favor country that be free thinking and forward look country with the most creative and innovative and entrepreneurial citizens.&nbsp & give nation like the|united|state and an inherent advantage.&nbsp for from newton and darwin to edison|and|einstein from alan|ture to steve|job have lead the world in commitment to science and cutting edge research the discovery of new medicine and technologies.&nbsp educate citizen and train worker in the good college and university on earth.&nbsp but to maintain this advantage in a world that ’s more competitive than ever will have to redouble investment in science and engineering and renew national commitment to educate workforces.&nbsp & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we’ve also be remind in the|last|few|year that market can sometimes fail.&nbsp in the|last|century both nation put in place regulatory framework to deal with such market failure safeguard to protect the banking system after the|great|depression for example regulation that be establish to prevent the pollution of air and water during the & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but in today ’s economy such threat of market failure can no longer be contain within the border of any country.&nbsp market failure can go global and go viral and demand international responses.&nbsp & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a financial crisis that begin on wall street infect nearly every continent which be why must keep work through forum like the g20 to put in place global rule of the road to prevent future excess and abuse.&nbsp no country can hide from the danger of carbon pollution which be why must build on what be achieve at copenhagen and cancun to leave child a planet that be safe and cleaner.&nbsp & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moreover even when the free market work as should both country recognize that no matter how responsibly live in life hard time or bad luck a crippling illness or a layoff may strike any of us.&nbsp and so part of common tradition have express in a conviction that every citizen deserve a basic measure of security health care if get sick unemployment insurance if lose job a dignified retirement after a lifetime of hard work.&nbsp that commitment to citizen have also be the reason for leadership in the world.&nbsp & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and now have come through a terrible recession challenge be to meet these obligation while ensure that be not consume and hence consume with a level of debt that could sap the strength and vitality of and that will require difficult choice and will require different path for both of countries.&nbsp but have face such challenge before and have always be able to balance the need for fiscal responsibility with the responsibility have to another.&nbsp & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and believe can do this again.&nbsp as do the success and failure of own past can serve as an example for emerge economy that ’ possible to grow without pollute that last prosperity come not from what a nation consume but from what produce and from the investment make in people and infrastructure.&nbsp & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and just as must lead on behalf of the prosperity of citizen so must safeguard security.&nbsp nation know what be to confront evil in the world.&nbsp hitler ’s army would not have stop killing have not fight on the beach and on the landing ground in the field and on the streets.&nbsp must never forget that there be nothing inevitable about victory in that terrible war.&nbsp be win through the courage and character of people & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;precisely because be willing to bear burden know well the cost of war.&nbsp and that be why build an alliance that be strong enough to defend this continent while deter enemies.&nbsp at core nato be root in the simple concept of article|five:&nbsp that no nato nation will have to fend on own that ally will stand by another always.&nbsp and for six|decade nato have be the most successful alliance in human history & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;today confront a different enemy.&nbsp terrorist have take the life of citizen in new|york and in london.&nbsp and while al|qaeda seek a religious war with the west must remember that have kill thousand of muslims man woman and child around the globe.&nbsp nation be not and will never be at war with islam.&nbsp fight be focus on defeat al|qaeda and extremist allies.&nbsp in that effort will not relent as osama|bin|laden and follower have learned.&nbsp and as fight an enemy that respect no law of war will continue to hold to a high standard by live up to the value the rule of law and due process that so ardently defend & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for almost|a|decade afghanistan have be a central front of these efforts.&nbsp throughout those|year the british people have be a stalwart ally along with so many other who fight by side.&nbsp & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;together let pay tribute to all of man and woman who have serve and sacrifice over for be part of an unbroken line of hero who have bear the heavy burden for the freedom that enjoy.&nbsp because of have break the taliban ’s momentum.&nbsp because of have build the capacity of afghan security forces.&nbsp and because of be now prepare to turn a corner in afghanistan by transition to afghan and during this transition will pursue a lasting peace with those who break free of al|qaeda and respect the afghan constitution and lie down arms.&nbsp and will ensure that afghanistan be never a safe haven for terror but be instead a country that be strong sovereign and able to stand on own two|feet & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indeed effort in this|young|century have lead to a new concept for nato that will give the capability need to meet new threat threat like terrorism and piracy cyber attack and ballistic missiles.&nbsp but a revitalize nato will continue to hew to that original vision of founder allow to rally collective action for the defense of people while build upon the broad belief of roosevelt and churchill that all nation have both right and responsibility and all nation share a common interest in an international architecture that maintain the peace & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we also share a common interest in stop the spread of nuclear weapons.&nbsp across the globe nation be lock down nuclear material so never fall into the wrong hand because of leadership.&nbsp from north|korea to iran have send a message that those who flaunt obligation will face consequence which be why america and the|european|union just recently strengthen sanction on iran in large part because of the leadership of the|united|kingdom and the|united|states.&nbsp and while hold other to account will meet own obligation under the|non proliferation|treaty and strive for a world without nuclear weapon & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we share a common interest in resolve conflict that prolong human suffering and threaten to tear whole region asunder.&nbsp in sudan after year of war and thousand of death call on both north|and|south to pull back from the brink of violence and choose the path of peace.&nbsp and in the|middle|east stand united in support for a secure israel and a sovereign palestine & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and share a common interest in development that advance dignity and security.&nbsp to succeed must cast aside the impulse to look at impoverished part of the globe as a place for charity.&nbsp instead should empower the same force that have allow own people to thrive:&nbsp should help the hungry to feed the doctor who care for the sick.&nbsp should support country that confront corruption and allow people to innovate.&nbsp and should advance the truth that nation prosper when allow woman and girl to reach full potential & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we do these thing because believe not simply in the right of nation believe in the right of citizens.&nbsp that be the beacon that guide through fight against fascism and twilight struggle against communism.&nbsp and today that idea be be put to the test in the|middle|east and north|africa.&nbsp in country after country people be mobilize to free from the grip of an iron fist.&nbsp and while these movement for change be just|six|months|old have see play out before from to the americas from south|africa to southeast|asia & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;history tell that democracy be not easy.&nbsp will be year before these revolution reach conclusion and there will be difficult day along the way.&nbsp power rarely give up without a fight particularly in place where there be division of tribe and division of sect.&nbsp also know that populism can take dangerous turn from the extremism of those who would use democracy to deny minority right to the nationalism that leave so many scar on this continent in the|20th|century & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but make no mistake:&nbsp what see what be see in tehran in tunis in tahrir|square be a longing for the same freedom that take for grant here at home.&nbsp be a rejection of the notion that people in certain part of the world do not want to be free or need to have democracy impose upon them.&nbsp be a rebuke to the worldview of al|qaeda which smother the right of individual and would thereby subject to perpetual poverty and violence.&nbsp & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let there be no doubt:&nbsp the|united|state and united|kingdom stand squarely on the side of those who long to be free.&nbsp and now must show that will back up those word with deeds.&nbsp that mean invest in the future of those nation that transition to democracy start with tunisia and egypt by deepen tie of trade and commerce by help demonstrate that freedom bring prosperity.&nbsp and that mean stand up for universal right by sanction those who pursue repression strengthen civil society support the right of minorities.&nbsp & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we do this know that the west must overcome suspicion and mistrust among many in the|middle|east and north|africa a mistrust that be root in a difficult past.&nbsp for year have face charge of hypocrisy from those who do not enjoy the freedom that hear espouse.&nbsp and so to must squarely acknowledge that yes have endure interest in the region to fight terror sometimes with partner who may not be perfect to protect against disruption of the world ’s energy supply.&nbsp but must also insist that reject as false the choice between interest and ideal between stability and democracy.&nbsp for idealism be root in the reality of history that repression offer only the false promise of stability that society be more successful when citizen be free and that democracy be the close ally have & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it be that truth that guide action in libya.&nbsp would have be easy at the outset of the crackdown in libya to say that none of this be business that a nation ’s sovereignty be more important than the slaughter of civilian within borders.&nbsp that argument carry weight with some.&nbsp but be embrace a broad responsibility.&nbsp and while can not stop every injustice there be circumstance that cut through caution when a leader be threaten to massacre people and the international community be call for action.&nbsp that ’s why stop a massacre in libya.&nbsp and will not relent until the people of libya be protect and the shadow of tyranny be lift & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we will proceed with humility and the knowledge that can not dictate every outcome ultimately freedom must be win by the people not impose from without.&nbsp but can and must stand with those who so struggle.&nbsp because have always believe that the future of child and grandchild will be well if other people ’s child and grandchild be more prosperous and more free from the beach of normandy to the balkans to benghazi.&nbsp that be interest and ideals.&nbsp and if fail to meet that responsibility who would take place and what kind of world would pass on & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our action leadership be essential to the cause of human dignity.&nbsp and so must act and lead with confidence in ideal and an abide faith in the character of people who send all here today.&nbsp & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for there be final quality that believe make the|united|states and the united|kingdom indispensable to this moment in history.&nbsp and that be how define as & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unlike most country in the world do not define citizenship base on race or ethnicity.&nbsp be american or british be not about belong to a certain group ’s about believe in a certain set of ideal the right of individual the rule of law.&nbsp that be why hold incredible diversity within borders.&nbsp that ’s why there be people around the world right now who believe that if come to america if come to new|york if come to london if work hard can pledge allegiance to flag and call americans if come to england can make a new life for and can sing god save the queen just like any other citizen & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yes diversity can lead to and throughout history there have be heat debate about immigration and assimilation in both of countries.&nbsp but even as these debate can be difficult fundamentally recognize that patchwork heritage be an enormous strength that in a world which will only grow small and more interconnected the example of nation say be possible for people to be unite by ideal instead of divide by difference that ’ possible for heart to change and old hatred to pass that ’ possible for the son and daughter of former colony to sit here as member of this great parliament and for the grandson of a kenyan who serve as a cook in the|british|army to stand before as president of the united states.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that be what define us.&nbsp that be why the young man and woman in the street of damascus and cairo still reach for the right citizen enjoy even if sometimes differ with policies.&nbsp as of the most powerful nation in the history of the world must always remember that the true source of influence have not just be the size of economy or the reach of military or the land that have claimed.&nbsp have be the value that must never waver in defend around the world the idea that all being be endow by creator with certain right that can not be denied.&nbsp & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that be what forge bond in the fire of war a bond make manifest by the friendship between|two of great leaders.&nbsp churchill and roosevelt have differences.&nbsp be keen observer of each other ’s blind spot and shortcoming if not always own and be hard headed about ability to remake the world.&nbsp but what join the fate of these man at that particular moment in history be not simply a share interest in victory on the battlefield.&nbsp be a share belief in the ultimate triumph of human freedom and human dignity a conviction that have a say in how this story ends.&nbsp & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this conviction live on in people today.&nbsp the challenge face be great.&nbsp the work before be hard.&nbsp but have come through a|difficult|decade and whenever the test and trial ahead may seem too big or too many let turn to example and the word that churchill speak on the|day that europe be free & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“in the|long|years to come not only will the people of this island but … the world wherever the bird of freedom chirps in the human heart look back to what have do and will say do not despair do not yield … straightforward & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with courage and purpose with humility and with hope with faith in the promise of tomorrow let march straightforward together endure ally in the cause of a world that be more peaceful more prosperous and more just.&nbsp & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thank very much.&nbsp applause view transcript transcript thank you.&nbsp thank you.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp thank very much.&nbsp thank you.&nbsp please have a seat.&nbsp thank very much.&nbsp want to begin by thank hillary|clinton who have travel so much these|last|six|month that be approach a new landmark one|million frequent flyer miles.&nbsp laughter.)&nbsp count on hillary every single day and believe that will go down as of the fine secretaries|of|state in nation ’s history the|state|department be a fitting venue to mark a new chapter in american diplomacy.&nbsp for six|month have witness an extraordinary change take place in the|middle|east and north|africa.&nbsp square by square town by town country by country the people have rise up to demand basic human rights.&nbsp leader have step aside.&nbsp more may follow.&nbsp and though these country may be a great distance from shore know that own future be bind to this region by the force of economic and security by history and by faith today want to talk about this change the force that be drive and how can respond in a way that advance value and strengthen security now already have do much to shift foreign policy follow a|decade define by costly conflicts.&nbsp after year of war in iraq have remove american troop and end combat mission there.&nbsp in afghanistan have break the taliban ’s momentum and will begin to bring troop home and continue a transition to afghan and after year of war against al|qaeda and affiliate have deal al|qaeda a huge blow by kill leader osama|bin|laden bin|laden be no martyr.&nbsp be a mass murderer who offer a message of hate –- an insistence that muslims have to take up arm against the west and that violence against man woman and child be the only path to change.&nbsp reject democracy and individual right for muslims in favor of violent extremism agenda focus on what could destroy not what could build bin|laden and murderous vision win some adherents.&nbsp but even before death al|qaeda be lose struggle for relevance as the overwhelming majority of people see that the slaughter of innocent do not answer cry for a well life.&nbsp by the time find bin|laden al|qaeda ’s agenda have come to be see by the vast majority of the region as a dead end and the people of the|middle|east and north|africa have take future into own hand that story of self determination begin six|months|ago in tunisia.&nbsp on december|17th a young vendor name mohammed|bouazizi be devastate when a police officer confiscate cart.&nbsp this be not unique.&nbsp ’s the same kind of humiliation that take place every|day in many part of the world the relentless tyranny of government that deny citizen dignity.&nbsp only this time something different happened.&nbsp after local official refuse to hear complaint this young man who have never be particularly active in politic go to the headquarters of the provincial government douse in fuel and light on fire there be time in the course of history when the action of ordinary citizen spark movement for change because speak to a longing for freedom that have be build up for years.&nbsp in america think of the defiance of those patriot in boston who refuse to pay taxis to a king or the dignity of rosa|park as sit courageously in seat.&nbsp so be in tunisia as that vendor ’s act of desperation tap into the frustration feel throughout the country.&nbsp hundred of protester take to the street then and in the face of baton and sometimes bullet refuse to go home –-|day|after|day week after week until a dictator of more|than|two|decade finally leave power the story of this revolution and the one that follow should not have come as a surprise.&nbsp the nation of the|middle|east and north|africa win independence long ago but in too many place people do not.&nbsp in too many country power have be concentrate in the hand of a few.&nbsp in too many country a citizen like that young vendor have nowhere to no honest judiciary to hear case no independent medium to give voice no credible political party to represent view no free and fair election where could choose leader and this lack of self determination –- the chance to make life what will –- have apply to the region ’s economy as well.&nbsp yes some nation be bless with wealth in oil and gas and that have lead to pocket of prosperity.&nbsp but in a global economy base on knowledge base on innovation no development strategy can be base solely upon what come out of the ground nor can people reach potential when can not start a business without pay a bribe in the face of these challenge too many leader in the region try to direct people ’s grievance elsewhere.&nbsp the west be blame as the source of all ill a|half century after the end of colonialism.&nbsp antagonism toward israel become the only acceptable outlet for political expression.&nbsp division of tribe ethnicity and religious sect be manipulate as a means of hold on to power or take away from somebody else but the event of the|past|six|month show that strategy of repression and strategy of diversion will not work anymore.&nbsp satellite television and the internet provide a window into the wide world a world of astonishing progress in place like india and indonesia and brazil.&nbsp cell phone and social network allow young people to connect and organize like never before.&nbsp and so a new generation have emerged.&nbsp and voice tell that change can not be deny in cairo hear the voice of the young mother who say ’s like can finally breathe fresh air for the first time.”&nbsp in sanaa hear the student who chant the night must come to an end in benghazi hear the engineer who say word be free now.&nbsp ’ a feeling can not explain in damascus hear the young man who say after the first yelling the first shout feel dignity.”&nbsp those shout of human dignity be be hear across the region.&nbsp and through the moral force of nonviolence the people of the region have achieve more change in six|month than terrorist have accomplish in decade of course change of this magnitude do not come easily.&nbsp in our|day and age a time of 24-hour news cycle and constant communication –- people expect the transformation of the region to be resolve in a matter of weeks.&nbsp but will be year before this story reach end.&nbsp along the way there will be good day and there will bad days.&nbsp in some place change will be swift in other gradual.&nbsp and as have already see call for change may give way in some case to fierce contest for power the question before be what role america will play as this story unfolds.&nbsp for decade the|united|state have pursue a set of core interest in the region:&nbsp counter terrorism and stop the spread of nuclear weapon secure the free flow of commerce and safe guard the security of the region stand up for israel ’s security and pursue arab israeli peace will continue to do these thing with the firm belief that america ’s interest be not hostile to people ’s hope be essential to them.&nbsp believe that no one benefit from a nuclear arm race in the region or al|qaeda ’s brutal attacks.&nbsp believe people everywhere would see economy cripple by a cut off in energy supplies.&nbsp as do in will not tolerate aggression across border and will keep commitment to friend and partner yet must acknowledge that a strategy base solely upon the narrow pursuit of these interest will not fill an empty stomach or allow someone to speak mind.&nbsp moreover failure to speak to the broad aspiration of ordinary people will only feed the suspicion that have fester for year that the|united|stat pursue interest at expense.&nbsp give that this mistrust run both way –- as americans have be sear by hostage taking and violent rhetoric and terrorist attack that have kill thousand of citizen a failure to change approach threaten a deepen spiral of division between the|united|state and the arab world and that ’s why two|years|ago in cairo begin to broaden engagement base upon mutual interest and mutual respect.&nbsp believe then and believe now that have a stake not just in the stability of nation but in the self determination of individuals.&nbsp the status quo be not sustainable.&nbsp society hold together by fear and repression may offer the illusion of stability for a time but be build upon fault line that will eventually tear asunder so face a historic opportunity.&nbsp have the chance to show that america value the dignity of the street vendor in tunisia more than the raw power of the dictator.&nbsp there must be no doubt that the|united|states|of|america welcome change that advance self determination and opportunity.&nbsp yes there will be peril that accompany this moment of promise.&nbsp but after decade of accept the world as be in the region have a chance to pursue the world as should be of course as do must proceed with a sense of humility.&nbsp ’s not america that put people into the street of tunis or cairo be the people who launch these movement and ’s the people that must ultimately determine outcome.&nbsp not every country will follow particular form of representative democracy and there will be time when short term interest do not align perfectly with long term vision for the region.&nbsp but can and will speak out for a set of core principle –- principle that have guide response to the event over the|past|six|month the|united|states oppose the use of violence and repression against the people of the region.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp the|united|states support a set of universal rights.&nbsp and these right include free speech the freedom of peaceful assembly the freedom of religion equality for man and woman under the rule of law and the right to choose own whether live in baghdad or damascus sanaa or tehran and support political and economic reform in the|middle|east and north|africa that can meet the legitimate aspiration of ordinary people throughout the region support for these principle be not a secondary interest.&nbsp today want to make clear that be a top priority that must be translate into concrete action and support by all of the diplomatic economic and strategic tool at disposal let be specific.&nbsp first will be the policy of the|united|state to promote reform across the region and to support transition to democracy.&nbsp that effort begin in egypt and tunisia where the stake be high as tunisia be at the vanguard of this democratic wave and egypt be both a longstanding partner and the arab world ’s large nation.&nbsp both nation can set a strong example through free and fair election a vibrant civil society accountable and effective democratic institution and responsible regional leadership.&nbsp but support must also extend to nation where transition have yet to take place unfortunately in too many country call for change have thus far be answer by violence.&nbsp the most extreme example be libya where muammar|qaddafi launch a war against own people promise to hunt down like rats.&nbsp as say when the|united|states join an international coalition to intervene can not prevent every injustice perpetrate by a regime against people and have learn from experience in iraq just how costly and difficult be to try to impose regime change by force no matter how well intentione may be but in libya see the prospect of imminent massacre have a mandate for action and hear the libyan people ’s call for help.&nbsp have not act along with nato ally and regional coalition partner thousand would have be killed.&nbsp the message would have be clear:&nbsp keep power by kill as many people as takes.&nbsp now time be work against qaddafi do not have control over country.&nbsp the opposition have organize a legitimate and credible interim council.&nbsp and when qaddafi inevitably leave or be force from power decade of provocation will come to an end and the transition to a democratic libya can proceed while libya have face violence on the great scale ’s not the only place where leader have turn to repression to remain in power.&nbsp most recently the syrian regime have choose the path of murder and the mass arrest of citizens.&nbsp the|united|states have condemn these action and work with the international community have step up sanction on the syrian regime –- include sanction announce yesterday on president assad and those around the syrian people have show courage in demand a transition to democracy.&nbsp president assad now have a choice:&nbsp can lead that transition or get out of the way.&nbsp the syrian government must stop shoot demonstrator and allow peaceful protests.&nbsp must release political prisoner and stop unjust arrests.&nbsp must allow human right monitor to have access to city like dara’a and start a serious dialogue to advance a democratic transition.&nbsp otherwise president assad and regime will continue to be challenge from within and will continue to be isolate abroad so far syria have follow iranian ally seek assistance from tehran in the tactic of suppression.&nbsp and this speak to the hypocrisy of the iranian regime which say stand for the right of protester abroad yet repress own people at home.&nbsp let remember that the first peaceful protest in the region be in the street of tehran where the government brutalize woman and man and throw innocent people into jail.&nbsp still hear the chant echo from the rooftop of tehran.&nbsp the image of a young woman die in the street be still sear in memory.&nbsp and will continue to insist that the iranian people deserve universal right and a government that do not smother aspiration now opposition to iran ’s intolerance and iran ’s repressive measure as well as illicit nuclear program and support of terror be well known.&nbsp but if america be to be credible must acknowledge that at time friend in the region have not all react to the demand for consistent change with change that ’s consistent with the principle that have outline today.&nbsp that ’s true in yemen where president saleh need to follow through on commitment to transfer power.&nbsp and that ’s true today in bahrain bahrain be a longstanding partner and be committed to security.&nbsp recognize that iran have try to take advantage of the turmoil there and that the bahraini government have a legitimate interest in the rule of law.&nbsp nevertheless have insist both publicly and privately that mass arrest and brute force be at odd with the universal right of bahrain ’s citizen and will and such step will not make legitimate call for reform go away.&nbsp the only way forward be for the government and opposition to engage in a dialogue and can not have a real dialogue when part of the peaceful opposition be in jail.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp the government must create the condition for dialogue and the opposition must participate to forge a just future for all bahrainis indeed of the broad lesson to be draw from this period be that sectarian divide need not lead to conflict.&nbsp in iraq see the promise of a multiethnic multisectarian democracy.&nbsp the iraqi people have reject the peril of political violence in favor of a democratic process even as have take full responsibility for own security.&nbsp of course like all new democracy will face setbacks.&nbsp but iraq be poise to play a key role in the region if continue peaceful progress.&nbsp and as do will be proud to stand with as a steadfast partner so in the|months|ahead america must use all influence to encourage reform in the region.&nbsp even as acknowledge that each country be different need to speak honestly about the principle that believe in with friend and foe alike.&nbsp message be if take the risk that reform entail will have the full support of the united states.&nbsp must also build on effort to broaden engagement beyond elite so that reach the people who will shape the future particularly young people.&nbsp will continue to make good on the commitment that make in cairo to build network of entrepreneur and expand exchange in education to foster cooperation in science and technology and combat disease.&nbsp across the region intend to provide assistance to civil society include those that may not be officially sanction and who speak uncomfortable truths.&nbsp and will use the technology to connect with and listen to –- the voice of the people for the fact be real reform do not come at the ballot box alone.&nbsp through effort must support those basic right to speak mind and access information.&nbsp will support open access to the internet and the right of journalist to be hear whether ’ a big news organization or a lone blogger.&nbsp in the|21st|century information be power the truth can not be hide and the legitimacy of government will ultimately depend on active and informed citizen such open discourse be important even if what be say do not square with worldview.&nbsp let be clear america respect the right of all peaceful and law abide voice to be hear even if disagree with them.&nbsp and sometimes profoundly disagree with look forward to work with all who embrace genuine and inclusive democracy.&nbsp what will oppose be an attempt by any group to restrict the right of other and to hold power through coercion and not consent.&nbsp because democracy depend not only on election but also strong and accountable institution and the respect for the right of minority such tolerance be particularly important when come to religion.&nbsp in tahrir|square hear egyptians from all walk of life chant “ muslims christians be america will work to see that this spirit prevail that all faith be respect and that bridge be build among them.&nbsp in a region that be the birthplace of world religion intolerance can lead only to suffering and stagnation.&nbsp and for this season of change to succeed coptic christians must have the right to worship freely in cairo just as shia must never have mosque destroy in bahrain what be true for religious minority be also true when come to the right of women.&nbsp history show that country be more prosperous and more peaceful when woman be and that ’s why will continue to insist that universal right apply to woman as well as man by focus assistance on child and maternal health by help woman to teach or start a business by stand up for the right of woman to have voice hear and to run for office.&nbsp the region will never reach full potential when more|than|half of population be prevent from achieve full potential.&nbsp applause now even as promote political reform even as promote human right in the region effort can not stop there.&nbsp so the second way that must support positive change in the region be through effort to advance economic development for nation that be transition to democracy.&nbsp after all politic alone have not put protester into the streets.&nbsp the tipping point for so many people be the more constant concern of put food on the table and provide for a family.&nbsp too many people in the region wake up with few expectation other than make through the|day perhaps hope that luck will change.&nbsp throughout the region many young people have a solid education but closed economy leave unable to find a job.&nbsp entrepreneur be brim with idea but corruption leave unable to profit from those ideas.&nbsp the great untapped resource in the|middle|east and north|africa be the talent of people.&nbsp in the recent protest see that talent on display as people harness technology to move the world.&nbsp ’ no coincidence that of the leader of tahrir|square be an executive for google.&nbsp that energy now need to be channel in country after country so that economic growth can solidify the accomplishment of the street.&nbsp for just as democratic revolution can be trigger by a lack of individual opportunity successful democratic transition depend upon an expansion of growth and broad base prosperity so draw from what have learn around the world think ’ important to focus on trade not just aid on investment not just assistance.&nbsp the goal must be a model in which protectionism give way to openness the reign of commerce pass from the few to the many and the economy generate job for the young.&nbsp america ’s support for democracy will therefore be base on ensure financial stability promote reform and integrate competitive market with each other and the global economy.&nbsp and be go to start with tunisia and egypt first have ask the|world|bank and the|international|monetary|fund to present a plan at next|week ’s g8 summit for what need to be do to stabilize and modernize the economy of tunisia and egypt.&nbsp together must help recover from the disruption of democratic upheaval and support the government that will be elect later this year.&nbsp and be urge other country to help egypt and tunisia meet near term financial need do not want a democratic egypt to be saddle by the debt of past.&nbsp so will relieve a democratic egypt of up|to|$1|billion in debt and work with egyptian partner to invest these resource to foster growth and entrepreneurship.&nbsp will help egypt regain access to market by guarantee in borrowing that be need to finance infrastructure and job creation.&nbsp and will help newly democratic government recover asset that be steal third be work with congress to create enterprise fund to invest in tunisia and egypt.&nbsp and these will be model on fund that support the transition in after the fall of the|berlin|wall.&nbsp opic will soon launch a facility to support private investment across the region.&nbsp and will work with the ally to refocus the|european|bank|for|reconstruction|and|development so that provide the same support for democratic transition and economic modernization in the|middle|east and north|africa as have in europe fourth the|united|states will launch a comprehensive trade|and|investment|partnership|initiative in the|middle|east and north|africa.&nbsp if take out oil export this entire region of over|400|million people export roughly the same amount as switzerland.&nbsp so will work with the eu to facilitate more trade within the region build on exist agreement to promote integration with u.s. and european market and open the door for those country who adopt high standard of reform and trade liberalization to construct a regional trade arrangement.&nbsp and just as eu membership serve as an incentive for reform in europe so should the vision of a modern and prosperous economy create a powerful force for reform in the|middle|east and north|africa.&nbsp;&nbsp prosperity also require tear down wall that stand in the way of progress the corruption of elite who steal from people the red tape that stop an idea from become a business the patronage that distribute wealth base on tribe or sect.&nbsp will help government meet international obligation and invest effort at anti - corruption by work with parliamentarian who be develop reform and activist who use technology to increase transparency and hold government accountable.&nbsp politic and human right economic reform let conclude by talk about another cornerstone of approach to the region and that relate to the pursuit of peace for decade the conflict between israelis and arabs have cast a shadow over the region.&nbsp for israelis have mean live with the fear that child could be blow up on a bus or by rocket fire at home as well as the pain of know that other child in the region be teach to hate them.&nbsp for palestinians have mean suffer the humiliation of occupation and never live in a nation of own.&nbsp moreover this conflict have come with a large cost to the|middle|east as impede partnership that could bring great security and prosperity and empowerment to ordinary people for over two|year administration have work with the party and the international community to end this conflict build on decade of work by previous administrations.&nbsp yet expectation have go israeli settlement activity continues.&nbsp palestinians have walk away from talks.&nbsp the world look at a conflict that have grind on and on and on and see nothing but stalemate.&nbsp indeed there be those who argue that with all the change and uncertainty in the region be simply not possible to move forward now disagree.&nbsp at a time when the people of the|middle|east and north|africa be cast off the burden of the past the drive for a lasting peace that end the conflict and resolve all claim be more urgent than ever.&nbsp that ’s certainly true for the party involve for the palestinians effort to delegitimize israel will end in failure.&nbsp symbolic action to isolate israel at the|united|nation in september will not create an independent state palestinian leader will not achieve peace or prosperity if hamas insist on a path of terror and rejection.&nbsp and palestinians will never realize independence by deny the right of israel to exist as for israel friendship be root deeply in a share history and share values.&nbsp commitment to israel ’s security be unshakeable.&nbsp and will stand against attempt to single out for criticism in international forums.&nbsp but precisely because of friendship ’ important that tell the truth:&nbsp the status quo be unsustainable and israel too must act boldly to advance a lasting peace the fact be a grow number of palestinians live west of the jordan river.&nbsp technology will make harder for israel to defend itself.&nbsp a region undergo profound change will lead to populism in which million of people not just or leader must believe peace be possible.&nbsp the international community be tired of an endless process that never produce an outcome the dream of a jewish and democratic state can not be fulfil with permanent occupation now ultimately be up to the israelis and palestinians to take action.&nbsp no peace can be impose upon not by the|united|state not by anybody else.&nbsp but endless delay will not make the problem go away.&nbsp what america and the international community can do be to state frankly what everyone know a lasting peace will involve state for peoples:&nbsp israel as a jewish state and the homeland for the jewish people and the state of palestine as the homeland for the palestinian people each state enjoy self determination mutual recognition and peace so while the core issue of the conflict must be negotiate the basis of those negotiation be clear:&nbsp a viable palestine a secure israel.&nbsp the|united|states believe that negotiation should result in state with permanent palestinian border with israel jordan and egypt and permanent israeli border with palestine.&nbsp believe the border of israel and palestine should be base on the line with mutually agree swap so that secure and recognize border be establish for both states.&nbsp the palestinian people must have the right to govern and reach full potential in a sovereign and contiguous state.&nbsp as for security every state have the right to self defense and israel must be able to defend by against any threat.&nbsp provision must also be robust enough to prevent a resurgence of terrorism to stop the infiltration of weapon and to provide effective border security.&nbsp the full and phase withdrawal of israeli military force should be coordinate with the assumption of palestinian security responsibility in a sovereign non - militarized state.&nbsp and the duration of this transition period must be agree and the effectiveness of security arrangement must be demonstrate these principle provide a foundation for negotiations.&nbsp palestinians should know the territorial outline of state israelis should know that basic security concern will be met.&nbsp be aware that these step alone will not resolve the conflict because wrenching and emotional issue will remain:&nbsp the future of jerusalem and the fate of palestinian refugees.&nbsp but move forward now on the basis of territory and security provide a foundation to resolve those issue in a way that be just and fair and that respect the right and aspiration of both israelis and palestinians.&nbsp now let say this:&nbsp recognize that negotiation need to begin with the issue of territory and security do not mean that will be easy to come back to the table.&nbsp in particular the recent announcement of an agreement between fatah and hamas raise profound and legitimate question for israel:&nbsp how can one negotiate with a party that have show unwilling to recognize right to exist?&nbsp and in the|weeks|and|month to come palestinian leader will have to provide a credible answer to that question.&nbsp meanwhile quartet partner and the arab state will need to continue every effort to get beyond the current impasse recognize how hard this will be.&nbsp suspicion and hostility have be pass on for generation and at time have harden but be convince that the majority of israelis and palestinians would rather look to the future than be trap in the past.&nbsp see that spirit in the israeli father whose son be kill by hamas who help start an organization that bring together israelis and palestinians who have lose love ones.&nbsp that father say gradually realize that the only hope for progress be to recognize the face of the conflict.”&nbsp see in the action of a palestinian who lose daughter to israeli shell in gaza.&nbsp “ have the right to feel angry said.&nbsp so many people be expect to hate.&nbsp answer to be shall not hate.&nbsp let hope say “ for tomorrow that be the choice that must be make not simply in the israeli palestinian conflict but across the entire region a choice between hate and hope between the shackle of the past and the promise of the future.&nbsp ’ a choice that must be make by leader and by the people and ’ a choice that will define the future of a region that serve as the cradle of civilization and a crucible of strife for all the challenge that lie ahead see many reason to be hopeful.&nbsp in egypt see in the effort of young people who lead protests.&nbsp in syria see in the courage of those who brave bullet while chant “ peaceful peaceful.”&nbsp a city threaten with destruction see in the courthouse square where people gather to celebrate the freedom that have never known.&nbsp across the region those right that take for grant be be claim with joy by those who be pry loose the grip of an iron fist for the american people the scene of upheaval in the region may be unsettling but the force drive be not unfamiliar.&nbsp own nation be found through a rebellion against an empire.&nbsp people fight a painful civil|war that extend freedom and dignity to those who be enslaved.&nbsp and would not be stand here today unless past generation turn to the moral force of nonviolence as a way to perfect union –- organizing march protest peacefully together to make real those word that declare nation:&nbsp hold these truth to be self evident that all man be create equal.”&nbsp those word must guide response to the change that be transform the|middle|east and north|africa word which tell that repression will fail and that tyrant will fall and that every man and woman be endow with certain inalienable rights.&nbsp will not be easy.&nbsp there ’s no straight line to progress and hardship always accompany a season of hope.&nbsp but be found on the belief that people should govern themselves.&nbsp and now can not hesitate to stand squarely on the side of those who be reach for right know that success will bring about a world that be more peaceful more stable and more just thank very much everybody.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp

company to invest in basic research throughout history government have provide cutting edge scientist and inventor with the support that need.&nbsp that ’s what plant the seed for the internet.&nbsp that ’s what help make possible thing like computer chip and gps.&nbsp just think of all the good job from manufacture to retail that have come from these breakthrough & half|a|century|ago when the soviets beat into space with the launch of a satellite call sputnik have no idea how would beat to the moon.&nbsp the science be not even there yet.&nbsp nasa do not exist.&nbsp but after invest in well research and education do not just surpass the soviets unleash a wave of innovation that create new industry and million of new job & this be generation ’s sputnik moment.&nbsp two|years|ago say

invest in biomedical research information technology and especially clean energy technology applause an investment that will strengthen security protect planet and create countless new job for people & already be see the promise of renewable energy.&nbsp robert and gary|allen be brother who run a small michigan roof company.&nbsp after september|11th volunteer good roofer to help repair the

across the country.&nbsp in robert ’s word reinvent & that ’s what americans have do for over|200|year reinvent ourselves.&nbsp and to spur on more success story like the|allen|brother have begin to reinvent energy policy be not just hand out money.&nbsp be issue a challenge.&nbsp be tell america ’s scientist and engineer that if assemble team of the good mind in field and focus on the hard problem in clean energy will fund the apollo project of time & at the|california|institute|of|technology be develop a way to turn sunlight and water into fuel for cars.&nbsp at oak|ridge|national|laboratory be use supercomputer to get a lot more power out of nuclear facilities.&nbsp with more research and incentive can break dependence on oil with biofuel and become the first country to have a electric vehicle on the road by applause & need to get behind this innovation.&nbsp and to help pay for be ask congress to eliminate the billion in taxpayer dollar currently give to oil companies.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp do not know if do not know if have notice but be do just fine on own.&nbsp laughter.)&nbsp so instead of subsidize yesterday ’s energy let invest in tomorrow ’s & now clean energy breakthrough will only translate into clean energy job if business know there will be a market for what be selling.&nbsp so tonight challenge to join in set a new goal:&nbsp by of america ’s electricity will come from clean energy sources.&nbsp applause & some folk want wind and solar.&nbsp other want nuclear clean coal and natural gas.&nbsp to meet this goal will need all and urge democrats and republicans to work together to make happen.&nbsp applause & maintain leadership in research and technology be crucial to america ’s success.&nbsp but if want to win the future if want innovation to produce job in america and not overseas then also have to win the race to educate kid & think about it.&nbsp over the|next|10|year nearly|half of all new job will require education that go beyond a high school education.&nbsp and yet as|many|as|a|quarte of student be not even finish high school.&nbsp the quality of math and science education lag behind many other nations.&nbsp america have fall to ninth in the proportion of young people with a college degree.&nbsp and so the question be whether all of –- as citizen and as parent –- be willing to do what ’s necessary to give every child a chance to succeed & that responsibility begin not in classroom but in home and communities.&nbsp ’s family that first instill the love of learn in a child.&nbsp only parent can make sure the tv be turn off and homework get done.&nbsp need to teach kid that ’s not just the winner of the|super|bowl who deserve to be celebrate but the winner of the science fair.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp need to teach that success be not a function of fame or pr but of hard work and discipline & school share this responsibility.&nbsp when a child walk into a classroom should be a place of high expectation and high performance.&nbsp but too many school do not meet this test that ’s why instead of just pour money into a system that ’s not work launch a competition call to all state say if show the most innovative plan to improve teacher quality and student achievement will show the money & race|to|the|top be the most meaningful reform of public school in a generation.&nbsp for less|than|1|percent of what spend on education each|year have lead over|40 state to raise standard for teaching and learning.&nbsp and these standard be develop by the way not by washington but by republican and democratic governor throughout the country.&nbsp and race|to|the|top should be the approach follow this|year as replace no|child|left|behind with a law that ’s more flexible and focus on what ’s good for kids.&nbsp applause & see know what ’s possible from child when reform be not just a top down mandate but the work of local teacher and principal school board and communities.&nbsp take a school like bruce|randolph in denver.&nbsp three|years|ago be rat of the bad school in colorado locate on turf between|two rival gangs.&nbsp but of the senior receive diploma.&nbsp most will be the first in family to go to college.&nbsp and after the|first|year of the school ’s transformation the principal who make possible wipe away tear when a student say thank ms. waters for show that be smart and can make it.”&nbsp applause.)&nbsp that ’s what good school can do and want good school all across the country & let also remember that after parent the big impact on a child ’s success come from the man or woman at the front of the classroom.&nbsp in south|korea teacher be know as nation builders.”&nbsp here in america ’s time treat the people who educate child with the same level of respect.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp want to reward good teacher and stop make excuse for bad ones.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp and over the|next|10|year with so many baby boomer retire from classroom want to prepare new teacher in the field of science and technology and engineering and math.&nbsp applause & in fact to every young person listen tonight who ’s contemplate career choice:&nbsp if want to make a difference in the life of nation if want to make a difference in the life of a child become a teacher.&nbsp country need you.&nbsp applause & of course the education race do not end with a high school diploma.&nbsp to compete high education must be within the reach of every american.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp that ’s why have end the unwarranted taxpayer subsidy that go to bank and use the saving to make college affordable for million of students.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp and this|year ask congress to go further and make permanent tuition tax credit –- worth for four|year of college.&nbsp ’s the right thing to applause & because people need to be able to train for new job and career in today ’s fast change economy be also revitalize america ’s community colleges.&nbsp last|month see the promise of these school at forsyth|tech in many of the student there use to work in the surround factory that have since leave town.&nbsp mother of a woman name kathy|proctor have work in the furniture industry since be old.&nbsp and tell ’s earn degree in biotechnology now at not just because the furniture job be go but because want to inspire child to pursue dream too.&nbsp as kathy say hope tell to never give up & if take these step if raise expectation for every child and give the good possible chance at an education from the|day be bear until the last job take –- will reach the goal that set two|years|ago:&nbsp by the|end|of|the|decade america will once again have the high proportion of college graduate in the world.&nbsp applause & last point about|education.&nbsp today there be hundreds|of|thousand of student excel in school who be not american citizens.&nbsp some be the child of undocumented worker who have nothing to do with the action of parent grow up as americans and pledge allegiance to flag and yet live every day with the threat of deportation.&nbsp other come here from abroad to study in college and universities.&nbsp but as soon as obtain advanced degree send back home to compete against us.&nbsp make no sense & now strongly believe that should take on once and for all the issue of illegal immigration.&nbsp and be prepared to work with republicans and democrats to protect border enforce law and address the|million of undocumented worker who be now live in the shadows.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp know that debate will be difficult.&nbsp know will take time.&nbsp but tonight let agree to make that effort.&nbsp and let stop expel talented responsible young people who could be staff research lab or start a new business who could be further enrich this|nation.&nbsp applause & the third step in win the future be rebuild america.&nbsp to attract new business to shore need the fast most reliable way to move people good and information from high speed rail to high speed internet.&nbsp applause & infrastructure use to be the good but lead have slipped.&nbsp south|korean home now have great internet access than country in

and the midwest be already underway & within the|next|five|year will make possible for business to deploy the next generation of high speed wireless coverage to of all americans.&nbsp this be not just about applause this be not about fast internet or few drop calls.&nbsp ’s about connect every part of america to the digital age.&nbsp ’s about a rural community in iowa or alabama where farmer and small business owner will be able to sell product all over the world.&nbsp ’ about a firefighter who can download the design of a burn building onto a handheld device a student who can take class with a digital textbook or a patient who can have face to face video chat with doctor & all these investment in innovation education and infrastructure –- will make america a well place to do business and create jobs.&nbsp but to help company compete also have to knock down barrier that stand in the way of success & for example over the|year a parade of lobbyist have rig the tax code to benefit particular company and industries.&nbsp those with accountant or lawyer to work the system can end up pay no taxis at all.&nbsp but all the rest be hit with of the high corporate tax rate in the world.&nbsp make no sense and have to change.&nbsp applause & so tonight be ask democrats and republicans to simplify the system.&nbsp get rid of the loopholes.&nbsp level the play field.&nbsp and use the saving to lower the corporate tax rate for the first time in –- without add to deficit.&nbsp can be done.&nbsp applause & to help business sell more product abroad set a goal of double export by

states.&nbsp and last|month finalize a trade agreement with south|korea that will support at|least|70,000 american jobs.&nbsp this agreement have unprecedented support from business and labor democrats and republicans and ask this congress to pass as soon as possible.&nbsp applause & now before take office make clear that would enforce trade agreement and that would only sign deal that keep faith with american worker and promote american jobs.&nbsp that ’s what do with korea and that ’s what intend to do as pursue agreement with panama and colombia and continue asia|pacific and global trade talks.&nbsp applause & to reduce barrier to growth and investment have order a review of government regulations.&nbsp when find rule that put an unnecessary burden on business will fix them.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp but will not hesitate to create or enforce common sense safeguard to protect the american people.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp that ’s what have do in this country for more than a century.&nbsp ’s why food be safe to eat water be safe to drink and air be safe to breathe.&nbsp ’ why have speed limit and child labor laws.&nbsp ’s why last|year put in place consumer protection against hide fee and penalty by credit card company and new rule to prevent another financial crisis.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp and ’s why pass reform that finally prevent the health insurance industry from exploit patients.&nbsp applause & now have hear rumor that a few of still have concern about new health care law.&nbsp laughter.)&nbsp so let be the first to say that anything can be improved.&nbsp if have idea about how to improve this law by make care better or more affordable be eager to work with you.&nbsp can start right now by correct a flaw in the legislation that have place an unnecessary bookkeeping burden on small businesses.&nbsp applause & what be not willing to do what be not willing to do be go back to the|days when insurance company could deny someone coverage because of a preexist condition.&nbsp applause & be not willing to tell james|howard a brain cancer patient from texas that treatment may not be covered.&nbsp be not willing to tell jim|houser a small business man from oregon that have to go back to pay more to cover employees.&nbsp as speak this law be make prescription drug cheap for senior and give uninsured student a chance to stay on patient ’ parent ’ coverage.&nbsp applause & so say to this chamber tonight instead of re - fight the battle of the|last|two|year let fix what need fix and let move forward.&nbsp applause & now the final critical step in win the future be to make sure be not bury under a mountain of debt & be live with a legacy of deficit spending that begin almost|a|decade ago.&nbsp and in the wake of the financial crisis some of that be necessary to keep credit flowing save job and put money in people ’s pocket & but now that the bad of the recession be over have to confront the fact that government spend more than take in.&nbsp that be not sustainable.&nbsp every|day family sacrifice to live within means.&nbsp deserve a government that do the same & so tonight be propose that start this|year freeze annual domestic spending for the|next|five years.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp now this would reduce the deficit by more|than|$400|billion over and will bring discretionary spending to the low share of economy since dwight|eisenhower be president & this freeze will require painful cuts.&nbsp already have freeze the salary of hardworke federal employee for years.&nbsp have propose cut to thing care deeply about like community action programs.&nbsp the secretary of defense have also agree to cut tens|of|billions|of|dollar in spending that and general believe military can do without.&nbsp applause & recognize that some in this chamber have already propose deep cut and be willing to eliminate whatever can honestly afford to do without.&nbsp but let make sure that be not do on the back of most vulnerable citizens.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp and let make sure that what be cutting be really excess weight.&nbsp cut the deficit by gutte investment in innovation and education be like lighten an overload airplane by remove engine.&nbsp may make feel like be fly high at first but will not take long before feel the impact.&nbsp laughter & now most of the cut and saving have propose only address annual domestic spending which represent a|little|more|than|12|percent of budget.&nbsp to make further progress have to stop pretend that cut this kind of spending alone will be enough.&nbsp won’t.&nbsp applause & the bipartisan fiscal commission create last|year make this crystal clear.&nbsp do not agree with all proposal but make important progress.&nbsp and conclusion be that the only way to tackle deficit be to cut excessive spending wherever find –- in domestic spending defense spending health care spending and spend through tax break and loopholes.&nbsp applause & this mean further reduce health care cost include program like medicare and medicaid which be the single big contributor to long term deficit.&nbsp the health insurance law pass last|year will slow these rise cost which be part of the reason that nonpartisan economist have say that repeal the health care law would add a|quarter of a|trillion|dollars to deficit.&nbsp still be willing to look at other idea to bring down cost include that republicans suggest last|year medical malpractice reform to rein in frivolous lawsuits.&nbsp applause & to put on solid ground should also find a bipartisan solution to strengthen social|security for future generations.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp must do without put at risk current retiree the most vulnerable or people with disability without slash benefit for future generation and without subject americans ’ guarantee retirement income to the whim of the stock market.&nbsp applause & and if truly care about deficit simply can not afford a permanent extension of the tax cut for the wealthy of americans.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp before take money away from school or scholarship away from student should ask millionaire to give up tax break.&nbsp ’s not a matter of punish success.&nbsp ’s about promote america ’s success.&nbsp applause & in fact the good thing could do on taxis for all americans be to simplify the individual tax code.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp this will be a tough job but member of both party have express an interest in do this and be prepared to join them.&nbsp applause & so now be the time to act.&nbsp now be the time for both side and both house of congress –- democrats and republicans to forge a principled compromise that get the job done.&nbsp if make the hard choice now to rein in deficit can make the investment need to win the future & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp let take this step further.&nbsp should not just give people a government that ’s more affordable.&nbsp should give a government that ’s more competent and more efficient.&nbsp can not win the future with a government of the past.&nbsp applause & live and do business in the information age but the last major reorganization of the government happen in the age of black and white tv.&nbsp there be different agency that deal with exports.&nbsp there be at|least|five different agency that deal with housing policy.&nbsp then there ’s favorite example:&nbsp the|interior|department be in charge of salmon while be in fresh water but the|commerce|department handle when be in saltwater.&nbsp laughter.)&nbsp hear get even more complicated once

of the mouse.&nbsp be sell acre of federal office space that have not be use in year and will cut through red tape to get rid of more.&nbsp but need to think bigger.&nbsp in the|coming|months

project both party in congress should know this:&nbsp if a bill come to desk with earmark inside will veto it.&nbsp will veto it.&nbsp applause & the|21st|century government that ’s open and

republicans have certain belief and certain principle that each feel can not be compromised.&nbsp but what think the american people be expect and what owe be to focus on those issue that affect job security and future:&nbsp reduce deficit promote a clean energy economy make sure that child be the best educate in the world make sure that be make the investment in technology that will allow to keep competitive edge in the global economy & nbsp because the most important contest face be not the contest between democrats and republicans.&nbsp in this|century the most important competition face be between america and economic competitor around the world.&nbsp to win that competition and to continue economic leadership be go to need to be strong and be go to need to be unite none of the challenge face lend to simple solution or bumper sticker slogans.&nbsp nor be the answer find in any particular philosophy or ideology.&nbsp as have say before no person no party have a monopoly on wisdom.&nbsp and that ’s why be eager to hear good idea wherever come from whoever propose and that ’s why believe ’ important to have an honest and civil debate about the choice that face.&nbsp that ’s why want to engage both democrats and republicans in serious conversation about where be go as a nation and with so much at stake what the american people do not want from especially here in washington be to spend the|next|two|year refighte the political battle of the last two.&nbsp just have a tough election.&nbsp will have another in be not so naïve as to think that everybody will put politic aside until then but do hope to make progress on the very serious problem face right now and that ’s go to require all of include to work harder at build consensus know a|little|over|a|month|ago hold a town hall meeting in richmond virginia.&nbsp and of the most telling question come from a small business owner who run a tree care firm.&nbsp tell how hard work and how busy be how do not have time to pay attention to all the back and forth in washington.&nbsp and ask be there hope for return to civility in discourse to a healthy legislative process so as strap on the boot again tomorrow know that guy get under control?&nbsp ’ hard to have a faith in that right now say do believe there be hope for civility.&nbsp do believe there ’s hope for progress.&nbsp and that ’s because believe in the resiliency of a nation that ’s bounce back from much bad than what be go through right now a nation that be overcome war and depression that have be make more perfect in struggle for individual right and individual freedom & nbsp each time progress have come slowly and even painfully but progress have always come because have work at and because have believe in and most of all because remember that first allegiance as citizen be not to party or region or faction but to country because while may be proud democrats or proud republicans be prouder to be americans & nbsp and that be something that all need to remember right now and in the come months.&nbsp and if do have no doubt that will continue this nation ’s long journey towards a well future so with that let take some questions.&nbsp be go to start off with ben|feller at ap q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp thank mr. president.&nbsp be willing to concede at all that what happen last|night be not just an expression of frustration about the economy but a fundamental rejection of agenda?&nbsp and give the result who do think speak to the true voice of the american people right now:&nbsp or john|boehner the think that there be no doubt that people ’s number concern be the and what be express great frustration about be the fact that have not make enough progress on the economy.&nbsp have stabilize the economy have get job growth in the private sectors.&nbsp but people all across america be not feeling that progress.&nbsp do not see it.&nbsp and understand that be the president of the|united|state and that core responsibility be make sure that have get an economy that be grow a middle class that feel secure that job be be created.&nbsp and so think have get to take direct responsibility for the fact that have not make as much progress as need to make now move forward think the question be go to be can democrats and republicans sit down together and come up with a set of idea that address those core concerns.&nbsp be confident that can & nbsp think that there be some area where ’s go to be very difficult for to agree on but think there be go to be a whole bunch of area where can agree on.&nbsp do not think there ’s anybody in america who think that have get an energy policy that work the way need to that think that should not be work on energy independence.&nbsp and that give opportunity for democrats and republicans to come together and think about whether ’s natural gas or energy efficiency or how can build electric car in this country how do move forward on that agenda think everybody in this country think that have get to make sure kid be equip in term of education science background math background to compete in this new global economy.&nbsp and that ’s go to be an area where think there ’s potential common ground so on a whole range of issue there be go to be area where disagree.&nbsp think the overwhelming message that hear from the voter be that want everybody to act responsibly in washington.&nbsp want to work harder to arrive at consensus.&nbsp want to focus completely on job and the economy and grow so that be ensure a well future for child and grandchild and think that there ’s no doubt that as reflect on the result of the election underscore for that have get to do a well job just like everybody else in washington do q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp inaudible the well think john|boehner and and mitch|mcconnell and harry|reid and nancy|pelosi be go to have to sit down and work together because suspect that if talk to any individual voter yesterday would say there be some thing agree with democrats on there be some thing agree with republicans do not think people carry around with a fix ideology.&nbsp think the majority of people be go about business go about lives.&nbsp just want to make sure that be make progress.&nbsp and that ’s go to be top priority over q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp just follow up on what ben just talk about do not seem to be reflect or second guess any of the policy decision have make instead say the message the voter be send be about frustration with the economy or maybe even chalk up to a failure on part to communicate effectively if be not reflect on policy agenda be possible voter can conclude be still not get the well savannah that be just the first question so be go to have a few more here.&nbsp be do a whole lot of reflect and think that there be go to be area in policy where be go to have to do a well job think that over the|last|two|year have make a series of very tough decision but decision that be right in term of move the country forward in an emergency situation where have the risk of slip into a second great|depression but what be absolutely true be that with all that stuff come at folk fast and furious a recovery package what have to do with respect to the bank what have to do with respect to the auto company think people start look at all this and feel as if government be get much more intrusive into people ’s live than be accustomed to & nbsp now the reason be be an emergency situation.&nbsp but think ’ understandable that folk say to know maybe this be the agenda as oppose to a response to an emergency.&nbsp and that ’s something that think everybody in the|white|house understand be a danger.&nbsp think be necessary but be sympathetic to folk who look at and say this be look like potential overreach & nbsp in addition there be a bunch of price tag that go with that.&nbsp and so even though these be emergency situation people rightly say gosh already have all this debt already have these big deficit this be potentially go to compound and at what point be go to get back to a situation where be do what family all around the country do which be make sure that if spend something know how to pay for as oppose to rack up the credit card for the next generation and think that the other thing that happen be that when win election in of the reason think that people be excite about the campaign be the prospect that would change how business be do in washington.&nbsp and be in such a hurry to get thing do that do not change how thing get done.&nbsp and think that frustrated people be a strong believer that the earmark process in congress be not what the american people really want to see when come to make tough decision about how taxpayer dollar be spent.&nbsp and in the rush to get thing do have to sign a bunch of bill that have earmark in which be contrary to what have talk about.&nbsp and think folk look at that and say gosh this feel like the same partisan squabbling this seem like the same way of do business as happen before and so of the thing that have get to take responsibility for be not have move enough on those fronts.&nbsp and think there be an opportunity to move forward on some of those issues.&nbsp understanding be eric|cantor today say that want to see a moratorium on earmark that ’s something think can can work on together q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp would still resist the notion that voter reject the policy choice make the well savannah think that what think be absolutely true be voter be not satisfied with the if right now have unemployment instead of unemployment then people would have more confidence in those policy choices.&nbsp the fact be be that for most folk proof of whether work or not be have the economy get back to where need to be.&nbsp and have not and so job be to make sure that be look at all idea that be on the table.&nbsp when come to job creation if republicans have good idea for job growth that can drive down the unemployment rate and have not think of have not look at but think have a chance of working want to try some so on the policy front think the most important thing be to say that be not go to rule out idea because be democrat or republican want to just see what works.&nbsp and ultimately will be judge as president as to the bottom line result mike|emanuel q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp thank mr. president.&nbsp health care as be well aware obviously a lot of republicans run against health care law.&nbsp some have call for repeal the law.&nbsp be wonder sir if believe that health care reform that work so hard on be in danger at this point and whether there ’s a threat as a result of this election the well know that there ’s some republican candidate who win last|night who feel very strongly about it.&nbsp be sure that this will be an issue that come up in discussion with the republican leadership.&nbsp as say before though think would be misread the election if think that the american people want to see for the|next|two|year relitigate argument that have over the|last|two|year with respect to the health care law generally and this may go to some of the question that savannah be raise know when talk to a woman from new|hampshire who do not have to mortgage house because get cancer and be seek treatment but now be able to get health insurance when talk to parent who be relieve that child with a preexist condition can now stay on policy until be and give time to transition to find a job that will give health insurance or the small business that be now take advantage of the tax credit that be provide then say to this be the right thing to do now if the republicans have idea for how to improve health care system if want to suggest modification that would deliver fast and more effective reform to a health care system that have be wildly expensive for too many family and business and certainly for federal government be happy to consider some of those idea & nbsp know for example know of the thing that ’s come up be that the provision in the health care bill appear to be too burdensome for small businesses.&nbsp just involve too much paperwork too much filing.&nbsp ’s probably counterproductive be design to make sure that revenue be raise to help pay for some of the other provision but if end up just be so much trouble that small business find difficult to manage that be something that should take a look at so there be go to be example where think can tweak and make improvement on the progress that have made.&nbsp that be true for any significant piece of legislation & nbsp but do not think that if ask the american people should stop try to close the doughnut hole that will help senior citizen get prescription drug should go back to a situation where people with preexist condition can not get health insurance should allow insurance company to drop coverage when get sick even though have be pay premium do not think that would have a strong vote for people say those be provision want to eliminate q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp accord to some exit poll sir about|one out of voter apparently say that would like to either see overturn or repealed.&nbsp be concerned that that may embolden voter who be from the other party perhaps the well also mean out of voter think be the right thing to and obviously this be an issue that have be contentious.&nbsp but as say think what be go to be useful be for to go through the issue that republicans have issue on not sort of talk generally but let talk specifics.&nbsp do this particular provision when come to preexist condition be this something be for or be against?&nbsp helping senior get prescription drug do that make sense or not and if take that approach which be different from campaign mean this be now govern then think that can continue to make some progress and find some common ground chip|reid q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp thank mr. president.&nbsp republicans say more than anything else what this election be about be and say will be when hell freeze over that will accept anything remotely like a stimulus bill or any kind of a proposal have out there to stimulate job growth through spending.&nbsp do accept the fact that any kind of spending to create job be dead at this point?&nbsp and if so what else can government do to create job which be the number issue the well think this be go to be an important question for democrats and republicans think the american people be absolutely concerned about spending and debt and deficits.&nbsp and be go to have a deficit commission that be put forward ideas.&nbsp ’ a bipartisan group that include republican and democratic member of congress.&nbsp hopefully be able to arrive at some consensus on some area where can eliminate program that do not work cut back on government spending that be inefficient can streamline government but be not cut into the core investment that be go to make sure that be a competitive economy that be grow and provide opportunity for year to come so the question think that republican friend and and democratic leader be go to have answer be what be priorities?&nbsp what do care about?&nbsp and that ’s go to be a tough debate because there be some tough choice here & nbsp already have a big deficit that inherit and that have be make bad because of the recession.&nbsp as bring down want to make sure that be not cut into education that be go to help define whether or not can compete around the world.&nbsp do not think should be cut back on research and development because if can develop new technology in area like clean energy that could make all the difference in term of job creation here at home think the proposal that put forward with respect to infrastructure be one that historically have have bipartisan agreement about.&nbsp and should be able to agree now that make no sense for china to have well rail system than and singapore have well airport than us.&nbsp and just learn that china now have the fast supercomputer on earth that use to be us.&nbsp be make investment because know those investment will pay off over the long term and so in these budget discussion the key be to be able to distinguish between stuff that be not add to growth be not an investment in future and those thing that be absolutely necessary for to be able to increase job growth in the future as well now the single most important thing think need to do economically and this be something that have to be do during the lame duck session be make sure that taxis do not go up on middle class family next and so have get some work to do on that front to make sure that family not only be not see a high tax burden which will automatically happen if congress do not act but also make sure that business provision that historically have extend each|year that for example provide tax break for company that be invest here in the|united|state in research and development that those be think make sense for to extend unemployment insurance because there be still a lot of folk out there hurt so there be some thing that can do right now that will help sustain the recovery and advance even as be also sit down and figure out okay over what kind of budget cut can make that be intelligent that be smart that will not be undermine recovery but in fact will be encouraging job growth q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp but most of those thing that just call investment call wasteful spending and say ’ dead on arrival.&nbsp sound like without support can not get any of through the well what be absolutely true be be that without any republican support on anything then ’s go to be hard to get thing done.&nbsp but be not go to anticipate that be not go to support anything.&nbsp think that part of the message send to republicans be want to see strong job growth in this country.&nbsp and if there be good idea about put people to work that traditionally have garner republican support and that do not add to the deficit then hope be and expectation be be that that ’s something be willing to have a serious conversation about when come to for example the proposal put forward to accelerate depreciation for business so that if be build a plant or invest in new equipment next|year that can take a complete write off next|year get a huge tax break next|year and that would then encourage a lot of business to get off the sideline that be not historically consider a liberal idea.&nbsp that be actually an idea that business group and republicans think have support for a very long time so again the question be go to be do all come to the table with an open mind and say to what do think be actually go to make a difference for the american people that be how be go to be judge over q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp thank mr. president.&nbsp after election two|years|ago when meet with republicans say that in discuss what policy may go forward that election have consequence and that point out that have won.&nbsp wonder what consequence think this election should have then in term of policies.&nbsp be there area that be willing can name today area that would be willing to compromise on that may not have be willing to compromise on in the past the well think have be willing to compromise in the past and be go to be willing to compromise go forward on a whole range of issues.&nbsp let give an example the issue of energy that just mention & nbsp think there be a lot of republicans that run against the energy bill that pass in the house last|year.&nbsp and so ’s doubtful that could get the vote to pass that through the house this|year or next|year or the|year|after.&nbsp but that do not mean there be not agreement that should have a well energy policy.&nbsp and so let find those area where can agree have get think broad agreement that have get terrific natural gas resource in this country.&nbsp be do everything can to develop those?&nbsp there be a lot of agreement around the need to make sure that electric car be develop here in the|united|state that do not fall behind other countries.&nbsp be there thing that can do to encourage that?&nbsp and there be already be bipartisan interest on those issue there be be discussion about how can restart nuclear industry as a means of reduce dependence on foreign oil and reduce greenhouse gases.&nbsp be that an area where can move forward be able over the|last|two|year to increase for the first time in fuel efficiency standard on car and trucks.&nbsp do not even need legislation.&nbsp just need the cooperation of automaker and autoworker and investor and other and that be go to move forward in a serious way so think when come to something like energy what be probably go to have to do be say here be some area where there be just too much disagreement between democrats and republicans can not get this do right now but let not wait.&nbsp let go ahead and start make some progress on the thing that do agree on and can continue to have a strong and healthy debate about those area where do not q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp be there anything in the|“pledge|to|america that think can support the know be sure there be go to be area particularly around for example reform how washington work that will be interested think the american people want to see more transparency more openness.&nbsp as say in the midst of economic crisis think of the thing take responsibility for be not have push harder on some of those issues.&nbsp and think if take republicans and democrats at word this be an area that want to deliver on for the american people want to be supportive of that effort jake|tapper q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp thank mr. president.&nbsp have a policy question and a personal one.&nbsp the policy question be talk about how the immediate goal be the bush tax cut and make sure that do not expire for those who earn republicans disagree with that strongly.&nbsp want all of the bush tax cut extended.&nbsp be willing to compromise on that be willing to negotiate at all for instance allow to expire for everyone million?&nbsp where be willing to budge on that and the second one be president bush when go through a similar thing come out and say this be a “ thumpin’.”&nbsp talk about how be humble or allude to perhaps be and be wonder when call friend like congressman|perriello or governor strickland and see state legislature go to the other side governorship in swing state set back what do feel like the feel bad.&nbsp laughter.)&nbsp know the tough thing over the|last|couple|of|days be see really terrific public servant not have the opportunity to serve anymore at least in the short term.&nbsp and mention there be just some terrific member of congress who take really tough vote because think be the right thing even though know this could cause political problem and even though a lot of come from really tough swing district or majority republican districts.&nbsp and the amount of courage that show and conviction that show be something that admire so much.&nbsp can not overstate and so there be a not only sadness about see go but there ’s also a lot of question on part in term of could have do something differently or do something more so that those folk would still be here & nbsp ’ hard.&nbsp and take responsibility for in a lot of way & nbsp will tell have be incredibly gracious when have conversation with them.&nbsp and what have tell be know do not have regret because feel like be do the right thing.&nbsp and may be just say that to make feel well which again be a sign of character and class.&nbsp and hope a lot of continue to pursue public service because think be terrific public servant with respect to the tax cut issue goal be to make sure that do not have a huge spike in taxis for middle class families.&nbsp not only would that be a terrible burden on family who be already go through tough time would be bad for be very important that be not take a whole bunch of money out of the system from people who be most likely to spend that money on good service grocery buy a new winter coat for the kid that ’s also why think unemployment insurance be important not only be the right thing to do for folk who be still look for work and struggle in this really tough economy but ’s the right thing to do for the economy as a whole so goal be to sit down with speaker elect boehner and mitch|mcconnell and harry and nancy sometime in the|next|few|week and see where can move forward in a way that first of all do no harm that extend those tax cut that be very important for middle class family also extend those provision that be important to encourage business to invest and provide business some certainty over the|next|year or and how that negotiation work out think be too early to say.&nbsp but this be go to be of top priority and hope be be that give all have an interest in grow the economy and encouraging job growth that be not go to play brinksmanship but instead be go to act responsibly q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp so be willing to negotiate the absolutely laura|meckler q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp thank mr. president.&nbsp say earlier that be clear that congress be reject the idea of a cap and trade program and that would not be able to move forward with that look ahead do feel the same way about epa regulate carbon emissions?&nbsp would be open to do essentially the same thing through an administrative action or be that off the table as well & nbsp and secondly just to follow up on what say about change the way washington work do think that say do not do enough to change the way thing be handle in this city.&nbsp some of in order to get health care bill pass need to make some of those deals.&nbsp do wish in retrospect have not make those deal even if mean the collapse of the program the think that make sure that family have security and be on a trajectory to lower health care cost be absolutely critical for this country.&nbsp but be absolutely right that when be navigate through a house and a senate in this kind of pretty partisan environment that ’ a ugly mess when come to process.&nbsp and think that be something that really affect how people view the outcome.&nbsp that be something that regret that could not have make the process more healthy than end up being.&nbsp but think the outcome be a good one & nbsp with respect to the epa think the smart thing for to do be to see if can get democrats and republicans in a room who be serious about energy independence and be serious about keep air clean and water clean and deal with the issue of greenhouse gas and see be there way that can make progress in the short term and invest in technology in the long term that start give the tool to reduce greenhouse gas and solve this problem the epa be under a court order that say greenhouse gas be a pollutant that fall under jurisdiction and think of the thing that be very important for be not to have ignore the science but rather to find way that can solve these problem that do not hurt the economy that encourage the development of clean energy in this country that in fact may give opportunity to create entire new industry and create job that and that put in a competitive posture around the world so think ’s too early to say whether or not can make some progress on that front.&nbsp think can.&nbsp cap and trade be just way of skin the cat be not the only way.&nbsp be a means not an end.&nbsp and be go to be look for other mean to address this problem and think epa want help from the legislature on this.&nbsp do not think that the desire be to somehow be protective of power here.&nbsp think what want to do be make sure that the issue be be deal with q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp thank mr. president.&nbsp want to do a personal and policy as well.&nbsp on personal have a lot of fun on the campaign trail by say that the republicans be drink a slurpee and sit on the sideline while be try to pull the car out of the ditch.&nbsp but the point of the story be that say if want to go forward put the car in d if want to go backwards put in r.”&nbsp now that there are|least|60 house district that seem to have reject that message be possible that there be a majority of americans who think policy be take in reverse?&nbsp and what specific change will make to approach to try to fix that and better connect with the american people and just on a policy front “ do not ask do not tell be something that promise to end.&nbsp and when have vote and vote in the senate ’ a tough issue have not be able to do it.&nbsp do now have to tell liberal base that with maybe or vote in the senate be just not go to be able to get do in the|next|two|year the well let take the second issue first.&nbsp have be a strong believer in the notion that if somebody be willing to serve in military in uniform put life on the line for security that should not be prevent from do so because of sexual orientation.&nbsp and since there ’s be a lot of discussion about poll over the|last|48|hour think ’s worth note that the overwhelming majority of americans feel the same way.&nbsp ’s the right thing to do now as commander in chief have say that make this change need to be do in an orderly fashion.&nbsp have work with the pentagon work with secretary gates work with admiral mullen to make sure that be look at this in a systemic way that maintain good order and discipline but that need to change this policy & nbsp there ’s go to be a review that come out at that will have survey attitude and opinion within the armed forces.&nbsp will expect that secretary of and chairman of the|joint|chiefs|of|staff admiral mullen will have something to say about that review.&nbsp will look at very carefully.&nbsp but that will give time to act in potentially during the lame duck session to change this policy & nbsp keep in mind have get a bunch of court case that be out there as well.&nbsp and something that would be very disruptive to good order and discipline and unit cohesion be if have get this issue bounce around in the court as already have over the|last|several|week where the pentagon and the chain of command do not know at any give time what rule be work under & nbsp need to provide certainty and ’s time for to move this policy forward.&nbsp and this should not be a partisan issue.&nbsp this be an issue as say where have get a sizable portion of the american people squarely behind the notion that folk who be willing to serve on behalf should be treat fairly and equally now in term of how move forward think that the american people understand that be still dig way out of a pretty big mess.&nbsp so do not think anybody deny think be in a ditch.&nbsp just do not think feel like have get all the way out of the ditch yet.&nbsp and to move the analogy forward that use in the campaign think what want right now be the democrats and the republicans both push some more to get the car on level ground.&nbsp and have not do that & nbsp if think be engage in too much campaign rhetoric say the republicans be just sit on the side of the road watch get that car out of the ditch at the very least be push in opposite directions.&nbsp and so q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp the idea that policy be take the country in reverse.&nbsp just reject that idea altogether that policy could be go in reverse the and think look here ’s the bottom line.&nbsp when come into office this economy be in a freefall and the economy have stabilized.&nbsp the economy be growing.&nbsp have see nine|month of private sector job growth.&nbsp so think would be hard to argue that be go backwards.&nbsp think what can argue be be stick in neutral.&nbsp be not move the way need to to make sure that folk have the job have the opportunity be see economic growth in community the way need and that be go to require democrats and republicans to come together and look for the good idea to move thing forward will not be easy not just because democrats and republicans may have different priority as be just discuss when come to how structure tax cut but because these issue be hard & nbsp the republicans throughout the campaign say be very concerned about debt and deficits.&nbsp well of the most important thing can do for debt and deficit be economic growth.&nbsp so what other proposal do have to grow the economy if in fact be reject some of the proposal have make want to hear from what affirmative policy can make a difference in term of encouraging job growth and promote the economy because do not think that tax cut alone be go to be a recipe for the kind of expansion that need from|2001|to|2009 cut taxis pretty significantly and just do not see the kind of expansion that be go to be necessary in term of drive the unemployment rate down significantly so think what be go to need to do and what the american people want be for to mix and match idea figure out those area where can agree on move forward on those disagree without be disagreeable on those area that can not agree on.&nbsp if accomplish that then there will be time for politic later but over the|next|year think can solidify this recovery and give people a little more confidence out there hans|nichol q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp thank mr. president.&nbsp want to ask if be go to have john|boehner over for a slurpee but actually have a serious question the may serve be delicious drinks.&nbsp laughter & nbsp q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp the|slurpee|summit the the|slurpee|summit that ’s good chuck.&nbsp like that.&nbsp laughter & nbsp q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp since seem to be in a reflective mood do think need to hit the reset button with business?&nbsp how do plan to set that reset button with business would that would include anything beyond cleveland speech those proposal to get off the sideline get off the cash be hoarding and start hire again?&nbsp thank the yes think this be an important question that have be ask for several|month now.&nbsp be right as reflect on what ’s happen over the|last|two|year of the thing that think have not be manage by as well as need to be be find the right balance in make sure that business have rule of the road and be treat customer fairly and whether ’s credit card or insurance or mortgage but also make absolutely clear that the only way america succeed be if business be succeed & nbsp the reason have get a unparalleled standard of live in the history of the world be because have get a free market that be dynamic and entrepreneurial and that free market have to be nurture and cultivated.&nbsp and there ’s no doubt that when have the financial crisis on wall street the bonus controversy the battle around health care the battle around financial reform and then have bp just have a successive set of issue in which think business take the message that well gosh seem like may be always paint at the bad guy and so have get to take responsibility in term of make sure that make clear to the business community as well as to the country that the most important thing can do be to boost and encourage business sector and make sure that be hire and so do have specific plan in term of how can structure that outreach now keep in mind over the|last|two|year have be talk to ceo constantly.&nbsp and as plan for trip later|this|week to asia the whole focus be on how be go to open up market so that american business can prosper and can sell more good and create more job here in the united states.&nbsp and a whole bunch of corporate executive be go to be join so that can help open up those market and allow to sell product so there ’s be a lot of strong interaction behind the scenes.&nbsp but think set the right tone publicly be go to be important and could end up make a difference at the margin in term of how business make investment decision q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp but do have new specific proposal to get off the sideline and start hire the well already discuss a couple with chip that have not be act on yet be right that make these proposal two|months|ago but or but be in the midst of a campaign season where be doubtful that be go to get a full hearing just because there be so much political noise go on think as move forward sit down and talk to business figure out what exactly would help make more investment that could create more job here in the|united|state and listen hard to in a context where maybe democrats and republicans be together so be receive the same message at the same time and then act on that agenda could make a big difference matt|spetalnick of reuters & nbsp q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp thank mr. president.&nbsp how do respond to those who say the election outcome at least in part be voter say that see as out of touch with personal economic pain?&nbsp and be willing to make any change in leadership style the there be a inherent danger in be in the|white|house and be in the bubble.&nbsp mean folk do not have any complaint about leadership style when be run around iowa for a and get a pretty good look at up close and personal and be able to lift the hood and kick the tire and think understand that story be may have a funny name may have live in some different place but the value of hard work and responsibility and honesty and look out for another that have be instill in by parent those be the same value that take from mom and grandparent and so the track record have be that when be out of this place that be not an issue.&nbsp when be in this place be hard not to seem removed.&nbsp and of the challenge that have get to think about be how do meet responsibility here in the|white|house which require a lot of hour and a lot of work but still have that opportunity to engage with the american people on a day to day basis and know give confidence that be listen to those letter that read every|night some of just break heart.&nbsp some of provide encouragement and inspiration.&nbsp but nobody be film read those letters.&nbsp and so ’ hard think for people to get a sense of well how be take in all this information so think there be more thing that can do to make sure that be get out of

as iraqis have transition to lead responsibility for the security of country be now focused on build a lasting partnership with the iraqi people while keep commitment to remove the rest of troop by while draw down in iraq have refocus on defeat al|qaeda and deny affiliate a safe haven.&nbsp in afghanistan the|united|state and ally be pursue a strategy to break the taliban ’s momentum and build the capacity of afghanistan ’s government and security force so that a transition to afghan responsibility can begin next|july.&nbsp and from south|asia to the|horn|of|africa be move toward a more target approach one that strengthen partner and dismantle terrorist network without deploy large american army as pursue the world ’s most dangerous extremist be also deny the world ’s most dangerous weapon and pursue the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapon earlier|this|year nation embrace a work plan to secure all vulnerable nuclear material within years.&nbsp have join with

the|nuclear|non proliferation|treaty as part of effort on non - proliferation offer the|islamic|republic|of|iran an extended hand last|year and underscore that have both right and responsibility as a member of the international community.&nbsp also say in this hall that iran must be hold accountable if fail to meet those responsibilities.&nbsp and that be what have do iran be the only party to the npt that can not demonstrate the peaceful intention of nuclear program and those action have consequences.&nbsp through u.n. security council resolution make clear that international law be not an empty promise now let be clear once more:&nbsp the|united|state and the international community seek a resolution to difference with iran and the door remain open to diplomacy should iran choose to walk through but the iranian government must demonstrate a clear and credible commitment and confirm to the world the peaceful intent of nuclear program as combat the spread of deadly weapon be also confront the specter of climate change.&nbsp after make historic investment in clean energy and efficiency at home help forge an accord in copenhagen that for the first time commit all major economy

power of clean energy to serve as an engine of growth and development america have also embrace unique responsibility with come that come with power.&nbsp since the rain come and the floodwater rise in pakistan have pledge assistance and should all support the pakistani people as recover and rebuild.&nbsp and when the earth shake and haiti be devastate by loss join a coalition of nation in response.&nbsp today honor those from the u.n. family who lose life in the earthquake and commit to stand with the people of haiti until can stand on own two|feet amidst this upheaval have also be persistent in pursuit of peace.&nbsp last|year pledge good effort to support the goal of state israel and palestine live side by side in peace and security as part of a comprehensive peace between israel and all of neighbors.&nbsp have travel a winding road over the|last|12|month with few peak and many valleys.&nbsp but this|month be pleased that have pursue direct negotiation between israelis and palestinians in washington sharm|el|sheikh and jerusalem now recognize many be pessimistic about this process.&nbsp the cynic say that israelis and palestinians be too distrustful of each other and too divide internally to forge last peace.&nbsp rejectionist on both side will try to disrupt the process with bitter word and with bomb and with gunfire.&nbsp some say that the gap between the party be too big the potential for talk to break down be too great and that after decade of failure peace be simply not possible hear those voice of skepticism.&nbsp but ask to consider the alternative.&nbsp if an agreement be not reach palestinians will never know the pride and dignity that come with own state.&nbsp israelis will never know the certainty and security that come with sovereign and stable neighbor who be commit to coexistence.&nbsp the hard reality of demography will take hold.&nbsp more blood will be this|holy|land will remain a symbol of difference instead of common humanity.&nbsp refuse to accept that future.&nbsp and all have a choice to make.&nbsp each of must choose the path of peace.&nbsp of course that responsibility begin with the party who must answer the call of history.&nbsp at the|white|house be strike by the word of both the israeli and palestinian leaders.&nbsp prime minister netanyahu say come here today to find a historic compromise that will enable both people to live in peace security and dignity.”&nbsp and president abbas say will spare no effort and will work diligently and tirelessly to ensure these negotiation achieve cause these word must now be follow by action and believe that both leader have the courage to do so.&nbsp but the road that have to travel be exceedingly difficult which be why call upon israelis and palestinians and the world to rally behind the goal that these leader now share.&nbsp know that there will be test along the way and that test be fast approaching.&nbsp israel ’s settlement moratorium have make a difference on the ground and improve the atmosphere for talks.&nbsp and position on this issue be well known.&nbsp believe that the moratorium should be extended.&nbsp also believe that talk should press on until completed.&nbsp now be the time for the party to help each other overcome this obstacle.&nbsp now be the time to build the trust and provide the time for substantial progress to be made.&nbsp now be the time for this opportunity to be seize so that do not slip away now peace must be make by israelis and palestinians but each of have a responsibility to do part as well.&nbsp those of who be friend of israel must understand that true security for the jewish state require an independent palestine one that allow the palestinian people to live with dignity and opportunity.&nbsp and those of who be friend of the palestinians must understand that the right of the palestinian people will be win only through peaceful mean include genuine reconciliation with a secure israel know many in this hall count as friend of the palestinians.&nbsp but these pledge of friendship must now be support by deeds.&nbsp those who have sign on to the arab peace initiative should seize this opportunity to make real by take tangible step towards the normalization that promise israel.&nbsp and those who speak on behalf of palestinian self government should help the|palestinian|authority politically and financially and in do so help the palestinians build the institution of state.&nbsp those who long to see an independent palestine must also stop try to tear down israel.&nbsp after thousands|of|year jews and arabs be not stranger in a strange land.&nbsp after in the community of nation israel ’s existence must not be a subject for debate israel be a sovereign state and the historic homeland of the jewish people.&nbsp should be clear to all that effort to chip away at israel ’s legitimacy will only be meet by the unshakeable opposition of the united states.&nbsp and effort to threaten or kill israelis will do nothing to help the palestinian people.&nbsp the slaughter of innocent israelis be not resistance ’ injustice.&nbsp and make no mistake:&nbsp the courage of a man like president abbas who stand up for people in front of the world under very difficult circumstance be far great than those who fire rocket at innocent woman and child the conflict between israelis and arabs be as old as this institution.&nbsp and can come back here next|year as have for the|last|60|year and make long speech about it.&nbsp can read familiar list of grievances.&nbsp can table the same resolutions.&nbsp can further empower the force of rejectionism and hate.&nbsp and can waste more time by carry forward an argument that will not help a single israeli or palestinian child achieve a well life.&nbsp can do that.&nbsp or can say that this time will be different that this time will not let terror or turbulence or posturing or petty politic stand in the way.&nbsp this time will think not of but of the young girl in gaza who want to have no ceiling on dream or the young boy in sderot who want to sleep without the nightmare of rocket fire this time should draw upon the teaching of tolerance that lie at the heart of great religion that see jerusalem ’s soil as sacred.&nbsp this time should reach for what ’s best within ourselves.&nbsp if do when come back here next|year can have an agreement that will lead to a new member of the|united|nation an independent sovereign state of palestine live in peace with israel.&nbsp applause be destiny to bear the burden of the challenge that have address recession and war and conflict.&nbsp and there be always a sense of urgency even emergency that drive most of foreign policies.&nbsp indeed after millennia mark by war this very institution reflect the desire of human being to create a forum to deal with emergency that will inevitably come but even as confront immediate challenge must also summon the foresight to look beyond and consider what be try to build over the long term?&nbsp what be the world that await when today ’s battle be bring to an end?&nbsp and that be what would like to talk about with the remainder of time today of the first action of this|general|assembly be to adopt a universal|declaration|of|human|right in that declaration begin by state that “ recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable right of all member of the human family be the foundation of freedom justice and peace in the world the idea be a simple that freedom justice and peace for the world must begin with freedom justice and peace in the life of individual human beings.&nbsp and for the|united|state this be a matter of moral and pragmatic necessity.&nbsp as robert|kennedy say “ the individual man the child of god be the touchstone of value and all society group the state exist for benefit.”&nbsp so stand up for universal value because ’s the right thing to but also know from experience that those who defend these value for people have be close friend and ally while those who have deny those right whether terrorist group or tyrannical government have choose to be adversary human right have never go unchallenged not in any of nation and not in world.&nbsp tyranny be still with whether manifest in the taliban killing girl who try to go to school a north|korean regime that enslave own people or an armed group in congo kinshasa that use rape as a weapon of war in time of economic unease there can also be an anxiety about human rights.&nbsp today as in past time of economic downturn some put human right aside for the promise of short term stability or the false notion that economic growth can come at the expense of freedom.&nbsp see leader abolish term limits.&nbsp see crackdown on civil society.&nbsp see corruption smother entrepreneurship and good governance.&nbsp see democratic reform defer indefinitely as say last|year each country will pursue a path root in the culture of own people.&nbsp yet experience show that history be on the side of liberty that the strong foundation for human progress lie in open economy open society and open governments.&nbsp to put simply democracy more than any other form of government deliver for citizens.&nbsp and believe that truth will only grow strong in a world where the border between nation be blurred.&nbsp america be work to shape a world that foster this openness for the rot of a closed or corrupt economy must never eclipse the energy and innovation of human beings.&nbsp all of want the right to educate child to make a decent wage to care for the sick and to be carry as far as dream and deed will take us.&nbsp but that depend upon economy that tap the power of people include the potential of woman and girls.&nbsp that mean let entrepreneur start a business without pay a bribe and government that support opportunity instead of steal from people.&nbsp and that mean reward hard work instead of reckless risk taking yesterday put forward a new development policy that will pursue these goal recognize that dignity be a human right and global development be in common interest.&nbsp america will partner with nation that offer people a path out of poverty.&nbsp and together must unleash growth that power by individual and emerge market in all part of the globe there be no reason why africa should not be an exporter of agriculture which be why food security initiative be empower farmers.&nbsp there be no reason why entrepreneur should not be able to build new market in every society which be why host a summit on entrepreneurship earlier|this|spring because the obligation of government be to empower individual not to impede the same hold true for civil society.&nbsp the arc of human progress have be shape by individual with the freedom to assemble and by organization outside of government that insist upon democratic change and by free medium that hold the powerful accountable.&nbsp have see that from the south|african who stand up to apartheid to the|poles|of|solidarity to the mother of the disappear who speak out against the|dirty|war to americans who march for the right of all race include own civil society be the conscience of community and america will always extend engagement abroad with citizen beyond the hall of government.&nbsp and will call out those who suppress idea and serve as a voice for those who be voiceless.&nbsp will promote new tool of communication so people be empower to connect with another and in repressive society to do so with security.&nbsp will support a free and open internet so individual have the information to make up own minds.&nbsp and be time to embrace and effectively monitor norm that advance the right of civil society and guarantee expansion within and across border open society support open government but can not substitute for there be no right more fundamental than the ability to choose leader and determine destiny.&nbsp now make no mistake:&nbsp the ultimate success of democracy in the world will not come because the|united|states dictate will come because individual citizen demand a say in how be governed.&nbsp there be no soil where this notion can not take root just as every democracy reflect the uniqueness of a nation.&nbsp later|this|fall will travel to asia.&nbsp and will visit india which peacefully throw off colonialism and establish a thrive democracy of over a people will continue to indonesia the world ’s large muslim majority country which bind together thousand of island through the glue of representative government and civil society.&nbsp will join the g20 meet on the|korean|peninsula which provide the world ’s clear contrast between a society that be dynamic and open and free and one that be imprison and closed.&nbsp and will conclude trip in japan an ancient culture that find peace and extraordinary development through democracy each of these country give life to democratic principle in own way.&nbsp and even as some government roll back reform also celebrate the courage of a president in colombia who willingly step aside or the promise of a new constitution in kenya the common thread of progress be the principle that government be accountable to citizens.&nbsp and the diversity in this room make clear no country have all the answer but all of must answer to own people in all part of the world see the promise of innovation to make government more open and accountable.&nbsp and now must build on that progress.&nbsp and when gather back here next|year should bring specific commitment to promote transparency to fight corruption to energize civic engagement to leverage new technology so that strengthen the foundation of freedom in own country while live up to the ideal that can light the world this institution can still play an indispensable role in the advance of human rights.&nbsp ’s time to welcome the effort of u.n.|women to protect the right of woman around the globe.&nbsp applause ’s time for every member state to open election to international monitor and increase the u.n. democracy fund.&nbsp ’s time to reinvigorate u.n. peacekeeping so that mission have the resource necessary to succeed and so atrocity like sexual violence be prevent and justice be enforce because neither dignity nor democracy can thrive without basic security and ’s time to make this institution more accountable as well because the challenge of a|new|century demand new way of serve common interest the world that america seek be not can build on own.&nbsp for human right to reach those who suffer the boot of oppression need voice to speak out.&nbsp in particular appeal to those nation who emerge from tyranny and inspire the world in the|second|half|of|the|last|century from south|africa to south|asia from to do not stand idly by do not be silent when dissident elsewhere be imprison and protester be beaten.&nbsp recall own history.&nbsp because part of the price of own freedom be stand up for the freedom of other that belief will guide america ’s leadership in century.&nbsp be a belief that have see through more|than|two|centurie of trial and will see through the challenge face today be war or recession conflict or division so even as have come through a|difficult|decade stand here before confident in the future a future where iraq be govern by neither tyrant nor a foreign power and afghanistan be free from the turmoil of war a future where the child of israel and palestine can build the peace that be not possible for parent a world where the promise of development reach into the prison of poverty and disease a future where the cloud of recession give way to the light of renewal and the dream of opportunity be available to all this future will not be easy to reach.&nbsp will not come without setback nor will be quickly claimed.&nbsp but the founding of the|united|nation be a testament to human progress.&nbsp remember in time that be far more trying than own predecessor choose the hope of unity over the ease of division and make a promise to future generation that the dignity and equality of human being would be common cause & fall to to fulfill that promise.&nbsp and though will be meet by dark force that will test resolve americans have always have cause to believe that can choose a well history that need only to look outside the wall around us.&nbsp for through the citizen of every conceivable ancestry who make this city own see live proof that opportunity can be access by all that what unite as human being be far great than what divide and that people from every part of this world can live together in peace.&nbsp thank very much.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp view transcript transcript good evening.&nbsp tonight would like to talk to about the end of combat mission in iraq the ongoing security challenge face and the need to rebuild nation here at home.&nbsp know this historic moment come at a time of great uncertainty for many americans.&nbsp have now be through nearly|a|decade of war.&nbsp have endure a long and painful recession.&nbsp and sometimes in the midst of these storm the future that be try to build for nation a future of last peace and long term prosperity may seem beyond reach but this milestone should serve as a reminder to all americans that the future be ours to shape if move forward with confidence and commitment.&nbsp should also serve as a message to the world that the|united|states|of|america intend to sustain and strengthen leadership in this|young|century from this desk seven|and|a|half|years|ago president bush announce the beginning of military operation in iraq.&nbsp much have change since that night.&nbsp a war to disarm a state become a fight against an insurgency.&nbsp terrorism and sectarian warfare threaten to tear iraq apart.&nbsp thousand of americans give life tens|of|thousand have be relation abroad be strained.&nbsp unity at home be test these be the rough water encounter during the course of of america ’s long yet there have be constant amidst these shift tides.&nbsp at every turn america ’s man and woman in uniform have serve with courage and resolve.&nbsp as commander in chief be incredibly proud of service.&nbsp and like all americans be awe by sacrifice and by the sacrifice of family the americans who have serve in iraq complete every mission be given.&nbsp defeat a regime that have terrorize people.&nbsp together with iraqis and coalition partner who make huge sacrifice of own troop fight block by block to help iraq seize the chance for a well future.&nbsp shift tactic to protect the iraqi people train iraqi|security|force and take out terrorist leaders.&nbsp because of troop and civilian and because of the resilience of the iraqi people iraq have the opportunity to embrace a new destiny even though many challenge remain so tonight be announce that the american combat mission in iraq have operation|iraqi|freedom be over and the iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of country & this be pledge to the american people as a candidate for this office.&nbsp last|february announce a plan that would bring combat brigade out of iraq while redouble effort to strengthen iraq’s|security|force and support government and people.&nbsp that ’s what have done.&nbsp have remove nearly|100,000 u.s. troop from iraq.&nbsp have close or transfer to the iraqis hundred of bases.&nbsp and have move million of piece of equipment out of iraq this complete a transition to iraqi responsibility for own security.&nbsp u.s. troop pull out of iraq ’s city last|summer and iraqi force have move into the lead with considerable skill and commitment to fellow citizens.&nbsp even as iraq continue to suffer terrorist attack security incident have be near the low on record since the war began.&nbsp and iraqi force have take the fight to al|qaeda remove much of leadership in iraqi lead operation this|year also see iraq hold credible election that draw a strong turnout.&nbsp a caretaker administration be in place as iraqis form a government base on the result of that election.&nbsp tonight encourage iraq ’s leader to move forward with a sense of urgency to form an inclusive government that be just representative and accountable to the iraqi people.&nbsp and when that government be in place there should be no doubt:&nbsp the iraqi people will have a strong partner in the united states.&nbsp combat mission be end but commitment to iraq ’s future be not go forward a transitional force of u.s. troop will remain in iraq with a different mission:&nbsp advise and assist iraq’s|security|forces support iraqi troop in target counterterrorism mission and protect civilians.&nbsp consistent with agreement with the iraqi government all u.s. troop will leave by as military draw down dedicated civilian diplomat aid worker and advisor be move into the lead to support iraq as strengthen government resolve political dispute resettle those displace by war and build tie with the region and the world.&nbsp that ’s a message that vice president biden be deliver to the iraqi people through visit there today & this new approach reflect long term partnership with iraq base upon mutual interest and mutual respect.&nbsp of course violence will not end with combat mission.&nbsp extremist will continue to set off bomb attack iraqi civilian and try to spark sectarian strife.&nbsp but ultimately these terrorist will fail to achieve goals.&nbsp iraqis be a proud people.&nbsp have reject sectarian war and have no interest in endless destruction.&nbsp understand that in the end only iraqis can resolve difference and police streets.&nbsp only iraqis can build a democracy within borders.&nbsp what america can do and will do be provide support for the iraqi people as both a friend and a partner & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp end this war be not only in iraq ’s interest ’s in own.&nbsp the|united|states have pay a huge price to put the future of iraq in the hand of people.&nbsp have send young man and woman to make enormous sacrifice in iraq and spend vast resource abroad at a time of tight budget at home.&nbsp have persevere because of a belief share with the iraqi people a belief that out of the ashe of war a new beginning could be bear in this cradle of civilization.&nbsp through this remarkable chapter in the history of the|united|state and iraq have meet responsibility.&nbsp now ’s time to turn the page as do be mindful that the|iraq|war have be a contentious issue at home.&nbsp here too ’s time to turn the page.&nbsp this|afternoon speak to former president george|w.|bush.&nbsp ’s well know that and disagree about the war from outset.&nbsp yet no one can doubt president bush ’s support for troop or love of country and commitment to security.&nbsp as have say there be patriot who support this war and patriot who oppose and all of be unite in appreciation for serviceman and woman and hope for iraqis ’ future & the greatness of democracy be ground in ability to move beyond difference and to learn from experience as confront the many challenge ahead.&nbsp and no challenge be more essential to security than fight against al|qaeda & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp americans across the political spectrum support the use of force against those who attack on now as approach our|10th|year of combat in afghanistan there be those who be understandably ask tough question about mission there.&nbsp but must never lose sight of what ’s at stake.&nbsp as speak al|qaeda continue to plot against and leadership remain anchor in the border region of afghanistan and pakistan.&nbsp will disrupt dismantle and defeat al|qaeda while prevent afghanistan from again serve as a base for terrorists.&nbsp and because of drawdown in iraq be now able to apply the resource necessary to go on offense.&nbsp in fact over the|last|19|month nearly|a|dozen al|qaeda leader and hundred of al|qaeda ’s extremist ally have be kill or capture around the world within afghanistan have order the deployment of additional troop who under the command of general david|petraeus be fight to break the taliban ’s momentum.&nbsp;&nbsp as with the surge in iraq these force will be in place for a limited time to provide space for the afghans to build capacity and secure own future.&nbsp but as be the case in iraq can not do for afghans what must ultimately do for themselves.&nbsp that ’s why be training afghan|security|force and support a political resolution to afghanistan ’s problems.&nbsp and next|august will begin a transition to afghan responsibility.&nbsp the pace of troop reduction will be determine by condition on the ground and support for afghanistan will endure.&nbsp but make no mistake:&nbsp this transition will begin because open ended war serve neither interest nor the afghan people ’s & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp indeed of the lesson of effort in iraq be that american influence around the world be not a function of military force alone.&nbsp must use all element of power include diplomacy economic strength and the power of america ’s example to secure interest and stand by allies.&nbsp and must project a vision of the future that ’s base not just on fear but also on hope a vision that recognize the real danger that exist around the world,&nbsp but also the limitless possibility of time & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp today old adversary be at peace and emerge democracy be potential partners.&nbsp new market for good stretch from asia to the americas.&nbsp a new push for peace in the|middle|east will begin here tomorrow.&nbsp billion of young people want to move beyond the shackle of poverty and conflict.&nbsp as the leader of the free world america will do more than just defeat on the battlefield those who offer hatred and destruction will also lead among those who be willing to work together to expand freedom and opportunity for all people & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp now that effort must begin within own borders.&nbsp throughout history america have be willing to bear the burden of promote liberty and human dignity overseas understand link to own liberty and security.&nbsp but have also understand that nation ’s strength and influence abroad must be firmly anchor in prosperity at home.&nbsp and the bedrock of that prosperity must be a grow middle class & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp unfortunately over the|last|decade have not do what ’s necessary to shore up the foundation of own prosperity.&nbsp spend a|trillion|dollars at war often finance by borrow from overseas.&nbsp this in turn have short change investment in own people and contribute to record deficits.&nbsp for too long have put off tough decision on everything from manufacturing base to energy policy to education reform.&nbsp as a result too many middle class family find work harder for less while nation ’s long term competitiveness be put at risk & and so at this moment as wind down the war in iraq must tackle those challenge at home with as much energy and grit and sense of common purpose as man and woman in uniform who have serve abroad.&nbsp have meet every test that faced.&nbsp now ’ turn.&nbsp now ’ responsibility to honor by come together all of and work to secure the dream that so many generation have fight for the dream that a well life await anyone who be willing to work for and reach for & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp most urgent task be to restore economy and put the|million of americans who have lose job back to work.&nbsp to strengthen middle class must give all child the education deserve and all worker the skill that need to compete in a global economy.&nbsp must jumpstart industry that create job and end dependence on foreign oil.&nbsp must unleash the innovation that allow new product to roll off assembly line and nurture the idea that spring from entrepreneurs.&nbsp this will be difficult.&nbsp but in the|day to come must be central mission as a people and central responsibility as president & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp part of that responsibility be make sure that honor commitment to those who have serve country with such valor.&nbsp as long as be president will maintain the fine fighting force that the world have ever know and will do whatever take to serve veteran as well as have serve us.&nbsp this be a sacred trust.&nbsp that ’s why have already make of the large increase in funding for veteran in decades.&nbsp be treat the signature wound of today ’s war post - traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury while provide the health care and benefit that all of veteran have and be fund a gi bill that help veteran and family pursue the dream of a college education.&nbsp just as the gi bill help those who fight world|war|ii include grandfather become the backbone of middle class so today ’s serviceman and woman must have the chance to apply gift to expand the american economy.&nbsp because part of end a war responsibly be stand by those who have fight & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp two|weeks|ago america ’s final combat brigade in iraq the army ’s fourth stryker brigade journey home in the pre - dawn darkness.&nbsp thousand of soldier and hundred of vehicle make the trip from baghdad the last of pass into kuwait in the|early|morn over seven|years|before american troop and coalition partner have fight way across similar highway but this time no shot be be just a convoy of brave americans make way home & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp of course the soldier leave much behind.&nbsp some be teenager when the war began.&nbsp many have serve multiple tour of duty far from family who bear a heroic burden of own endure the absence of a husband ’s embrace or a mother ’s kiss.&nbsp most painfully since the war begin member of the|fourth|stryker|brigade make the ultimate sacrifice part of over americans who have give life in iraq.&nbsp as staff sergeant say know that to brother in arm who fight and die this|day would

the|united|states|of|america and all who serve view transcript transcript good evening.&nbsp as speak nation face a multitude of at home top priority be to recover and rebuild from a recession that have touch the life of nearly every american.&nbsp abroad brave man and woman in uniform be take the fight to al|qaeda wherever exists.&nbsp and tonight have return from a trip to the|gulf|coast to speak with about the battle be wag against an oil spill that be assault shore and citizen on april|20th an explosion rip through bp|deepwater|horizon drilling rig about|40|miles off the coast of louisiana.&nbsp worker lose lives.&nbsp other be and soon nearly|a|mile beneath the surface of the ocean oil begin spew into the water because there have never be a leak this size at this depth stop have test the limit of human technology.&nbsp that ’s why just after the rig sink assemble a team of nation ’s good scientist and engineer to tackle this challenge a team lead by dr. steven|chu a nobel|prize win physicist and nation ’s secretary of energy.&nbsp scientist at national lab and expert from academia and other oil company have also provide idea and advice as a result of these effort have direct bp to mobilize additional equipment and technology.&nbsp and in the|coming|weeks and day these effort should capture up|to|90|percent of the oil leak out of the well.&nbsp this be until the company finish drill a relief well later in the summer that ’s expect to stop the leak completely.&nbsp already this oil spill be the bad environmental disaster america have ever faced.&nbsp and unlike an earthquake or a hurricane ’s not a single event that do damage in a matter of minute or days.&nbsp the|millions|of|gallon of oil that have spill into be more like an epidemic that will be fight for month and even years.&nbsp but make no mistake:&nbsp will fight this spill with everything have get for as long as takes.&nbsp will make bp pay for the damage company have caused.&nbsp and will do whatever ’s necessary to help the|gulf|coast and people recover from this tragedy.&nbsp tonight would like to lay out for what battle plan be go forward:&nbsp what be do to clean up the oil what be do to help neighbor in the gulf and what be do to make sure that a catastrophe like this never happen again.&nbsp first the cleanup.&nbsp from the very beginning of this crisis the federal government have be in charge of the large environmental cleanup effort in nation ’s history an effort lead by admiral thad|allen who have almost|40|year of experience respond to disasters.&nbsp now have personnel who be work across state to contain and clean up the oil.&nbsp thousand of ship and other vessel be respond in the gulf.&nbsp and have authorize the deployment of over|17,000 national|guard member along the coast.&nbsp these serviceman and woman be ready to help stop the oil from come ashore be ready to help clean the beach train response worker or even help with processing claim and urge the governor in the affect state to activate these troop as soon as possible.&nbsp because of effort millions|of|gallon of oil have already be remove from the water through burn skim and other collection methods.&nbsp of boom have be lay across the water to block and absorb the approach oil.&nbsp have approve the construction of new barrier island in louisiana to try to stop the oil before reach the shore and be work with alabama mississippi and florida to implement creative approach to unique coastlines.&nbsp as the cleanup continue will offer whatever additional resource and assistance coastal state may need.&nbsp now a mobilization of this speed and magnitude will never be perfect and new challenge will always arise.&nbsp see and hear evidence of that during this trip.&nbsp so if something be not work want to hear about it.&nbsp if there be problem in the operation will fix them.&nbsp but have to recognize that despite good effort oil have already cause damage to coastline and wildlife.&nbsp and sadly no matter how effective response be there will be more oil and more damage before this siege be done.&nbsp that ’s why the second thing be focus on be the recovery and restoration of know for generation man and woman who call this region home have make living from the water.&nbsp that living be now in jeopardy.&nbsp have talk to shrimper and fisherman who do not know how be go to support family this year.&nbsp have see empty dock and restaurant with few customer even in area where the beach be not yet affected.&nbsp have talk to owner of shop and hotel who wonder when the tourist may start come back.&nbsp the sadness and the anger feel be not just about the money have lost.&nbsp ’s about a wrench anxiety that way of life may be lost.&nbsp refuse to let that happen.&nbsp tomorrow will meet with the chairman of bp and inform that be to set aside whatever resource be require to compensate the worker and business owner who have be harm as a result of company ’s recklessness.&nbsp and this fund will not be control by bp.&nbsp in order to ensure that all legitimate claim be pay out in a fair and timely manner the account must and will be administer by an independent third party.&nbsp beyond compensate the people of the gulf in the short term ’s also clear need a long term plan to restore the unique beauty and bounty of this region.&nbsp the oil spill represent just the late blow to a place that ’s already suffer multiple economic disaster and decade of environmental degradation that have lead to disappear wetland and habitats.&nbsp and the region still have not recover from hurricanes katrina and rita.&nbsp that ’s why must make a commitment to the|gulf|coast that go beyond respond to the crisis of the moment.&nbsp make that commitment tonight.&nbsp earlier ask ray|mabus the secretary of the navy who be also a former governor of mississippi and a son of the|gulf|coast to develop a long term gulf|coast|restoration|plan as soon as possible.&nbsp the plan will be design by state local community tribe fisherman business conservationist and other gulf residents.&nbsp and bp will pay for the impact this spill have have on the region.&nbsp;&nbsp the third part of response plan be the step be take to ensure that a disaster like this do not happen again.&nbsp a|few|months|ago approve a proposal to consider new limited offshore drilling under the assurance that would be absolutely safe –- that the proper technology would be in place and the necessary precaution would be take that obviously be not the case in the|deepwater|horizon rig and want to know why.&nbsp the american people deserve to know why.&nbsp the family meet with last|week who lose love one in the explosion these family deserve to know why.&nbsp and so have establish a national|commission to understand the cause of this disaster and offer recommendation on what additional safety and environmental standard need to put in place.&nbsp already have issue a month moratorium on deepwater drilling.&nbsp know this create difficulty for the people who work on these rig but for the sake of safety and for the sake of the entire region need to know the fact before allow deepwater drilling to continue.&nbsp and while urge the commission to complete work as quickly as possible expect to do that work thoroughly and place have already begin to take action be at the agency in charge of regulate drilling and issuing permit know as the minerals management service.&nbsp over the|last|decade this agency have become emblematic of a fail philosophy that view all regulation with hostility a philosophy that say corporation should be allow to play by own rule and police themselves.&nbsp at this agency industry insider be put in charge of industry oversight.&nbsp oil company shower regulator with gift and favor and be essentially allow to conduct own safety inspection and write own regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp when ken|salazar become secretary of the interior of very first act be to clean up the bad of the corruption at this agency.&nbsp but ’s now clear that the problem there run much deep and the pace of reform be just too slow.&nbsp and so secretary salazar and be bring in new leadership at the agency michael|bromwich who be a tough federal prosecutor and inspector general.&nbsp and charge over the|next|few|month be to build an organization that act as the oil industry ’s watchdog not partner.&nbsp so of the lesson have learn from this spill be that need well regulation well safety standard and well enforcement when come to offshore drilling.&nbsp but a large lesson be that no matter how much improve regulation of the industry drill for oil these|day entail great risk.&nbsp after all oil be a finite resource.&nbsp consume more|than|20|percent of the world ’s oil but have less|than|2|percent of the world ’s oil reserves.&nbsp and that ’s part of the reason oil company be drill a|mile beneath the surface of the ocean because be run out of place to drill on land and in shallow water.&nbsp for decade have know the day of cheap and easily accessible oil be for decade have talk and talk about the need to end america ’s century long addiction to fossil fuels.&nbsp and for decade have fail to act with the sense of urgency that this challenge requires.&nbsp time and again the path forward have be block not only by oil industry lobbyist but also by a lack of political courage and candor.&nbsp;&nbsp the consequence of inaction be now in plain sight.&nbsp country like china be invest in clean energy job and industry that should be right here in america.&nbsp each day send nearly|$1|billion of wealth to foreign country for oil.&nbsp and today as look to the gulf see an entire way of life be threaten by a menacing cloud of black crude can not consign child to this future.&nbsp the tragedy unfold on coast be the most painful and powerful reminder yet that the time to embrace a clean energy future be now.&nbsp now be the moment for this generation to embark on a national mission to unleash america ’s innovation and seize control of own destiny this be not some distant vision for america.&nbsp the transition away from fossil fuel be go to take some time but over have already take unprecedented action to jumpstart the clean energy industry.&nbsp as speak old factory be reopen to produce wind turbine people be go back to work instal energy efficient window and small business be make solar panels.&nbsp consumer be buy more efficient car and truck and family be make home more energy efficient.&nbsp scientist and researcher be discover clean energy technology that someday will lead to entire new industries.&nbsp each of have a part to play in a new future that will benefit all of us.&nbsp as recover from this recession the transition to clean energy have the potential to grow economy and create million of job but only if accelerate that transition.&nbsp only if seize the moment.&nbsp and only if rally together and act as nation –- worker and entrepreneur scientist and citizen the public and private sectors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp when be a candidate for this office lay out a set of principle that would move country towards energy independence.&nbsp last|year the|house|of|representative act on these principle by pass a strong and comprehensive energy and climate bill –- a bill that finally make clean energy the profitable kind of energy for america ’s businesses.&nbsp now there be cost associate with this transition.&nbsp and there be some who believe that can not afford those cost right now.&nbsp say can not afford not to change how produce and use energy because the long term cost to economy national security and environment be far greater.&nbsp so be happy to look at other idea and approach from either party as long seriously tackle addiction to fossil fuels.&nbsp some have suggest raise efficiency standard in building like do in car and trucks.&nbsp some believe should set standard to ensure that more of electricity come from wind and solar power.&nbsp other wonder why the energy industry only spend a fraction of what the high tech industry do on research and development and want to rapidly boost investment in such research and development.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp all of these approach have merit and deserve a fair hearing in the|month but the approach will not accept be inaction.&nbsp the answer will not settle for be the idea that this challenge be somehow too big and too difficult to meet.&nbsp know the same thing be say about ability to produce enough plane and tank in world|war|ii.&nbsp the same thing be say about ability to harness the science and technology to land a man safely on the surface of the moon.&nbsp and yet time and again have refuse to settle for the paltry limit of conventional wisdom.&nbsp instead what have define as a nation since founding be the capacity to shape destiny determination to fight for the america want for children.&nbsp even if be unsure exactly what that look like.&nbsp even if do not yet know precisely how be go to get there.&nbsp know will get there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ’ a faith in the future that sustain as a people.&nbsp be that same faith that sustain neighbor in the gulf right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp each year at the beginning of shrimp season the region ’s fisherman take part in a tradition that be bring to america long ago by fish immigrant from europe.&nbsp ’s call the|blessing|of|the|fleet and today ’ a celebration where clergy from different religion gather to say a prayer for the safety and success of the man and woman who will soon head out to sea some for week at a time.&nbsp;&nbsp the ceremony go on in good time and in bad.&nbsp take place after katrina and take place a|few|weeks|ago –- at the beginning of the most difficult season these fisherman have ever faced.&nbsp and still come and prayed.&nbsp for as a priest and former fisherman once say of the tradition the blessing be not that god have promise to remove all obstacle and dangers.&nbsp the blessing be that be with always a blessing that ’s grant “ even in the midst of the storm.”&nbsp the oil spill be not the last crisis america will face.&nbsp this nation have know hard time before and will surely know again.&nbsp what see through what have always see through –- be strength resilience and unyielding faith that something well await if summon the courage to reach for tonight pray for that courage.&nbsp pray for the people of the gulf.&nbsp and pray that a hand may guide through the storm towards a bright day.&nbsp thank god bless and may god bless the|united|states|of|america view transcript transcript thank very much.&nbsp everybody please have a seat.&nbsp thank very much.&nbsp well thank you.&nbsp be good to be back.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp be good to be back in new|york be good to be back in the|great|hall at applause.)&nbsp have get some special guest here that want to acknowledge.&nbsp congresswoman|carolyn|maloney be here in the house.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp governor david|paterson be here.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp attorney general andrew cuomo.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp state comptroller thomas|dinapoli be here.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp the mayor of new|york|city applause.)&nbsp dr. george|campbell jr. president of cooper union.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp and all the citywide elect official who be here.&nbsp thank very much for attendance be wonderful to be back in cooper|union where generation of leader and citizen have come to defend idea and contest differences.&nbsp ’s also good to be back in lower|manhattan a few block from wall street.&nbsp laughter.)&nbsp really be good to be back because wall street be the heart of nation ’s financial sector now since last speak here two|years|ago country have be through a terrible trial.&nbsp more|than|8|million people have lose jobs.&nbsp countless small business have have to shut doors.&nbsp trillions|of|dollar in saving have be lose force senior to put off retirement young people to postpone college entrepreneur to give up on the dream of start a company.&nbsp and as a nation be force to take unprecedented step to rescue the financial system and the broad economy and as a result of the decision make some of which let face be very unpopular be see hopeful signs.&nbsp a little more than year ago be lose an average of job each month.&nbsp today america be add job again.&nbsp one|year|ago the economy be shrink today the economy be growing.&nbsp in fact have see the fast turnaround in growth in nearly|three|decades but be here and be here because have get more work to until this progress be feel not just on wall street but on main|street can not be satisfied.&nbsp until the|million of neighbor who be look for work can find a job and wage be grow at a meaningful pace may be able to claim a technical recovery but will not have truly recovered.&nbsp and even as seek to revive this economy ’s also incumbent on to rebuild strong than before.&nbsp do not want an economy that have the same weakness that lead to this crisis.&nbsp and that mean address some of the underlie problem that lead to this turmoil and devastation in the first place now of the most significant contributor to this recession be a financial crisis as dire as any have know in generation at least since the and that crisis be bear of a failure of responsibility from wall street all the way to washington that bring down many of the world ’s large financial firm and nearly drag economy into a second great|depression be that failure of responsibility that speak about when come to new|york before the bad of the crisis have unfolded.&nbsp be back in and take no satisfaction in note that comment then have largely be bear out by the event that followed.&nbsp but repeat what say then because be essential that learn the lesson from this crisis so do not doom to repeat it.&nbsp and make no mistake that be exactly what will happen if allow this moment to pass and that ’s an outcome that be unacceptable to and ’s unacceptable to the american people.&nbsp applause as say on this stage two|years|ago believe in the power of the free market.&nbsp believe in a strong financial sector that help people to raise capital and get loan and invest savings.&nbsp that ’s part of what have make america what is.&nbsp but a free market be never mean to be a free license to take whatever can get however can get that ’s what happen too often in the|year lead up to this crisis.&nbsp some and let be clear not all but some on wall street forget that behind every dollar trade or leverage there ’s family look to buy a house or pay for an education open a business save for retirement.&nbsp what happen on wall street have real consequence across the country across economy have speak before about the need to build a new foundation for economic growth in the|21st and give the importance of the financial sector wall street reform be an absolutely essential part of that foundation.&nbsp without house will continue to sit on shift sand and family business and the global economy will be vulnerable to future crises.&nbsp that ’s why feel so strongly that need to enact a set of update commonsense rule to ensure accountability on wall street and to protect consumer in financial system.&nbsp applause now here ’s the good news:&nbsp a comprehensive plan to achieve these reform have already pass the house of representatives.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp a senate version be currently be debate draw on idea from democrat and republicans.&nbsp both bill represent significant improvement on the flawed rule that have in place today despite the furious effort of industry lobbyist to shape this legislation to special interest and for those of in the financial sector be sure that some of these lobbyist work for and be do what be be pay to but be here today specifically when speak to the titan of industry here because want to urge to join instead of fight in this effort.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp be here because believe that these reform be in the end not only in the good interest of country but in the good interest of the financial sector.&nbsp and be here to explain what reform will look like and why matter now first the bill be consider in the senate would create what do not have before and that be a way to protect the financial system and the broad economy and american taxpayer in the event that a large financial firm begin to if there’s|a|lehman or an aig how can respond in a way that do not force taxpayer to pick up the tab or alternatively could bring down the whole system in an ordinary local bank when approach insolvency have get a process an orderly process through the fdic that ensure that depositor be protect maintain confidence in the banking system and works.&nbsp customer and taxpayer be protect and owner and management lose equity.&nbsp but do not have that kind of process design to contain the failure of a lehman|brothers or any of the large and most interconnect financial firm in country & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp that ’s why when this crisis begin crucial decision about what would happen to some of the world ’s big company company employ tens|of|thousand of people and hold hundreds|of|billions|of|dollar in asset have to take place in hurried discussion in the middle of the night.&nbsp and that ’s why to save the entire economy from an even bad catastrophe have to deploy taxpayer dollars.&nbsp now much of that money have now be pay back and administration have propose a fee to be pay by large financial firm to recover all the money every dime because the american people should never have be put in that position in the first place.&nbsp applause but this be why need a system to shut these firm down with the least amount of collateral damage to innocent people and innocent businesses.&nbsp and from the start have insist that the financial industry not taxpayer shoulder the cost in the event that a large financial company should falter.&nbsp the goal be to make certain that taxpayer be never again on the hook because a firm be deem “ too big to fail now there ’s a legitimate debate take place about how good to ensure taxpayer be hold harmless in this process.&nbsp and that ’s a legitimate debate and encourage that debate.&nbsp but what ’s not legitimate be to suggest that somehow the legislation be propose be go to encourage future taxpayer bailout as some have claimed.&nbsp that make for a good sound bite but ’s not factually be not applause.)&nbsp in fact the system as stand the system as stand be what lead to a series of massive costly taxpayer and ’ only with reform that can avoid a similar outcome in the future.&nbsp in other word a vote for reform be a vote to put a stop to taxpayer fund bailouts.&nbsp that ’s the truth.&nbsp end of story.&nbsp and nobody should be fool in this|debate.&nbsp applause by the way these change have the add benefit of create incentive within the industry to ensure that no company can ever threaten to bring down the whole economy to that end the bill would also enact what ’s know as the|volcker|rule and there ’s a tall guy sit in the front row here paul|volcker applause who name after.&nbsp and do something very simple:&nbsp place some limit on the size of bank and the kind of risk that banking institution can take.&nbsp this will not only safeguard system against crisis this will also make system strong and more competitive by instill confidence here at home and across the globe.&nbsp market depend on that confidence.&nbsp part of what lead to the turmoil of the|past|two|year be that in the absence of clear rule and sound practice people do not trust that system be in which be safe to invest or lend.&nbsp as have see that harm all of so by enact these reform will help ensure that financial system and economy continue to be the envy of the world.&nbsp that ’s the first thing make sure that can wind down firm if get into trouble without bring the whole system down or force taxpayer to fund a bailout number reform would bring new transparency to many financial markets.&nbsp as know part of what lead to this crisis be firm like aig and other who be make huge and risky bet use derivative and other complicated financial instrument in way that defy accountability or even common sense.&nbsp in fact many practice be so opaque so confusing so complex that the people inside the firm do not understand them,&nbsp much less those who be charge with oversee them.&nbsp be not fully aware of the massive bet that be be placed.&nbsp that ’s what lead warren|buffett to describe derivative that be buy and sell with little oversight as financial weapon of mass destruction.”&nbsp that ’s what call them.&nbsp and that ’s why reform will rein in excess and help ensure that these kind of transaction take place in the light of day & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp now there ’s be a great deal of concern about these changes.&nbsp so want to reiterate:&nbsp there be a legitimate role for these financial instrument in can help allay risk and spur investment.&nbsp and there be a lot of company that use these instrument to that legitimate end be manage exposure to fluctuate price or currency fluctuate markets.&nbsp for example a business may hedge against rise oil price by buy a financial product to secure stable fuel cost so an airline may have an interest in lock in a decent price.&nbsp that ’s how market be suppose to work.&nbsp the problem be these market operate in the shadow of economy invisible to regulator invisible to the public.&nbsp so reckless practice be risk accrue until threaten entire financial system and that ’s why these reform be design to respect legitimate activity but prevent reckless risk taking.&nbsp that ’s why want to ensure that financial product like standardized derivative be trade out in the open in the full view of business investor and those charge with oversight and be encourage to see a republican senator join with democrats this|week in move forward on this issue.&nbsp that be a good sign.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp that be a good sign.&nbsp for without action will continue to see what amount to highly leverage loosely monitor gambling in financial system put taxpayer and the economy in jeopardy.&nbsp and the only people who ought to fear the kind of oversight and transparency that be propose be those whose conduct will fail this scrutiny third this plan would enact the strong consumer financial protection ever.&nbsp applause and that be absolutely necessary because this financial crisis be not just the result of decision make in the executive suite on wall street be also the result of decision make around kitchen table across america by folk who take on mortgage and credit card and auto loans.&nbsp and while ’s true that many americans take on financial obligation that know or should have know could not have afford million of other be frankly duped.&nbsp be mislead by deceptive term and condition bury deep in the fine print and while a few company make out like bandit by exploit customer entire economy be make more vulnerable.&nbsp million of people have now lose homes.&nbsp tens|of|million more have lose value in homes.&nbsp just about every sector of economy have feel the pain whether be pave driveway in arizona or sell house in ohio or be do home repair in california or be use home equity to start a small business in florida that ’s why need to give consumer more protection and more power in financial system.&nbsp this be not about stifle competition stifle innovation ’s just the opposite.&nbsp with a dedicated agency set ground rule and look out for ordinary people in financial system will empower consumer with clear and concise information when be make financial decisions.&nbsp so instead of compete to offer confusing product company will compete the old fashioned way by offer well products.&nbsp and that will mean more choice for consumer more opportunity for business and more stability in financial system.&nbsp and unless business model depend on bilk people there be little to fear from these new rules.&nbsp applause number the last key component of reform.&nbsp these wall street reform will give shareholder new power in the financial system.&nbsp will get what call a say on pay a voice with respect to the salary and bonus award to top executives.&nbsp and the sec will have the authority to give shareholder more say in corporate election so that investor and pension holder have a strong role in determine who manage the company in which have place saving now americans do not begrudge anybody for success when that success be but when read in the past and sometimes in the present about enormous executive bonus at firm even as be rely on assistance from taxpayer or be take huge risk that threaten the system as a whole or company be do badly offend fundamental value not only that some of the salary and bonus that have see create perverse incentive to take reckless risk that contribute to the crisis.&nbsp ’s what help lead to a relentless focus on a company ’s next|quarter to the detriment of next|year or next decade.&nbsp and lead to a situation in which folk with the most to lose stock and pension holder have the least to say in the process.&nbsp and that have to change.&nbsp applause let close by say this.&nbsp have lay out a set of wall street reforms.&nbsp these be reform that would put an end to taxpayer bailout that would bring complex financial dealing out of the shadow that would protect consumer and that would give shareholder more power in the financial system.&nbsp but let face also need reform in washington.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp and the debate the debate over these change be a perfect example mean have see battalion of financial industry lobbyist descend on capitol|hill firm spend million to influence the outcome of this|debate.&nbsp have see misleading argument and attack that be design not to improve the bill but to weaken or to kill it.&nbsp have see a bipartisan process buckle under the weight of these wither force even as we‘ve produce a proposal that by all account be a commonsense reasonable non - ideological approach to target the root problem that lead to the turmoil in financial sector and ultimately in entire economy & nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp so have see business as usual in washington but believe can and must put this kind of cynical politic aside.&nbsp have get to put an end to it.&nbsp that ’s why be here today.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp that ’s why be here today and to those of who be in the financial sector let say this will not always see eye to eye.&nbsp will not always agree.&nbsp but that do not mean that have get to choose between extremes.&nbsp do not have to choose between market that be unfettere by even modest protection against crisis or market that be stymie by onerous rule that suppress enterprise and innovation.&nbsp that be a false choice.&nbsp and need no more proof than the crisis that have just be through see there have always be a tension between the desire to allow market to function without interference and the absolute necessity of rule to prevent market from fall out of kilter.&nbsp but manage that tension that have debate since the founding of this nation be what have allow country to keep up with a change world.&nbsp for in take up this debate in figure out how to apply well wear principle with each new age ensure that do not tip too far way or the other that democracy remain as dynamic and economy remain as dynamic as have in the past.&nbsp so yes this debate can be contentious.&nbsp can be but in the end serve only to make country stronger.&nbsp have allow to adapt and to thrive and read a report recently that think fairly illustrate this point.&nbsp ’s from time magazine.&nbsp be go to quote:&nbsp through the great banking house of manhattan last|week run wild eyed alarm.&nbsp big banker stare at another in anger and astonishment.&nbsp a bill just pass … would rivet upon institution what consider a monstrous system such a system feel would not only rob of pride of profession but would reduce all u.s. banking to low level.”&nbsp that appear in time|magazine in june of laughter and applause.)&nbsp the system that cause so much consternation so much concern be the|federal|deposit|insurance|corporation also know as the fdic an institution that have successfully secure the deposit of generation of americans in the end system only work market be only free when there be basic safeguard that prevent abuse that check excesse that ensure that be more profitable to play by the rule than to game the system.&nbsp and that be what the reform have be propose be design to achieve no more no less.&nbsp and because that be how will ensure that economy work for consumer that work for investor and that work for financial institution in other word that work for all of that ’s why be work so hard to get this stuff pass this be the central lesson not only of this crisis but of history.&nbsp ’ what say when speak here two|year ago.&nbsp because ultimately there be no dividing line between main|street and wall street.&nbsp will rise or will fall together as nation.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp and that be why urge all of to join me.&nbsp urge all of to join to join those who be seek to pass these commonsense reforms.&nbsp and for those of in the financial industry urge to join not only because be in the interest of industry but also because ’s in the interest of country thank so much.&nbsp god bless and god bless the|united|state of america.&nbsp thank you.&nbsp applause view transcript transcript thank everybody thank

laughter think that be very cool and lead the world to space help america achieve new height of prosperity here on earth while demonstrate the power of a free and open society to harness the ingenuity of people and on a personal note have be part of that generation so inspire by the space program be the|year of birth the|year that kennedy make announcement and of early memory be sit on grandfather ’s shoulder wave a flag as astronaut arrive in hawaii for the space program have always capture an essential part of what mean to be an american reach for new height stretch beyond what previously do not seem possible and so as president believe that space exploration be not a luxury ’s not an afterthought in america ’s quest for a bright future be an essential part of that quest so today would like to talk about the next chapter in this story the challenge face space program be different and imperative for this program be different than in decade past be no longer race against an adversary be no longer compete to achieve a singular goal like reach the moon in fact what be once a global competition have long since become a global collaboration but while the measure of achievement have change a great deal over what do or fail to do in seek new frontier be no less consequential for future in space and here on earth so let start by be extremely clear i|am|100|percent commit to the mission of nasa and future applause because broaden capability in space will continue to serve society in way that can scarcely imagine because exploration will once more inspire wonder in a new generation spark passion and launch career and because ultimately if fail to press forward in the pursuit of discovery be cede future and be cede that essential element of the american character know there have be a number of question raise about administration ’s plan for space exploration especially in this part of florida where so many rely on nasa as a source of income as well as a source of pride and community and these question come at a time of transition as the space shuttle near scheduled retirement after almost|30|year of service and understandably this add to the worry of folk concern not only about own future but about the future of the space program to which have devote lives.&nbsp but also know that underlie these concern be a deep worry that precede not only this plan but this administration stem from the sense that people in washington drive sometimes less by vision than by politic have for year neglect nasa ’s mission and undermine the work of the professional who fulfill have see that in the nasa budget which have rise and fall with the political winds.&nbsp but can also see in other way in the reluctance of those who hold office to set clear achievable objective to provide the resource to meet those objective and to justify not just these plan but the large purpose of space exploration in the|21st all that have to change and with the strategy be outline today will start by increase nasa ’s budget by over the|next|five|year even applause want people to understand the context of this this be happen even as have institute a freeze on discretionary spending and seek to make cut elsewhere in the budget.&nbsp so nasa from the start when issue budget be of the area where do not just maintain a freeze but actually increase funding by by do that will ramp up robotic exploration of the solar system include a probe of the sun ’s atmosphere new scout mission to mars and other destination and an advanced telescope to follow hubble allow to peer deeper into the universe than ever before.&nbsp will increase earth base observation to improve understanding of climate and world science that will garner tangible benefit help to protect environment for future generations.&nbsp and will extend the life of the|international|space|station likely by more|than|five|year while actually use for intended purpose conduct advanced research that can help improve the daily life of people here on earth as well as testing and improve upon capability in space this include technology like more efficient life support system that will help reduce the cost of future mission and in order to reach the space station will work with a grow array of private company compete to make get to space easy and more affordable applause.)&nbsp now recognize that some have say be unfeasible or unwise to work with the private sector in this way disagree the truth be nasa have always rely on private industry to help design and build the vehicle that carry astronaut to space from the mercury capsule that carry john|glenn into orbit nearly|50|years|ago to the space shuttle discovery currently orbit overhead by buy the service of space transportation rather than the vehicle can continue to ensure rigorous safety standard be meet but will also accelerate the pace of innovation as company from young startup to establish leader compete to design and build and launch new mean of carry people and material out of atmosphere.&nbsp in addition as part of this effort will build on the good work already do on the orion crew capsule have direct charlie|bolden to immediately begin develop a rescue vehicle use this technology so be not force to rely on foreign provider if become necessary to quickly bring people home from the|international|space|station and this orion effort will be part of the technological foundation for advanced spacecraft to be use in future deep space mission in fact orion will be readie for flight right here in this room applause.)&nbsp next will invest more|than|$3|billion to conduct research on an advanced heavy lift rocket a vehicle to efficiently send into orbit the crew capsule propulsion system and large quantity of supply need to reach deep space in develop this new vehicle will not only look at revise or modify old model want to look at new design new material new technology that will transform not just where can go but what can do when get there and will finalize a rocket design no later than and then begin to build applause and want everybody to understand that ’s at|least|two|years|earlier than previously plan and that ’s conservative give that the previous program be behind schedule and over budget.&nbsp at the same time after decade of neglect will increase investment right away in other groundbreake technology that will allow astronaut to reach space sooner and more often to travel farther and faster for less cost and to live and work in space for long period of time more safely that mean tackle major scientific and technological challenge how do shield astronaut from radiation on long mission how do harness resource on distant world how do supply spacecraft with energy need for these far reach journey these be question that can answer and will answer and these be the question whose answer no doubt will reap untold benefit right here on earth.&nbsp so the point be what be look for be not just to continue on the same path want to leap into the future want major breakthrough a transformative agenda for nasa applause.)&nbsp now yes pursue this new strategy will require that revise the old strategy in part this be because the old strategy include the constellation program be not fulfil promise in many way that ’s not just assessment that ’s also the assessment of a panel of respected non - partisan expert charge with look at these issue closely now despite this some have have harsh word for the decision have make include some individual who have get enormous respect and admiration for.&nbsp but what hope be be that everybody will take a look at what be plan consider the detail of what have lay out and see the merit as have describe the bottom line be nobody be more committed to manned space flight to human exploration of space than be applause but have get to do in a smart way and can not just keep on do the same old thing that have be do and think that somehow be go to get to where want to go.&nbsp some have say for instance that this plan give up leadership in space by fail to produce plan within nasa to reach low earth orbit instead of rely on company and other country but will actually reach space faster and more often under this new plan in way that will help improve technological capacity and lower cost which be both essential for the long term sustainability of space flight in fact through plan will be send many more astronaut to space over applause.)&nbsp there be also those who criticize decision to end part of constellation as that will hinder space exploration below sic low earth orbit but ’s precisely by invest in groundbreake research and innovative company that will have the potential to rapidly transform capability even as build on the important work already complete through project like orion for future mission and unlike the previous program be set a course with specific and achievable milestones.&nbsp early in a set of crew flight will test and prove the system require for exploration beyond low earth orbit applause and by expect new spacecraft design for long journey to allow to begin the first ever crew mission beyond the moon into deep space applause so will start will start by send astronaut to an asteroid for the first time in history applause by the|mid-2030s believe can send human to orbit mars and return safely to earth and a landing on mars will follow and expect to be around to see applause.)&nbsp but want to repeat want to repeat this critical to deep space exploration will be the development of breakthrough propulsion system and other advanced technology so be challenge nasa to break through these barrier and will give the resource to break through these barrier and know will with ingenuity and intensity because that ’s what have always do applause.)&nbsp now understand that some believe that should attempt a return to the surface of the moon first as previously plan but just have to say pretty bluntly here have be there before buzz have be there there ’s a lot more of space to explore and a lot more to learn when do so believe ’s more important to ramp up capability to reach and operate at a series of increasingly demand target while advance technological capability with each step forward and that ’s what this strategy do and that ’s how will ensure that leadership in space be even strong in this|new|century than be in the last applause.)&nbsp finally want to say a few word about job suzanne point out to that the last time be here make a very clear promise that would help in the transition into a new program to make sure that people who be already go through a tough time here in this region be help and despite some report to the contrary plan will add more|than|2,500 job along the|space|coast in the|next|two|year compare to the plan under the previous administration so want to make that point applause.)&nbsp be go to modernize the|kennedy|space|center create job as upgrade launch facility and there ’s potential for even more job as company in florida and across america compete to be part of a new space transportation industry and some of those industry leader be here today this hold the promise of generate more|than|10,000 job nationwide over the|next|few|year and many of these job will be create right here in florida because this be an area prim to lead in this competition.&nbsp now ’s true there be floridians who will see work on the shuttle end as the program wind down this be base on a decision that be make six|years|ago not six|months|ago but that do not make any less painful for family and community affect as this decision become reality.&nbsp so be propose in part because of strong lobbying by bill and by suzanne as well as charlie be propose a initiative lead by a high level team from the|white|house nasa and other agency to develop a plan for regional economic growth and job creation and expect this plan to reach desk by august|15th applause ’ an effort that will help prepare this already skilled workforce for new opportunity in the space industry and beyond.&nbsp so this be the next chapter that can write together here at nasa will partner with industry will invest in cutting edge research and technology will set far reach milestone and provide the resource to reach those milestone and step by step will push the boundary not only of where can go but what can do.&nbsp fifty|year after the creation of nasa goal be no longer just a destination to reach goal be the capacity for people to work and learn and operate and live safely beyond the earth for extended period of time ultimately in way that be more sustainable and even indefinite and in fulfil this task will not only extend humanity ’s reach in space will strengthen america ’s leadership here on earth.&nbsp now will close by say this know that some americans have ask a question that ’s particularly apt on tax|day why spend money on nasa at all why spend money solve problem in space when do not lack for problem to solve here on the ground and obviously country be still reel from the bad economic turmoil have know in generation have massive structural deficit that have to be close in the come years.&nbsp but and know this be a false choice have to fix economy need to close deficit but for penny on the dollar the space program have fuel job and entire industry for penny on the dollar the space program have improve life advance society strengthen economy and inspire generation of americans and have no doubt that nasa can continue to fulfill this role applause but that be why but want to say clearly to those of who work for nasa but to the entire community that have be so supportive of the space program in this area that be exactly why ’s so essential that pursue a new course and that revitalize nasa and mission not just with dollar but with clear aim and a large purpose.&nbsp now little more|than|40|years|ago astronaut descend the rung ladder of the lunar module call eagle and allow foot to touch the dusty surface of the earth ’s only moon this be the culmination of a daring and perilous gambit of an endeavor that push the boundary of knowledge of technological prowess of very capacity as human being to solve problem be not just the great achievement in nasa ’s history be of the great achievement in human history.&nbsp and the question for now be whether that be the beginning of something or the end of something choose to believe be only the beginning.&nbsp so thank god bless and may god bless thank applause.)&nbsp view transcript transcript the hello ohio!&nbsp applause.)&nbsp be good to be here in the buckeye state.&nbsp congratulation on win the big championship.&nbsp laughter.)&nbsp be fill out bracket now.&nbsp laughter.)&nbsp and ’s even well to be out of washington for a little while o h i o. the yes that kid turner look pretty good.&nbsp guy be do all right be wonderful to be here audience love the love back.&nbsp do.&nbsp applause couple of people just want to make sure give special mention first of all already see governor ted|strickland in the house.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp ted be fight every day to bring job and economic development to ohio so be terrific united|stat senator sherrod|brown.&nbsp love|sherrod|brown.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp own congressman who be tireless on behalf of work people applause audience member:&nbsp vote yes the do hear that dennis?&nbsp go ahead say that again audience member:&nbsp vote yes the a couple member of congress be here:&nbsp u.s. representative applause.)&nbsp u.s. representative applause.)&nbsp u.s. representative tim|ryan.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp u.s. representative applause want to thank mayor tom|perciak here in strongsville.&nbsp please mr. mayor be on.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp that be a good bunch of folk get here in ohio work hard.&nbsp which be why be glad to be back and let face ’s nice to be out of washington once in a while.&nbsp laughter want to thank connie want to thank connie who introduce me.&nbsp want to thank and family for be here on behalf of sister natoma.&nbsp do not know if everybody understand that natoma be in the hospital right now so connie be fill ’s not easy to share such a personal story when sister who love so much be sick.&nbsp and so appreciate connie be willing to do so here today and applause and want everybody to understand that connie and sister be the reason that be here today.&nbsp applause see connie feel be important that sister ’s story be told.&nbsp but want to just repeat what happen here.&nbsp last|month get a letter from connie ’s sister natoma.&nbsp ’s self employ ’s try to make end meet and for year ’s do the responsible thing just like most of have.&nbsp buy insurance do not have a big employer who provide insurance so buy health insurance through the individual market and be important for to have insurance because be diagnose with a treatable form of cancer.&nbsp and even though have be cancer free for more|than|a|decade the insurance company keep on jack up rate year after so increase out of pocket expenses.&nbsp raise deductible.&nbsp do everything could to maintain health insurance that would be there just in case get sick because figure do not want to be do not want to be in a position where if do get sick somebody else would have to pick up the tab that would have to go to the emergency room that the cost would be shift onto folk through high insurance premium or hospital charge high rates.&nbsp so try to do the right thing and up deductible last|year to the minimum sic the high possible deductible.&nbsp but despite that natoma ’s insurance company raise premium by more|than|25 percent.&nbsp and over the|past|year pay in monthly premium boo the pay more|than|$4,000 in out of pocket medical cost for co - pay and medical care and prescriptions.&nbsp so all together this woman pay but because never hit deductible insurance company only spend on care.&nbsp so the insurance company be make get pay out now what come in the mail at audience|member:&nbsp a bill audience|member:&nbsp a rate hike the ’ a letter tell natoma that premium would go up again by more|than|40|percent boo the so here ’s what happens.&nbsp just could not afford it.&nbsp do not have the money.&nbsp realize that if pay those health insurance premium that have be jack up by could not make mortgage.&nbsp and despite desire to keep coverage despite fear that would get sick and lose the home that parent build finally surrender finally give up health insurance.&nbsp stop pay could not make end meet so january be last|month of be like so many responsible americans folk who work hard every|day who try to do the right thing be force to hang fortune on chance.&nbsp to take a chance that ’s all could do.&nbsp hope against hope that would stay healthy.&nbsp fear terribly that may not stay healthy that be the letter that read to the insurance company include the person responsible for raise rates.&nbsp now understand natoma be pretty surprised when find out that have read to these ceos.&nbsp but think be important for to understand the human dimension of this problem.&nbsp rate have be hike more|than|40|percent and this be less|than|two|weeks ago.&nbsp unfortunately natoma ’s bad fear be realized.&nbsp and just|last|week be work on a nearby farm walk outside apparently chase after a cow laughter when collapsed.&nbsp and be rush to the hospital.&nbsp be very sick.&nbsp need blood transfusions.&nbsp doctor perform a battery of tests.&nbsp and on saturday natoma be diagnose with leukemia now the reason natoma be not here today be that ’s lie on a hospital bed suddenly face with this emergency suddenly face with the fight of life.&nbsp expect to face more|than|a|month of aggressive chemotherapy.&nbsp be rack with worry not only about illness but about the cost of the test and the treatment that ’s surely go to need to beat so want to know why be here be here because of natoma.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp be here because of the countless other who have be force to face the most terrifying challenge in life with the add burden of medical bill can not pay.&nbsp do not think that ’s right.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp neither do you.&nbsp that ’s why need health insurance right now.&nbsp health insurance reform right now.&nbsp applause obama!&nbsp obama!&nbsp obama!&nbsp obama the be here because of own mother ’s story.&nbsp die of cancer and in the|last|six|month of life be on the phone in hospital room argue with insurance company instead of focus on get well and spend time with family be here because of the million who be deny coverage because of preexist condition or drop from coverage when get sick.&nbsp applause be here because of the small business who be force to choose between health care and hiring.&nbsp applause be here because of the senior unable to afford the prescription that need.&nbsp applause be here because of the folk see premium go up and and and in a year.&nbsp applause ohio be here because that be not the america believe in and that ’s not the america that believe in audience what ’s plan the so when hear people say “ start over no the want to think about|natoma.&nbsp when hear people say that this be not the “ right time think about what ’s go through.&nbsp when hear people talk about well what do this mean for the democrats?&nbsp what do this mean for the republicans?&nbsp do not know how the poll be doing.&nbsp when hear people more worried about the politic of than what ’s right and what ’s wrong want to think about natoma and the million of people all across this country who be look for some help and look for some relief.&nbsp that ’s why need health insurance reform right now.&nbsp applause part of what make this issue difficult be most of do have health insurance still and so and so kind of feel like well do not know ’s kind of work for be not worry too much.&nbsp but what have to understand be that what ’s happen to natoma there but for the grace of god go any of us.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp anybody here if lose job right now and after the cobra run out audience member faint the look like have get somebody who might have faint down there so if have get a medic.&nbsp no no no.&nbsp hold on.&nbsp be talk about there ’s somebody who might have faint right down here so if can get a medic just back here.&nbsp be probably okay.&nbsp just give or some space audience member:&nbsp hope have insurance.&nbsp laughter the so let just think about think about if lose job right now.&nbsp how many people here may have have a preexist condition that would mean would be very hard to get health insurance on the individual market?&nbsp think about if want to change jobs.&nbsp think about if want to start own business but suddenly have to give up health insurance on job.&nbsp think about what happen if a child of heaven forbid get diagnose with something that make hard for to insure for so many people may not be a problem right now but ’s go to be a problem later at any point.&nbsp and even if have get good health insurance what ’s happen to premiums?&nbsp what ’s happen to co - payments?&nbsp what ’s happen to deductible?&nbsp be all go that ’s money straight out of pocket so the bottom line be this:&nbsp the status quo on health care be simply unsustainable.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp can not have can not have a system that work better for the insurance company than do for the american people.&nbsp applause and know what will happen if fail to act.&nbsp know that government will be plunge deeper into debt.&nbsp know that million more people will lose coverage.&nbsp know that rise cost will saddle million more family with unaffordable expenses.&nbsp and a lot of small business be just go to drop coverage altogether.&nbsp that ’s already what ’s be happen a study come out just yesterday this be a nonpartisan study ’s find that without reform premium could more than double for individual and family over the|next|decade.&nbsp family policy could go to an average of or can afford that no the think employer can afford that no the employer can not sustain that.&nbsp so what ’s go to happen be be basically more and more of be just go to say know what?&nbsp be on own on this have debate this issue now for more than a every proposal have be put on the table.&nbsp every argument have be made.&nbsp know a lot of people view this as a partisan issue but look the fact be both party have a lot of area where agree ’s just politic be get in the way of actually get done.&nbsp applause somebody ask what ’s plan.&nbsp let describe exactly what be do because have end up with a proposal that incorporate the good idea from democrats and republicans even though republicans do not give any credit.&nbsp laughter.)&nbsp that ’s all right know if think about the debate around health care reform there be some who want to scrap the system of private insurance and replace with government run care.&nbsp and look that work in a number of place but do not see that be practical to help right away for people who really need and on the other end of the spectrum and this be what a lot of the republicans be say right now there be those who simply believe that the answer be to unleash the insurance industry to deregulate further provide less oversight and few rule boo the this be call the fox guard the henhouse approach to health insurance reform.&nbsp laughter.)&nbsp so what would do be would give insurance company more leeway to raise premium more leeway to deny care.&nbsp would segment the market further.&nbsp would be good if be rich and would save money.&nbsp but if be an ordinary person if get old if get a little sicker would be pay more now do not believe should give the government or insurance company more control over health care in america.&nbsp believe ’s time to give the american people more control over own health insurance.&nbsp applause and that ’s what proposal does.&nbsp proposal build on the current system where most americans get health insurance from employer.&nbsp so if like plan can keep plan.&nbsp if like doctor can keep doctor.&nbsp do not want to interfere with people ’s relationship between and doctor essentially here ’s what proposal would change:&nbsp thing about the current health care system but important thing number would end the bad practice of the insurance companies.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp all right?&nbsp this be like a patient ’s bill of right on steroids.&nbsp laughter.)&nbsp within the|first|year of sign health care reform thousand of uninsured americans with preexist condition will be able to purchase health insurance for the first time in life or the first time since get sick.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp this|year insurance company will be ban forever from deny coverage to child with preexist conditions.&nbsp so parent can have a little bit of security.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp this|year under this legislation insurance company will be ban from drop coverage when get sick.&nbsp those practice would end.&nbsp applause with this reform package all new insurance plan would be require to offer free preventive care to customer start this|year so free check up to catch preventable disease on the front end.&nbsp that ’s a smart thing to applause.)&nbsp start this|year if buy a new plan there will not be lifetime or restrictive annual limit on the amount of care receive from insurance company so will not be surprise by the fine print that say suddenly have stop pay and now suddenly be or or out of pocket.&nbsp that will not that will not happen if this become law this year.&nbsp applause see see some young people in the audience.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp if be an uninsured young adult will be able to stay on parent ’ policy until be 26|years|old under this law.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp so number number be insurance reform.&nbsp the second thing that this plan would change about the current system be this:&nbsp for the first time uninsured individual small business would have the same kind of choice of private health insurance that member of congress get for themselves.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp understand if this reform become law member of congress will be get insurance from the same place that the uninsured get because if ’s good enough for the american people ’s good enough for the people who send to washington.&nbsp applause so basically what would happen be would set up a pool of people million of people across the country would all buy into these pool that give more negotiating power.&nbsp if work for a big company have get a well insurance deal because have get more bargaining power as a whole.&nbsp want to have all the bargaining power that the federal employee have that big company have so will be able to buy in or a small business will be able to buy into this pool.&nbsp and that will lower rate ’s estimate by up to over what be currently getting.&nbsp that ’s money out of pocket and what proposal say be if still can not afford the insurance in this new marketplace then be go to offer tax credit to do so.&nbsp and that will add up to the large middle class tax cut for health care in history.&nbsp that ’s what be go to applause now when be talk about this at that health care summit some of see sit there for about|seven|hours know guy watch the whole thing.&nbsp laughter.)&nbsp but some of these folk say well just that ’s a nice idea but just can not afford to do that.&nbsp look want everybody to understand the wealthy among can already buy the good insurance there the least well among the poor among get health care through medicaid.&nbsp so ’s the middle class ’s work people that be get squeeze and that ’s who have to help and can afford to do it.&nbsp applause now be true that provide these tax credit to middle class family and small business that ’s go to cost some money.&nbsp ’s go to cost about|$100|billion per but most of this come from the nearly|$2.5|trillion a|year that americans already spend on health care.&nbsp ’s just right now a lot of that money be be spend badly so with this plan be go to make sure the dollar make the dollar that spend on health care be go to make insurance more affordable and more secure.&nbsp and be go to eliminate wasteful taxpayer subsidy that currently go to insurance company.&nbsp insurance company be make billions|of|dollar on subsidy from the taxpayer.&nbsp and if take those subsidy away can use to help folk like natoma get health insurance so do not lose house.&nbsp applause and yes will set a new fee on insurance company because stand to gain million more customer who be buy insurance.&nbsp there ’s nothing wrong with give something back.&nbsp but here ’s the bottom line:&nbsp proposal be pay for which by the way be more than can be say for colleague on the other side of the aisle when pass that big prescription drug plan that cost about as much as health care plan and do not pay for any of and go straight to the deficit.&nbsp and now be up there on high horse talk about well do not want to expand the deficit.&nbsp this plan do not expand the deficit.&nbsp plan expand the deficit.&nbsp that ’s why pay for what do.&nbsp that ’s the responsible thing to applause now so let talk about the third thing which be proposal would bring down the cost of health care for family for business and for the federal government.&nbsp so americans buy comparable coverage to what have today already say this would see premium fall by that ’s not number that ’s what the nonpartisan congressional|budget|office say for americans who get insurance through the workplace.&nbsp how many people be get insurance through job right now?&nbsp raise hands.&nbsp all right.&nbsp well a lot of those folk employer ’s estimate would see premium fall by as|much|as|3,000|percent sic which mean could give a raise.&nbsp applause have incorporate most of the serious idea from across the political spectrum about how to contain the rise cost of health care.&nbsp go after waste and abuse in the system especially in medicare.&nbsp cost cut measure would reduce most people ’s premium and bring down deficit by up to a&nbsp dollar over decades.&nbsp those be not numbers.&nbsp those be the number determine by be the referee.&nbsp that ’s what say not what say now the opponent of reform have try to make a lot of different argument to stop these changes.&nbsp remember.&nbsp first say well there ’s a government takeover of health care.&nbsp well that be not true.&nbsp well that be not true.&nbsp then say well what about death panels?&nbsp well that turn out that do not turn out to be true know the most insidious argument be make be the idea that somehow this would hurt medicare.&nbsp know have get some senior here with today could not tell guy look great.&nbsp laughter.)&nbsp would not have guessed.&nbsp but want to tell directly:&nbsp this proposal add almost|a|decade of solvency to medicare.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp this proposal would close the gap in prescription drug coverage call the doughnut hole know something about that that stick senior with thousands|of|dollar in drug costs.&nbsp this proposal will over time help to reduce the cost of medicare that pay every month.&nbsp this proposal would make preventive care free so do not have to pay out of pocket for test to keep healthy.&nbsp applause so yes be go after the waste the fraud the abuse in medicare.&nbsp be eliminate some of the insurance subsidy that should be go to care.&nbsp that ’s because these dollar should be spend on care for senior not on the care and feeding of the insurance company through sweetheart deals.&nbsp and every senior should know there be no cutting of guarantee medicare benefits.&nbsp period.&nbsp no “ ifs and or buts.”&nbsp applause.)&nbsp this proposal make medicare strong make the coverage better and make the finance more secure.&nbsp and anybody who say otherwise be either misinform or be try to misinform you.&nbsp do not let hoodwink you.&nbsp be try to hoodwink you.&nbsp laughter so look ohio that ’s the proposal.&nbsp and believe congress owe the american people a final up or down vote.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp need an up or down vote.&nbsp ’s time to vote.&nbsp and now as get close to the vote there be a lot of hand wringing go on.&nbsp hear a lot of people in washington talk about politic talk about what this mean in november talk about the poll number for democrats and republicans audience need courage the need courage.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp do hear what somebody just said?&nbsp applause.)&nbsp that ’s what need.&nbsp that ’s why come here today.&nbsp need courage.&nbsp applause need courage.&nbsp know in the end this debate be about far more than politics.&nbsp come down to what kind of country do want to be.&nbsp ’s about|the|million of life that would be touch and in some case save by make health insurance more secure and more affordable.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp ’ about a woman who ’s lie in a hospital bed who just want to be able to pay for the care needs.&nbsp and the truth be what ’s at stake in this debate ’s not just ability to solve this problem ’s about ability to solve any problem be talk to dennis|kucinich on the way over here about this.&nbsp say know what?&nbsp ’s be such a long time since make government on the side of ordinary working folk applause where do something for that relieve some of struggle that make folk who work hard every day and be do the right thing and who be look out for the family and contribute to community that just give a little bit of a well chance to live out american dream the american people want to know if ’s still possible for washington to look out for these interest for future.&nbsp so what be look for be some courage.&nbsp be wait for to act.&nbsp be wait for to lead.&nbsp do not want put finger out to the wind.&nbsp do not want read polls.&nbsp want to look and see what be the good thing for america and then do what ’s right.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp and as long as hold this office intend to provide that leadership.&nbsp and know these member of congress be go to provide that leadership.&nbsp do not know about the politic but know what ’s the right thing to and so be call on congress to pass these reform and be go to sign into law.&nbsp want some courage.&nbsp want to do the right thing ohio.&nbsp and with help be go to make happen god bless and god bless the|united|state of america.&nbsp applause view transcript transcript the hello everybody.&nbsp be glad to see that all of brave the weather to be here.&nbsp a little while ago have a meeting with the democratic and republican congressional leader and go very well.&nbsp in fact understand that mcconnell and reid be out do snow angel on the|south|lawn together.&nbsp laughter.)&nbsp can picture that chuck?&nbsp not really the meeting do go well and appreciate make the trek.&nbsp have a good and frank conversation and be one that hope can continue on a more regular basis all understand that there be legitimate and genuine difference between the party but despite the political posturing that often paralyze this town there be many issue upon which can and should agree.&nbsp that be what the american people be demand of us.&nbsp think be tired of every|day be election|day in washington.&nbsp and at this critical time in country the people send here expect a seriousness of purpose that transcend petty politic that be why be go to continue to seek the good idea from either party as work to tackle the press challenge ahead.&nbsp be confident for example that when in of fellow citizen can not work should be able to come together and help business create more jobs.&nbsp ought to be able to agree on provide small business with additional tax credit and much need line of credit.&nbsp ought to agree on investment in crumble road and bridge and should agree on tax break for make home more energy efficient all of which will put more americans to work.&nbsp many of the job proposal that have lay out have pass the house and be soon go to be debate in the senate.&nbsp spend a lot of time in this meeting discuss a job package and how could move forward on that.&nbsp and if there be additional idea will consider as well.&nbsp what will not consider be do nothing in the face of a lot of hardship across the country.&nbsp also talk about restore fiscal responsibility.&nbsp there be few matter on which there be as much vigorous bipartisan agreement at least in public but unfortunately there be also a lot of partisan wrangling behind closed doors.&nbsp this be what know for sure:&nbsp for to solve this extraordinary problem that be so many year in the making be go to take the cooperation of both parties.&nbsp be not go to happen in any other way be pleased that congress support request to restore the pay as go rule which be instrumental in turn deficit into surplus during the have also call for a bipartisan fiscal commission.&nbsp unfortunately this measure which originally have receive the support of a bipartisan majority of the senate and be cosponsor by senators conrad and gregg democrats and republicans be block so be go to be create this commission by executive order.&nbsp and during meeting ask the leadership of both party to join in this serious effort to address long term deficit because when the politic be put aside the reality of fiscal challenge be not subject to interpretation.&nbsp math be not there ought to be a debate about how to close deficits.&nbsp what can not accept be business as usual and can not afford grandstand at the expense of actually get something do during meeting also touch briefly on how can move forward on health reform.&nbsp have already announce that in two|week will be hold a meeting with people from both party and as tell the congressional leadership be look forward to a constructive debate with plan that need to be measure against this test.&nbsp do bring down cost for all americans as well as for the federal government which spend a huge amount on health care?&nbsp do provide adequate protection against abuse by the insurance industry?&nbsp do make coverage affordable and available to the tens|of|million of work americans who do not have right now?&nbsp and do help get on a path of fiscal sustainability also talk about why this be so urgent.&nbsp just|this|week there be a report that anthem|blue|cross which be the large insurer in the large state california be plan on raise premium for many individual policyholder by as|much|as|39|percent.&nbsp if do not act this be just a preview of come attractions.&nbsp premium will continue to rise for folk with insurance million more will lose coverage altogether deficit will continue to grow larger.&nbsp and have an obligation both party to tackle this issue in a serious way.&nbsp now bipartisanship depend on a willingness among both democrats and republicans to put aside matter of party for the good of the country.&nbsp will not hesitate to embrace a good idea from friend in the minority party but also will not hesitate to condemn what consider to be obstinacy that be root not in substantive disagreement but in political expedience.&nbsp talk about this as well particularly when come to the confirmation process.&nbsp respect the senate 's role to advise and consent but for month qualified non- controversial nominee for critical position in government often position relate to national security have be hold up despite have overwhelming support.&nbsp nominee for important job the head of general|services|administration which help run the government be deny a vote for nine|months.&nbsp when finally get a vote on nomination be confirm to that be not advise and consent that be delay and obstruct senator as all be aware have put a hold on every single nominee that have put forward due to a dispute over a couple of earmark in state.&nbsp in meeting ask the congressional leadership to put a stop to these hold in which nominee for critical job be deny a vote for months.&nbsp surely can set aside partisanship and do what be traditionally be do to confirm these nominations.&nbsp if the senate do not act and make this very clear if the senate do not act to confirm these nominee will consider make several recess appointment during the upcoming recess because can not afford to allow politic to stand in the way of a well function government hope be that this will be the first of a series of meeting that have with leadership of both party in congress.&nbsp have get to get past the tired debate that have plague politic and leave behind nothing but soar debt and mount challenge great hardship among the american people and extraordinary frustration among the american people.&nbsp those frustration be what lead to run for president and as long as be here in washington intend to try to make this government work on behalf so know be go to take a couple of question guy major q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp after meet with john|boehner come out and tell the house can not pass the health care bill once pass the senate can not pass the health care bill once passed.&nbsp why would have a conversation about legislation that can not pass?"&nbsp as a part of that say and white|house and congressional democrats should start over entirely from scratch on health care reform.&nbsp how do respond?&nbsp be willing to do that the well here be how respond to john in the meeting and have say this publicly before.&nbsp there be some core goal that have to be met.&nbsp have get to control cost both for family and business but also for government.&nbsp everybody out there who talk about deficit have to acknowledge that the single big driver of deficit be health care spending.&nbsp can not deal with deficit and debt long term unless get a handle on that.&nbsp so that have to be part of a package number have get to deal with insurance abuse that affect million of americans who have get health insurance.&nbsp and number have get to make health insurance more available to folk in the individual market as just mention in california who be suddenly see premium go up that apply to the majority of small business as well as sole proprietors.&nbsp be struggle so have get these goals.&nbsp now have a package as work through the difference between the house and the senate and will put up on a web site for all to see over a long period of time that meet those criterion meet those goals.&nbsp but when be in baltimore talk to the house republicans indicate can accomplish some of these goal at no cost.&nbsp and say great let see it.&nbsp and have no interest in do something that be more expensive and hard to accomplish if somebody else have an easy way to do it.&nbsp so be go to be start from scratch in the sense that will be open to any idea that help promote these goals.&nbsp what will not do what do not think make sense and do not think the american people want to see would be another year of partisan wrangle around these issue another|six|months|or|eight|months|or|nine|month worth of hearing in every single committee in the house and the senate in which there be a lot of posturing.&nbsp let get the relevant party together let put the good idea on the table.&nbsp hope be that can find enough overlap that can say this be the right way to move forward even if do not get every single thing that want but here be the point that make to john|boehner and bipartisanship can not be that agree to all the thing that believe in or want and agree to none of the thing believe in and want and that be the price of bipartisanship right?&nbsp but that be sometimes the way get presented.&nbsp mitch|mcconnell say something very nice in the meeting about how support goal on nuclear energy and clean coal technology and more drilling to increase oil production.&nbsp well of course like that that be part of the republican agenda for energy which accept.&nbsp and be willing to move off some of the preference of party in order to meet halfway.&nbsp but there be get to be some give from side as well.&nbsp that be true on health care that be true on energy that be true on financial reform.&nbsp that be what be hope get accomplish at the summit q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp do agree the house and senate bill can not pass anymore the what agree with be that the public have sour on the process that see over the last year.&nbsp think that actually contaminate how view the substance of the bills.&nbsp think be important for all of these issue to be air so that people have confidence if be move forward on such a significant part of the economy as health care that there be complete transparency and all of these issue have be adequately vet and adequately debate and this give an opportunity not just for democrats to say here be what think should do but also give republicans a showcase before the entire country to say here be plan here be why think this will work.&nbsp and of the thing that john|boehner and mitch|mcconnell both say be do not think that the status quo be acceptable and that be right there promising.&nbsp that indicate that if all side agree that can not just continue with business as usual then maybe can actually get something do q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp mr. president of the reason anthem say anthem|blue|cross say that be raise premium be because so many people be drop out of individual coverage because the economy be so bad and that leave the people in the pool who be people who need medical care drive up costs.&nbsp of the reason why business be not expand right now in addition to some of the credit issue have talk about at least accord to business leader be say there be an uncertainty of what need to plan for because of the energy bill because of health care.&nbsp that be what say.&nbsp be not say be true or not but that be what say.&nbsp what do say when hear that the well think that the big uncertainty have be just go through the bad recession since the|great|depression and people be not sure whether the financial system be go to melt down and whether be go to tip into a endless recession.&nbsp so let be clear about the source of uncertainty in term of business investment over the last several years:&nbsp a huge contraction trillions|of|dollar of loss in people 's people have a lot of debt come out of the|previous|decade that still have not work out the housing market lose a whole bunch of value.&nbsp so the good news be that where be contract by the economy be now grow by the ceo talk to be say be now make investment and anticipate that be go to start hire at a more rapid clip.&nbsp what have also hear be say that would like to feel like washington be work and able to get some thing done.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp there be way of interpret the issue of uncertainty.&nbsp way would be to say well know what will just go back to what be do before on let say the financial markets.&nbsp will not have the regulation that need will not make any change in term of too big to that will provide certainty until the next financial crisis.&nbsp that be not the kind of certainty think that the financial market need.&nbsp the kind of certainty need be for to go ahead and agree on a bipartisan effort to put some rule of the road in place so that consumer be protect in the financial market so that do not have bank that be too big to fail that have way of wind down and protect the overall system without taxpayer bailouts.&nbsp that require legislation.&nbsp the sooner can get that do the well the same would be true when come to health care.&nbsp a lot of ceo hear from will say boy would like to get health care settle way or another but will acknowledge that when open up late invoice for premium and find out that those premium have go up or that be the kind of uncertainty that also tamp down business investment so guess answer would be this:&nbsp the sooner the business community have a sense that have get act together here in washington and can move forward on big serious issue in a substantive way without a lot of posturing and partisan wrangling think the well off the entire country be go to be.&nbsp absolutely agree on that what think be important be not to buy into this notion that be perpetrate by some of the business interest that get a stake in this who be fight financial reform for example to say boy would be do fine if just do not try to regulate the banks.&nbsp that think would be a mistake q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp just to play devil 's advocate on that a small business let say not somebody who be go to be affect by the regulatory reform small business have propose would acknowledge a bold agenda.&nbsp and a small business may wonder do not know how the energy bill be go to affect do not know how the health care reform bill be go to affect would better hold off on hire the the small business talk to and have be talk to a lot of as have be travel around the country over big problem be right now can not get credit out of bank so be uncertain about that.&nbsp and be still uncertain about order do just have enough customer to justify do more be look well at this point.&nbsp but that be not the rationale for people say be not hiring.&nbsp let put this way.&nbsp most small business right now if have get enough customer to make a profit and can get the bank loan require to boost payroll boost inventory and sell to those customer will do so.&nbsp okay let see let get a print guy here.&nbsp david q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp hear mcconnell talk about nuclear power offshore drilling free trade that be a lot of republican stuff.&nbsp be party go to go for that if decide to support that the know think that on energy there should be a bipartisan agreement that have to take a both and approach rather than an either or approach.&nbsp what do mean by that be very firm in conviction that the country that lead the way in clean energy solar wind biodiesel geothermal that country be go to win the race in the|21st|century global economy.&nbsp so have to move in that direction what be also true be that give energy need in order to continue economic growth produce job make sure business be competitive around the world that be go to need some of the old traditional energy source as be develop these new one and ramp up.&nbsp so can not overnight convert to an all solar or an all wind that just can not happen.&nbsp be go to have need in these traditional source and so the question then be be go to be able to put together a package that include safe secure nuclear power that include new technology so that can use coal which have in abundance and be very cheap but often be add to greenhouse gas can find sequestration technology that clean that up can identify opportunity to increase oil and natural gas production in a way that be environmentally sustainable?&nbsp and that should be part of a package with development of clean energy and hope be that republican friend but also democrats say to let be practical and let do both.&nbsp let not just do or the other let do both.&nbsp over time think the transition be go to be more and more clean energy and over time fossil fuel become less prominent in overall energy mix.&nbsp but have get to do both q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp how confident be there will be that kind of consensus for that double edge approach the be just a eternal optimist laughter and so be the right thing to and all can do be just to keep on make the argument about what be right for the country and assume that over time people regardless of party regardless of particular political position be go to gravitate towards the truth.&nbsp okay be go to take more.&nbsp let see q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp how about the back?&nbsp laughter the well just want to make sure that be get a balance here so go ahead chuck q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp awwww the why be everybody moan about todd q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp be too good.&nbsp question be too precise.&nbsp laughter q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp iran get the news today that be do more of these try to enhance this uranium even obviously secretary gates today in paris be quote as say basically the dialogue seem to be over and now the question be sanctions.&nbsp where be on sanctions?&nbsp how close be this?&nbsp know have sort of an end of the year deadline when stand up there with sarkozy and brown.&nbsp be now february.&nbsp how quickly be this move along the well be move along fairly quickly.&nbsp think that have bend over backwards to say to the|islamic|republic|of|iran that be willing to have a constructive conversation about how can align with international norm and rule and reenter as full member of the international community the most obvious attempt be when give an offer that say be go to provide the conversion of some of the low enrich uranium that already have into the isotope that need for medical research and for hospital that would serve up|to|a|million iranian citizens.&nbsp reject although of the difficulty in deal with iran over the|last|several|months be be not always clear who be speak on behalf of the government and get a lot of different mixed signals.&nbsp but what be clear be be that have not say yes to an agreement that russia china germany france great|britain and the|united|stat all say be a good deal and that the director of the iaea say be the right thing to do and that iran should accept that indicate to that despite posturing that nuclear power be only for civilian use that in fact continue to pursue a course that would lead to weaponization.&nbsp and that be not acceptable to the international community not just to the united states.&nbsp so what have say from the start be be move on dual tracks.&nbsp if want to accept the kind of agreement with the international community that lead down a path of be a member of good standing then welcome you.&nbsp if not q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp have not respond though?&nbsp mean by decide to do what do with these the well be get to that.&nbsp q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp okay the and if not then the next step be sanctions.&nbsp have make choice so far although the door be still open.&nbsp and what be go to be work on over the|next|several|weeks be develop a significant regime of sanction that will indicate to how isolated be from the international community as a whole q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp what do mean by “ regime of sanction the well mean that there be go to be a q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp some will be u.n. and some will be the be go to be look at a variety of way in which country indicate to iran that approach be unacceptable.&nbsp and the u.n. will be aspect of that broad effort q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp china will be there?&nbsp be confident the well the be confident right now that the international community be unify around iran 's misbehavior in this area.&nbsp how china operate at the|security|council as pursue sanction be something that be go to have to see.&nbsp thing be pleased about be to see how forward lean the russians have be on this issue.&nbsp think clearly have see that iran have not be serious about solve what be a solvable dispute between iran and the international community all right?&nbsp be go to make this the last question.&nbsp and will take somebody from the back yes q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp the yes q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp thank for do this.&nbsp be be a while.&nbsp laughter.)&nbsp on health care the republicans be ask whether the february|25th session will include economist and public interest group and people support side or will just be the member of congress?&nbsp and on anthem|blue|cross do have the authority to go in and tell a private company can not charge that how will stop the well do not have the authority as understand can not simply issue an executive order lower everybody 's rates.&nbsp if could would have do that already and save a lot of grief on capitol|hill.&nbsp that be why reform be so important.&nbsp that be why the status quo be unacceptable.&nbsp but there be no shortcut in deal with this issue.&nbsp know the american people get frustrate in debate something like health care because get a whole bunch of different claim be make by different group and different interests.&nbsp be a big complicated tough issue.&nbsp but what be also true be that without some action on the part of congress be very unlikely that see any improvement over the current trajectory.&nbsp and the current trajectory be premium keep on go up percent.&nbsp the current trajectory be more and more people be lose health care do not know if people note because during the health care debate everybody be say the president be try to take over a government takeover of health care.&nbsp do not know if anybody notice that for the first time this|year see more people get health care from government than do from the private sector not because of anything do but because more and more people be lose health care from employers.&nbsp be become unaffordable.&nbsp that be what be try to prevent.&nbsp want people to be able to get health care from employers.&nbsp but also understand that have get to fix the system so that people be able to get at affordable rate and small business can afford to give employee insurance at an affordable rate.&nbsp and that be not happen right now to question about the 25th hope be that this do not end up be political theater as think some of have phrase want a substantive discussion.&nbsp have not refine exactly how the agenda be go to go that day.&nbsp want to talk with both the democratic and republican leader to find out what think would be most useful.&nbsp do want to make sure that there be some people like the|congressional|budget|office for example that be consider non - partisan who can answer questions.&nbsp in this whole health care debate be remind of the story that be tell about senator moynihan who be guess in an argument with of colleague and colleague be lose the argument so get a little flustered and say to senator moynihan well be entitled to own and senator moynihan say well be entitle to own opinion but be not entitled to own think that be the key to a successful dialogue on the|25th or on health care let establish some common facts.&nbsp let establish what the issue be what the problem be and let test out in front of the american people what idea work and what idea don't.&nbsp and if can establish that factual accuracy about how different approach would work then think can make some progress.&nbsp and may be that some of the fact that come up be one that make party a little bit uncomfortable.&nbsp so if be establish that by work seriously on medical malpractice and tort reform that can reduce some of those cost have say from the beginning of this debate would be willing to work on that.&nbsp on the other hand if be tell that that be only a fraction of the problem and that be not the big driver of health care cost then be also go to insist okay let look at that as aspect of but what else be willing to do and this be where get back to the point be make earlier.&nbsp bipartisanship can not mean simply that democrats give up everything that believe in find the handful of thing that republicans have be advocate for and do those thing and then have bipartisanship.&nbsp that be not how work in any other realm of life.&nbsp that be certainly not how work in marriage with michelle although usually do give in most of the time.&nbsp laughter.)&nbsp but the there be get to be some give and take and that be what be hope can be accomplished.&nbsp and be confident that be what the american people be look for so all right?&nbsp q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp the okay since there be not a job question q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp well just the will make this the last one job question q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp at the stakeout the republicans be say well the job package have see be not really ready yet be a little worried about the cost.&nbsp be satisfied that there be something that can be quickly move through congress on job the well understanding be first of all the house have move forward a job package that have some good element in it.&nbsp understanding be be that there be bipartisan talk take place as speak on the senate side about some element of a package think there be some thing that a lot of people agree on.&nbsp just to give an example the idea of eliminate capital gain for small business something can all agree on.&nbsp talk about at the|state|of|the|union address.&nbsp hope would be that would all agree on a mechanism to get community bank who be lend to small business more capital because that be something that keep on hearing be of the big problem that small business have out there so think that be realistic for to get a package move quickly that may not include all the thing think need to be do and may be that that first package build some trust and confidence that democrats and republicans on capitol|hill can work together and then move on to the next aspect of the package and so forth.&nbsp may take a series of incremental step but the thing be absolutely clear about be be that have get an economy that be grow right now a huge boost in productivity that be the good news.&nbsp the bad news be be that company still have not take that final step in actually put people on payroll full time be see an increase in temporary worker but have not yet take on that full time worker.&nbsp and so provide some additional impetus to right as the economy be move in a positive direction think can end up yield some good result all right?&nbsp thank guys.&nbsp that be pretty good thank view transcript transcript madam speaker vice president biden members of congress distinguished guest and fellow americans constitution declare that from time to time the president shall give to congress information about the state of union for leader have fulfil this duty have do so during period of prosperity and tranquility and have do so in the midst of war and depression at moment of great strife and great struggle be tempting to look back on these moment and assume that progress be inevitable that america be always destine to succeed but when the union be turn back at bull|run and the allies first land at omaha|beach victory be very much in doubt when the market crash on black|tuesday and civil right marcher be beat on bloody|sunday the future be anything but certain these be the time that test the courage of conviction and the strength of union and despite all division and disagreement hesitation and fear america prevail because choose to move forward as nation as people again be test and again must answer history 's call one|year|ago take office amid war an economy rock by a severe recession a financial system on the verge of collapse and a government deeply in debt expert from across the political spectrum warn that if do not act may face a second depression so act immediately and aggressively and the bad of the storm have pass but the devastation remain in americans still can not find work many business have shutter home value have decline small town and rural community have be hit especially hard and for those who have already know poverty life be become that much harder this recession have also compound the burden that america 's family have be deal with for decade the burden of work harder and longer for less of be unable to save enough to retire or help kid with college so know the anxiety that be out there right now be not new these struggle be the reason run for president these struggle be what have witness for year in place like elkhart indiana galesburg illinois hear about in the letter that read each|night the tough to read be those write by child ask why have to move from home ask when mom or dad will be able to go back to work for these americans and so many other change have not come fast enough some be frustrated some be angry do not understand why seem like bad behavior on wall street be reward but hard work on main|street be not or why washington have be unable or unwilling to solve any of problem be tired of the partisanship and the shouting and the pettiness know can not afford not now so face big and difficult challenge and what the american people hope what deserve be for all of democrats and republicans to work through difference to overcome the numbing weight of politic for while the people who send here have different background different story different belief the anxiety face be the same the aspiration hold be share a job that pay the bill a chance to get ahead most of all the ability to give child a well life and know what else share share a stubborn resilience in the face of adversity after of the most difficult year in history remain busy building car and teaching kid start business and go back to school be coach and help neighbor woman write to and say be strained but hopeful struggle but encouraged be because of this spirit this great decency and great strength that have never be more hopeful about america 's future than be tonight despite hardship union be strong do not give up do not quit do not allow fear or division to break spirit in this|new|decade be time the american people get a government that match decency that embody strength and tonight would like to talk about how together can deliver on that promise begin with economy most urgent task upon take office be to shore up the same bank that help cause this crisis be not easy to do and if there be thing that have unify democrats and republicans and everybody in between be that all hate the bank bailout hate hate hate be about as popular as a root canal.&nbsp but when run for president promise would not just do what be popular would do what be necessary and if have allow the meltdown of the financial system unemployment may be double what be today more business would certainly have close more home would have surely be lose so support the last administration 's effort to create the financial rescue program and when take that program over make more transparent and more accountable and as a result the market be now stabilize and have recover most of the money spend on the bank most but not all to recover the rest have propose a fee on the big bank now know wall street be not keen on this idea but if these firm can afford to hand out big bonus again can afford a modest fee to pay back the taxpayer who rescue in time of need now as stabilize the financial system also take step to get economy grow again save as many job as possible and help americans who have become unemployed that be why extend or increase unemployment benefit for americans make health insurance cheap for family who get coverage through cobra and pass different tax cut now let repeat cut taxis cut taxis for of work family cut taxis for small business cut taxis for first time home buyer cut taxis for parent try to care for child cut taxis for americans pay for college think would get some applause on that one.&nbsp as a result million of americans have more to spend on gas and food and other necessity all of which help business keep more worker and have not raise income taxis by a single dime on a single person — not a single dime now because of the step take there be americans work right now who would otherwise be unemployed two|hundred|thousand work in construction and clean energy three|hundred|thousand be teacher and other education worker tens|of|thousand be cop firefighter correctional officer first responder and be on track to add another job to this total by the|end|of|the|year the plan that have make all of this possible from the tax cut to the job be the|recovery|act that be right the|recovery|act also know as the stimulus bill economist on the left and the right say this bill have help save job and avert disaster but do not have to take word for talk to the small business in phoenix that will triple workforce because of the|recovery|act talk to the window manufacturer in philadelphia who say use to be skeptical about the|recovery|act until have to add more work shift just because of the business create talk to the single teacher raise kid who be tell by principal in of school that because of the|recovery|act would not be lay off after all there be story like this all across america and after of recession the economy be grow again retirement fund have start to gain back some of value business be begin to invest again and slowly some be start to hire again but realize that for every success story there be other story of man and woman who wake up with the anguish of not know where next paycheck will come from who send out resume week after week and hear nothing in response that be why job must be number focus in and that be why be call for a new job bill tonight now the true engine of job creation in this country will always be america 's business agree absolutely but government can create the condition necessary for business to expand and hire more worker should start where most new job do in small business company that begin when an entrepreneur take a chance on a dream or a worker decide be time become own boss through sheer grit and determination these company have weather the recession and be ready to grow but when talk to small business owner in place like allentown pennsylvania or elyria ohio find out that even though bank on wall street be lend again be mostly lend to big company financing remain difficult for small business owner across the country even those that be make a profit so tonight be propose that take of the money wall street bank have repay and use to help community bank give small business the credit need to stay afloat be also propose a new small business tax credit that will go to over|1|million small business who hire new worker or raise wage while be at let also eliminate all capital gain taxis on small business investment and provide a tax incentive for all large business and all small business to invest in new plant and equipment next can put americans to work today build the infrastructure of tomorrow from the first railroad to the|interstate|highway|system nation have always be build to compete there be no reason europe or china should have the fast train or the new factory that manufacture clean energy product tomorrow will visit tampa florida where worker will soon break ground on a new high speed railroad fund by the|recovery|act there be project like that all across this country that will create job and help move nation 's good service and information should put more americans to work build clean energy facility and give rebate to americans who make home more energy efficient which support clean energy job and to encourage these and other business to stay within border be time to finally slash the tax break for company that ship job overseas and give those tax break to company that create job right here in now the house have pass a job bill that include some of these step as the first order of business this|year urge the senate to do the same and know will will people be out of work be hurt need help and want a job bill on desk without delay but the truth be these step will not make up for the job that have lose over the|last|2|years the only way to move to full employment be to lay a new foundation for long term economic growth and finally address the problem that america 's family have confront for year can not afford another so call economic expansion like the from the|last|decade what some call the lose decade where job grow more slowly than during any prior expansion where the income of the average american household decline while the cost of health care and tuition reach record high where prosperity be build on a housing bubble and financial speculation from the|day take office have be tell that address large challenge be too ambitious such an effort would be too contentious have be tell that political system be too gridlocke and that should just put thing on hold for a while for those who make these claim have simple question how long should wait how long should america put future on hold see washington have be tell to wait for decade even as the problem have grow bad meanwhile china 's not wait to revamp economy germany be not wait india be not wait these nation be they're not stand still these nation be not play for second place be put more emphasis on math and science be rebuild infrastructure be make serious investment in clean energy because want those job well do not accept second place for the|united|states|of|america as hard as may be as uncomfortable and contentious as the debate may become be time to get serious about fix the problem that be hamper growth now place to start be serious financial reform look be not interested in punish bank be interested in protect economy a strong healthy financial market make possible for business to access credit and create new job channel the saving of family into investment that raise income but that can only happen if guard against the same recklessness that nearly bring down entire economy need to make sure consumer and middle class family have the information need to make financial decision can not allow financial institution include those that take deposit to take risk that threaten the whole economy now the house have already pass financial reform with many of these change and the lobbyist be try to kill but can not let win this fight and if the bill that end up on desk do not meet the test of real reform will send back until get right have get to get right next need to encourage american innovation last|year make the large investment in basic research funding in history an investment that could lead to the world 's cheap solar cell or treatment that kill cancer cell but leave healthy one untouched and no area be more ripe for such innovation than energy can see the result of last|year 's investment in clean energy in the north|carolina company that will create job nationwide help to make advanced battery or in the california business that will put a|thousand people to work make solar panel but to create more of these clean energy job need more production more efficiency more incentive and that mean build a new generation of safe clean nuclear powerplant in this country mean make tough decision about open new offshore area for oil and gas development mean continue investment in advanced biofuel and clean coal technology and yes mean pass a comprehensive energy and climate bill with incentive that will finally make clean energy the profitable kind of energy in america now be grateful to the house for pass such a bill last|year and this|year be eager to help advance the bipartisan effort in the senate know there have be question about whether can afford such change in a tough economy know that there be those who disagree with the overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change but here be the thing even if doubt the evidence provide incentive for energy efficiency and clean energy be the right thing to do for future because the nation that lead the clean energy economy will be the nation that lead the global economy and america must be that nation third need to export more of good because the more product make and sell to other country the more job support right here in america so tonight set a new goal will double export over the|next|5|years an increase that will support job in america to help meet this goal be launch a national|export|initiative that will help farmer and small business increase export and reform export control consistent with national security have to seek new market aggressively just as competitor be if america sit on the sideline while other nation sign trade deal will lose the chance to create job on shore but realize those benefit also mean enforce those agreement so trading partner play by the rule and that be why will continue to shape a doha trade agreement that open global market and why will strengthen trade relation in asia and with key partner like south|korea and panama and colombia fourth need to invest in the skill and education of people now this|year have break through the stalemate between left and right by launch a national competition to improve school and the idea here be simple instead of rewarding failure only reward success instead of fund the status quo only invest in reform reform that raise student achievement inspire student to excel in math and science and turn around fail school that steal the future of too many young americans from rural community to the inner city in the|21st|century the good antipoverty program around be a world class education and in this country the success of child can not depend more on where live than on potential when renew the elementary and secondary education act will work with congress to expand these reform to all state still in this economy a high school diploma no longer guarantee a good job that be why urge the senate to follow the house and pass a bill that will revitalize community college which be a career pathway to the child of so many work family to make college more affordable this bill will finally end the unwarranted taxpayer subsidy that go to bank for student loan instead let take that money and give family a tax credit for of college and increase pell grant and let tell another|1|million student that when graduate will be require to pay of income on student loan and all of debt will be forgive after and forgive after if choose a career in public service because in the|united|states|of|america no one should go broke because choose to go to college and by the way be time for college and university to get serious about cut own cost because too have a responsibility to help solve this problem now the price of college tuition be just of the burden face the middle class that be why last|year ask vice president biden to chair a task force on middle class family that be why be nearly double the child care tax credit and make easy to save for retirement by give access to every worker a retirement account and expand the tax credit for those who start a nest egg that be why be work to lift the value of a family 's single large investment home the step take last|year to shore up the housing market have allow million of americans to take out new loan and save an average of on mortgage payment this|year will step up refinance so that homeowner can move into more affordable mortgage and be precisely to relieve the burden on middle class family that still need health insurance reform yes do now let clear a few thing up do not choose to tackle this issue to get some legislative victory under belt and by now should be fairly obvious that do not take on health care because be good politic take on health care because of the story have hear from americans with preexist condition whose life depend on get coverage patient who have be deny coverage family even those with insurance who be just illness away from financial ruin after nearly|a|century of try — democratic administration republican administration be close than ever to bring more security to the life of so many americans the approach have take would protect every american from the bad practice of the insurance industry would give small business and uninsured americans a chance to choose an affordable health care plan in a competitive market would require every insurance plan to cover preventive care and by the way want to acknowledge first lady michelle|obama who this|year be create a national movement to tackle the epidemic of childhood obesity and make kid healthier thank honey get embarrassed.&nbsp approach would preserve the right of americans who have insurance to keep doctor and plan would reduce cost and premium for million of family and business and accord to the|congressional|budget|office the independent organization that both party have cite as the official scorekeeper for congress approach would bring down the deficit by as|much|as|$1|trillion over the|next|two|decade still this be a complex issue and the longer be debate the more skeptical people become take share of the blame for not explain more clearly to the american people and know that with all the lobbying and horse trading the process leave most americans wonder what be in for but also know this problem be not go away by the time be finish speak tonight more americans will have lose health insurance million will lose this|year deficit will grow premium will go up patient will be deny the care need small business owner will continue to drop coverage altogether will not walk away from these americans and neither should the people in this chamber so as temperature cool want everyone to take another look at the plan have propose there be a reason why many doctor nurse and health care expert who know system best consider this approach a vast improvement over the status quo but if anyone from either party have a well approach that will bring down premium bring down the deficit cover the uninsured strengthen medicare for senior and stop insurance company abuse let know let know let know be eager to see here be what ask congress though do not walk away from reform not now not when be so close let find a way to come together and finish the job for the american people let get do let get do now even as health care reform would reduce deficit be not enough to dig out of a massive fiscal hole in which find be a challenge that make all other that much harder to solve and one that be be subject to a lot of political posturing so let start the discussion of government spending by set the record straight at the|beginning|of|the|last|decade the|year|2000 america have a budget surplus of over|$200|billion by the time take office have a deficit of over|$1|trillion and project deficit of over most of this be the result of not pay for war tax cut and an expensive prescription drug program on top of that the effect of the recession put a hole in budget all this be before walk in the door.&nbsp now — just state the fact now if have take office in ordinary time would have like nothing more than to start bring down the deficit but take office amid a crisis and effort to prevent a second depression have add another to national debt that too be a fact be absolutely convinced that be the right thing to do but family across the country be tighten belt and make tough decision the|federal|government should do the same so tonight be propose specific step to pay for the|trillion|dollar that take to rescue the economy last|year start in be prepared to freeze government spending for 3|year spend relate to national security medicare medicaid and social|security will not be affect but all other discretionary government program will like any cash strap family will work within a budget to invest in what need and sacrifice what do not and if have to enforce this discipline by veto will will continue to go through the budget line by line page by page to eliminate program that can not afford and do not work have already identify in saving for next|year to help work family will extend middle class tax cut but at a time of record deficit will not continue tax cut for oil company for investment fund manager and for those make over a year just can not afford now even after pay for what spend on watch will still face the massive deficit have when take office more importantly the cost of medicare medicaid and social|security will continue to skyrocket that be why have call for a bipartisan fiscal commission model on a proposal by republican judd|gregg and democrat kent|conrad this can not be of those washington gimmick that let pretend solve a problem the commission will have to provide a specific set of solution by a certain deadline now yesterday the senate block a bill that would have create this commission so will issue an executive order that will allow to go forward because refuse to pass this problem on to another generation of americans and when the vote come tomorrow the senate should restore the pay as go law that be a big reason for why have record surplus in the|1990s now know that some in own party will argue that can not address the deficit or freeze government spending when so many be still hurt and agree which be why this freeze will not take effect until next|year when the economy be strong that be how budgeting work but understand if do not take meaningful step to rein in debt could damage market increase the cost of borrowing and jeopardize recovery all of which would have an even bad effect on job growth and family income from some on the right expect will hear a different argument that if just make few investment in people extend tax cut include those for the wealthy americans eliminate more regulation maintain the status quo on health care deficit will go away the problem be that be what do for that be what help into this crisis be what help lead to these deficit can not do again rather than fight the same tired battle that have dominate washington for decade be time to try something new let invest in people without leave a mountain of debt let meet responsibility to the citizen who send here let try common sense a novel concept now to do that have to recognize that face more than a deficit of dollar right now face a deficit of trust deep and corrosive doubt about how washington work that have be grow for year to close that credibility gap have to take action on both end of pennsylvania|avenue to end the outsized influence of lobbyist to do work openly to give people the government deserve now that be what come to washington to do that be why for the first time in history administration post on white|house visitor online that be why have exclude lobbyist from policymake job or seat on federal board and commission but can not stop there be time to require lobbyist to disclose each contact make on behalf of a client with administration or with congress be time to put strict limit on the contribution that lobbyist give to candidate for federal office with all due deference to separation of power last|week the|supreme|court reverse a|century of law that believe will open the floodgate for special interest include foreign corporation to spend without limit in election do not think american election should be bankroll by america 's most powerful interest or bad by foreign entity should be decide by the american people and would urge democrats and republicans to pass a bill that help correct some of these problem be also call on congress to continue down the path of earmark reform democrats and republicans democrats and republicans look have trim some of this spending have embrace some meaningful change but restore the public trust demand more for example some member of congress post some earmark request online tonight be call on congress to publish all earmark request on a single web site before there be a vote so that the american people can see how money be be spent.&nbsp of course none of these reform will even happen if do not also reform how work with another now be not naive never think that the mere fact of election would usher in peace and harmony and — some postpartisan era know that both party have feed division that be deeply entrenched and on some issue there be simply philosophical difference that will always cause to part way these disagreement about the role of government in life about national priority and national security have be take place for over|200|year be the very essence of democracy but what frustrate the american people be a washington where every day be election|day can not wage a perpetual campaign where the only goal be to see who can get the most embarrassing headline about the other side a belief that if lose win neither party should delay or obstruct every single bill just because can the confirmation of — i'm speak to both party now the confirmation of well qualified public servant should not be hold hostage to the pet project or grudge of a few individual senator washington may think that say anything about the other side no matter how false no matter how malicious be just part of the game but be precisely such politic that have stop either party from help the american people worse yet be sow further division among citizen further distrust in government so no will not give up on try to change the tone of politic know be an|election|year and after last|week be clear that campaign fever have come even earlier than usual but still need to govern to democrats would remind that still have the large majority in decade and the people expect to solve problem not run for the hill and if the republican leadership be go to insist that vote in the senate be require to do any business at all in this town a supermajority then the responsibility to govern be now yours as well just say no to everything may be good short term politic but be not leadership be send here to serve citizen not ambition so let show the american people that can do together this|week will be address a meeting of the house republicans would like to begin monthly meeting with both democratic and republican leadership know can not wait.&nbsp now throughout history no issue have unite this country more than security sadly some of the unity feel after have dissipate and can argue all want about who be to blame for this but be not interested in relitigate the past know that all of love this country all of be commit to defense so let put aside the schoolyard taunt about who be tough let reject the false choice between protect people and uphold value let leave behind the fear and division and do what take to defend nation and forge a more hopeful future for america and for the world that be the work

help country prosper but each time a ceo reward for failure or a banker put the rest of at risk for own selfish gain people 's doubt grow each time lobbyist game the system or politician tear each other down instead of lift this country up lose faith the more that tv pundit reduce serious debate to silly argument big issue into sound bite citizen turn away no wonder there be so much cynicism out there no wonder there be so much disappointment campaign on the promise of change change can believe in the slogan go and right now know there be many americans who be not sure if still believe can change or that can deliver but remember this never suggest that change would be easy or that could do alone democracy in a nation of people can be noisy and messy and complicated and when try to do big thing and make big change stir passion and controversy that be just how be those of in public office can respond to this reality by play safe and avoid tell hard truth and point finger can do what be necessary to keep poll number high and get through the next election instead of do what be good for the next generation but also know this if people have make that decision or or would not be here tonight the only reason be here be because generation of americans be unafraid to do what be hard to do what be need even when success be uncertain to do what take to keep the dream of this nation alive for child and grandchild now administration have have some political setback this|year and some of be deserve but wake up every|day know that be nothing compare to the setback that family

stretch before do not quit do not quit let seize this moment to start anew to carry the dream forward and to strengthen union once more thank god bless and god bless the|united|states|of|america view transcript transcript majesties royal highnesses distinguished member of the|norwegian|nobel|committee citizen of america and citizen of the world & nbsp receive this honor with deep gratitude and great humility.&nbsp be an award that speak to high aspiration that for all the cruelty and hardship of world be not mere prisoner of fate.&nbsp action matter and can bend history in the direction of justice & nbsp and yet would be remiss if do not acknowledge the considerable controversy that generous decision have generated.&nbsp laughter.)&nbsp in part this be because be at the beginning and not the end of labor on the world stage.&nbsp compare to some of the giant of history who have receive this prize schweitzer and king marshall and mandela accomplishment be slight.&nbsp and then there be the man and woman around the world who have be jail and beat in the pursuit of justice those who toil in humanitarian organization to relieve suffering the unrecognized million whose quiet act of courage and compassion inspire even the most hardened cynics.&nbsp can not argue with those who find these man and woman some know some obscure to all but those help to be far more deserving of this honor than i. & nbsp but perhaps the most profound issue surround receipt of this prize be the fact that be the commander in chief of the military of a nation in the midst of wars.&nbsp of these war be wind down.&nbsp the other be a conflict that america do not seek in which be join by other country include norway in an effort to defend and all nation from further attack & nbsp still be at war and be responsible for the deployment of thousand of young americans to battle in a distant land.&nbsp some will kill and some will be killed.&nbsp and so come here with an acute sense of the cost of armed conflict fill with difficult question about the relationship between war and peace and effort to replace with the other & nbsp now these question be not new.&nbsp war in form or another appear with the first man.&nbsp at the dawn of history morality be not question be simply a fact like drought or disease the manner in which tribe and then civilization seek power and settle difference & nbsp and over time as code of law seek to control violence within group so do philosopher and cleric and statesman seek to regulate the destructive power of war.&nbsp the concept of a just war emerge suggest that war be justify only when certain condition be met:&nbsp if be wag as a last resort or in self defense if the force use be proportional and if whenever possible civilian be spare from violence & nbsp of course know that for most of history this concept of just war be rarely observed.&nbsp the capacity of human being to think up new way to kill another prove inexhaustible as do capacity to exempt from mercy those who look different or pray to a different god.&nbsp war between army give way to war between nation total war in which the distinction between combatant and civilian become blurred.&nbsp in the|span|of|30|year such carnage would twice engulf this continent.&nbsp and while be hard to conceive of a cause more just than the defeat of the|third|reich and the axis power world|war|ii be a conflict in which the total number of civilian who die exceed the number of soldier who perish & nbsp in the wake of such destruction and with the advent of the nuclear age become clear to victor and vanquish alike that the world need institution to prevent another world war.&nbsp and so after the united states senate reject an idea for which woodrow|wilson receive this prize america lead the world in construct an architecture to keep the peace:&nbsp a|marshall|plan and a|united|nation mechanism to govern the waging of war treaty to protect human right prevent genocide restrict the most dangerous weapon & nbsp in many way these effort succeeded.&nbsp yes terrible war have be fight and atrocity committed.&nbsp but there have be no third world war.&nbsp the|cold|war end with jubilant crowd dismantle a wall.&nbsp commerce have stitch much of the world together.&nbsp billion have be lift from poverty.&nbsp the ideal of liberty and self determination equality and the rule of law have haltingly advanced.&nbsp be the heir of the fortitude and foresight of generation past and be a legacy for which own country be rightfully proud & nbsp and yet a|decade into a|new|century this old architecture be buckle under the weight of new threats.&nbsp the world may no longer shudder at the prospect of war between nuclear superpower but proliferation may increase the risk of catastrophe.&nbsp terrorism have long be a tactic but modern technology allow a few small man with outsized rage to murder innocent on a horrific scale & nbsp moreover war between nation have increasingly give way to war within nations.&nbsp the resurgence of ethnic or sectarian conflict the growth of secessionist movement insurgency and fail state all these thing have increasingly trap civilian in unende chaos.&nbsp in today 's war many more civilian be kill than soldier the seed of future conflict be sow economy be wreck civil society tear asunder refugee amass child scar & nbsp do not bring with today a definitive solution to the problem of war.&nbsp what do know be that meet these challenge will require the same vision hard work and persistence of those man and woman who act so boldly decade ago.&nbsp and will require to think in new way about the notion of just war and the imperative of a just peace & nbsp must begin by acknowledge the hard truth:&nbsp will not eradicate violent conflict in lifetimes.&nbsp there will be time when nation act individually or in concert will find the use of force not only necessary but morally justified & nbsp make this statement mindful of what martin|luther|king|jr say in this same ceremony year ago:&nbsp violence never bring permanent peace.&nbsp solve no social problem:&nbsp merely create new and more complicated as someone who stand here as a direct consequence of dr. king 's life work be live testimony to the moral force of non - violence.&nbsp know there be nothing weak nothing passive nothing naïve in the creed and life of gandhi and king & nbsp but as a head of state swear to protect and defend nation can not be guide by example alone.&nbsp face the world as be and can not stand idle in the face of threat to the american people.&nbsp for make no mistake:&nbsp evil do exist in the world.&nbsp a non - violent movement could not have halt hitler 's armies.&nbsp negotiation can not convince al|qaeda 's leader to lay down arms.&nbsp to say that force may sometimes be necessary be not a call to cynicism be a recognition of history the imperfection of man and the limit of reason & nbsp raise this point begin with this point because in many country there be a deep ambivalence about military action today no matter what the cause.&nbsp and at time this be join by a reflexive suspicion of america the world 's sole military superpower & nbsp but the world must remember that be not simply international institution not just treaty and declaration that bring stability to a post - world|war|ii world.&nbsp whatever mistake have make the plain fact be this:&nbsp the|united|states|of|america have help underwrite global security for more|than|six|decade with the blood of citizen and the strength of arms.&nbsp the service and sacrifice of man and woman in uniform have promote peace and prosperity from germany to korea and enable democracy to take hold in place like the balkans.&nbsp have bear this burden not because seek to impose will.&nbsp have do so out of enlightened self interest because seek a well future for child and grandchild and believe that life will be well if other ' child and grandchild can live in freedom and prosperity & nbsp so yes the instrument of war do have a role to play in preserve the peace.&nbsp and yet this truth must coexist with another that no matter how justified war promise human tragedy.&nbsp the soldier 's courage and sacrifice be full of glory express devotion to country to cause to comrade in arms.&nbsp but war be never glorious and must never trumpet as such & nbsp so part of challenge be reconcile these seemingly inreconcilable truth that war be sometimes necessary and war at some level be an expression of human folly.&nbsp concretely must direct effort to the task that president kennedy call for long ago.&nbsp let focus say on a more practical more attainable peace base not on a sudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution in human a gradual evolution of human institution & nbsp what may this evolution look like?&nbsp what may these practical step be & nbsp to begin with believe that all nation strong and weak alike must adhere to standard that govern the use of force.&nbsp like any head of state reserve the right to act unilaterally if necessary to defend nation.&nbsp nevertheless be convinced that adhere to standard international standard strengthen those who do and isolate and weaken those who do not the world rally around america after the attack and continue to support effort in afghanistan because of the horror of those senseless attack and the recognize principle of self defense.&nbsp likewise the world recognize the need to confront when invade kuwait a consensus that send a clear message to all about the cost of aggression & nbsp furthermore america in fact no nation can insist that other follow the rule of the road if refuse to follow ourselves.&nbsp for when do not action appear arbitrary and undercut the legitimacy of future intervention no matter how justified & nbsp and this become particularly important when the purpose of military action extend beyond self defense or the defense of nation against an aggressor.&nbsp more and more all confront difficult question about how to prevent the slaughter of civilian by own government or to stop a civil war whose violence and suffering can engulf an entire region & nbsp believe that force can be justify on humanitarian ground as be in the balkans or in other place that have be scar by war.&nbsp inaction tear at conscience and can lead to more costly intervention later.&nbsp that be why all responsible nation must embrace the role that militarie with a clear mandate can play to keep the peace & nbsp america 's commitment to global security will never waver.&nbsp but in a world in which threat be more diffuse and mission more complex america can not act alone.&nbsp america alone can not secure the peace.&nbsp this be true in afghanistan.&nbsp this be true in fail state like somalia where terrorism and piracy be join by famine and human suffering.&nbsp and sadly will continue to be true in unstable region for year to come & nbsp the leader and soldier of nato country and other friend and ally demonstrate this truth through the capacity and courage have show in afghanistan.&nbsp but in many country there be a disconnect between the effort of those who serve and the ambivalence of the broad public.&nbsp understand why war be not popular but also know this:&nbsp the belief that peace be desirable be rarely enough to achieve peace require responsibility.&nbsp peace entail sacrifice.&nbsp that be why nato continue to be indispensable.&nbsp that be why must strengthen u.n. and regional peacekeeping and not leave the task to a few countries.&nbsp that be why honor those who return home from peacekeeping and training abroad to oslo and rome to ottawa and sydney to dhaka and kigali honor not as maker of war but of wager but as wager of peace & nbsp let make final point about the use of force.&nbsp even as make difficult decision about go to war must also think clearly about how fight it.&nbsp the|nobel|committee recognize this truth in award first prize for peace to henry|dunant the founder of the|red|cross and a drive force behind the|geneva|convention & nbsp where force be necessary have a moral and strategic interest in bind to certain rule of conduct.&nbsp and even as confront a vicious adversary that abide by no rule believe must remain a standard bearer in the conduct of war.&nbsp that be what make different from those whom fight.&nbsp that be a source of strength.&nbsp that be why prohibit torture.&nbsp that be why order the prison at guantanamo|bay closed.&nbsp and that be why have reaffirm america 's commitment to abide by the|geneva|conventions.&nbsp lose when compromise the very ideal that fight to defend.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp and honor honor those ideal by uphold not when be easy but when be hard & nbsp have speak at some length to the question that must weigh on mind and heart as choose to wage war.&nbsp but let now turn to effort to avoid such tragic choice and speak of way that can build a just and last peace & nbsp first in deal with those nation that break rule and law believe that must develop alternative to violence that be tough enough to actually change behavior for if want a lasting peace then the word of the international community must mean something.&nbsp those regime that break the rule must be hold accountable.&nbsp sanction must exact a real price.&nbsp intransigence must be meet with increase pressure and such pressure exist only when the world stand together as & nbsp urgent example be the effort to prevent the spread of nuclear weapon and to seek a world without them.&nbsp in the|middle|of|the|last|century nation agree to be bind by a treaty whose bargain be clear:&nbsp all will have access to peaceful nuclear power those without nuclear weapon will forsake and those with nuclear weapon will work towards disarmament.&nbsp be commit to uphold this treaty.&nbsp be a centerpiece of foreign policy.&nbsp and be work with president medvedev to reduce america and russia 's nuclear stockpile & nbsp but be also incumbent upon all of to insist that nation like iran and north|korea do not game the system.&nbsp those who claim to respect international law can not avert eye when those law be those who care for own security can not ignore the danger of an arm race in the|middle|east or east|asia.&nbsp those who seek peace can not stand idly by as nation arm for nuclear war the same principle apply to those who violate international law by brutalize own people.&nbsp when there be genocide in darfur systematic rape in congo repression in burma there must be consequences.&nbsp yes there will be engagement yes there will be diplomacy but there must be consequence when those thing fail.&nbsp and the closer stand together the less likely will be face with the choice between armed intervention and complicity in oppression & nbsp this bring to a second point the nature of the peace that seek.&nbsp for peace be not merely the absence of visible conflict.&nbsp only a just peace base on the inherent right and dignity of every individual can truly be last & nbsp be this insight that drive drafter of the|universal|declaration|of|human|right after the second world war.&nbsp in the wake of devastation recognize that if human right be not protect peace be a hollow promise & nbsp and yet too often these word be ignored.&nbsp for some country the failure to uphold human right be excuse by the false suggestion that these be somehow western principle foreign to local culture or stage of a nation 's development.&nbsp and within america there have long be a tension between those who describe as realist or idealist a tension that suggest a stark choice between the narrow pursuit of interest or an endless campaign to impose value around the world & nbsp reject these choices.&nbsp believe that peace be unstable where citizen be deny the right to speak freely or worship as please choose own leader or assemble without pent up grievance fester and the suppression of tribal and religious identity can lead to violence.&nbsp also know that the opposite be true.&nbsp only when europe become free do finally find peace.&nbsp america have never fight a war against a democracy and close friend be government that protect the right of citizens.&nbsp no matter how callously define neither america 's interest nor the world 's be serve by the denial of human aspiration & nbsp so even as respect the unique culture and tradition of different country america will always be a voice for those aspiration that be universal.&nbsp will bear witness to the quiet dignity of reformer like aung|sang|suu|kyi to the bravery of zimbabweans who cast ballot in the face of beating to the|hundreds|of|thousand who have march silently through the street of iran.&nbsp be tell that the leader of these government fear the aspiration of own people more than the power of any other nation.&nbsp and be the responsibility of all free people and free nation to make clear that these movement these movement of hope and history have on side & nbsp let also say this:&nbsp the promotion of human right can not be about exhortation alone.&nbsp at time must be couple with painstake diplomacy.&nbsp know that engagement with repressive regime lack the satisfying purity of indignation.&nbsp but also know that sanction without outreach condemnation without discussion can carry forward only a crippling status quo.&nbsp no repressive regime can move down a new path unless have the choice of an open door & nbsp in light of the|cultural|revolution 's horror nixon 's meeting with mao appear inexcusable and yet surely help set china on a path where million of citizen have be lift from poverty and connect to open societies.&nbsp pope john|paul 's engagement with poland create space not just for the|catholic|church but for labor leader like lech walesa.&nbsp ronald|reagan 's effort on arm control and embrace of not only improve relation with the|soviet|union but empower dissident throughout eastern europe.&nbsp there be no simple formula here.&nbsp but must try as best can to balance isolation and engagement pressure and incentive so that human right and dignity be advance over time & nbsp third a just peace include not only civil and political right must encompass economic security and opportunity.&nbsp for true peace be not just freedom from fear but freedom from want & nbsp be undoubtedly true that development rarely take root without security be also true that security do not exist where human being do not have access to enough food or clean water or the medicine and shelter need to survive.&nbsp do not exist where child can not aspire to a decent education or a job that support a family.&nbsp the absence of hope can rot a society from within & nbsp and that be why help farmer feed own people or nation educate child and care for the sick be not mere charity.&nbsp be also why the world must come together to confront climate change.&nbsp there be little scientific dispute that if do nothing will face more drought more famine more mass displacement all of which will fuel more conflict for decades.&nbsp for this reason be not merely scientist and environmental activist who call for swift and forceful action be military leader in own country and other who understand common security hang in the balance & nbsp agreement among nations.&nbsp strong institutions.&nbsp support for human rights.&nbsp investment in development.&nbsp all these be vital ingredient in bring about the evolution that president kennedy speak about.&nbsp and yet do not believe that will have the will the determination the stay power to complete this work without something more and that be the continued expansion of moral imagination an insistence that there be something irreducible that all share & nbsp as the world grow small may think would be easy for human being to recognize how similar be to understand that be all basically seek the same thing that all hope for the chance to live out life with some measure of happiness and fulfillment for and family & nbsp and yet somehow give the dizzying pace of globalization the cultural leveling of modernity perhaps come as no surprise that people fear the loss of what cherish in particular identity race tribe and perhaps most powerfully religion.&nbsp in some place this fear have lead to conflict.&nbsp at time even feel like be move backwards.&nbsp see in the|middle|east as the conflict between arabs and jews seem to harden.&nbsp see in nation that be tear asunder by tribal line & nbsp and most dangerously see in the way that religion be use to justify the murder of innocent by those who have distort and defile the great religion of islam and who attack country from afghanistan.&nbsp these extremist be not the first to kill in the name of god the cruelty of the crusades be amply recorded.&nbsp but remind that no|holy|war can ever be a just war.&nbsp for if truly believe that be carry out divine will then there be no need for restraint no need to spare the pregnant mother or the medic or the|red|cross worker or even a person of one 's own faith.&nbsp such a warped view of religion be not just incompatible with the concept of peace but believe be incompatible with the very purpose of faith for the rule that lie at the heart of every major religion be that do unto other as would have do unto adhere to this law of love have always be the core struggle of human nature.&nbsp for be fallible.&nbsp make mistake and fall victim to the temptation of pride and power and sometimes evil.&nbsp even those of with the good of intention will at time fail to right the wrong before but do not have to think that human nature be perfect for to still believe that the human condition can be perfected.&nbsp do not have to live in an idealize world to still reach for those ideal that will make a well place.&nbsp the non - violence practice by man like gandhi and king may not have be practical or possible in every circumstance but the love that preach fundamental faith in human progress that must always be the|north|star that guide on journey & nbsp for if lose that faith if dismiss as silly or naïve if divorce from the decision that make on issue of war and peace then lose what be good about humanity.&nbsp lose sense of possibility.&nbsp lose moral compass & nbsp like generation have before must reject that future.&nbsp as dr. king say at this occasion so refuse to accept despair as the final response to the ambiguity of history.&nbsp refuse to accept the idea that the isness of man 's present condition make morally incapable of reach up for the eternal oughtness that forever confront & nbsp let reach for the world that ought to be that spark of the divine that still stir within each of souls.&nbsp applause somewhere today in the here and now in the world as be a soldier see be outgunne but stand firm to keep the peace.&nbsp somewhere today in this world a young protestor await the brutality of government but have the courage to march on.&nbsp somewhere today a mother face punish poverty still take the time to teach child scrape together what few coin

strive for justice.&nbsp can admit the intractability of depravation and still strive for dignity.&nbsp clear eyed can understand that there will be war and still strive for peace.&nbsp can do that for that be the story of human progress that be the hope of all the world and at this moment of challenge that must be work here on earth thank very much.&nbsp view transcript transcript good evening.&nbsp to the|united|states|corps|of|cadet to the man and woman of armed|service and to fellow americans:&nbsp want to speak to tonight about effort in afghanistan the nature of commitment there the scope of interest and the strategy that administration will pursue to bring this war to a successful conclusion.&nbsp be an extraordinary honor for to do so here at west|point where so many man and woman have prepare to stand up for security and to represent what be fine about country to address these important issue be important to recall why america and ally be compel to fight a war in afghanistan in the first place.&nbsp do not ask for this fight on september|11,|2001 man hijack airplane and use to murder nearly|3,000 people.&nbsp strike at military and economic nerve centers.&nbsp take the life of innocent man woman and child without regard to faith or race or station.&nbsp be not for the heroic action of passenger onboard of those flight could have also strike at of the great symbol of democracy in washington and kill many more as know these man belong to al|qaeda a group of extremist who have distort and defile islam of the world ’s great religion to justify the slaughter of innocent ’s base of operation be in afghanistan where be harbor by the taliban a ruthless repressive and radical movement that seize control of that country after be ravage by year of soviet occupation and civil war and after the attention of america and friend have turn elsewhere just|day after congress authorize the use of force against al|qaeda and those who harbor an authorization that continue to this day.&nbsp the vote in the senate be to the vote in the house be to for the first time in history the|north|atlantic|treaty|organization invoke article|5 the commitment that say an attack on member nation be an attack on all.&nbsp and the|united|nations|security|council endorse the use of all necessary step to respond to the attacks.&nbsp america ally and the world be act as to destroy al|qaeda ’s terrorist network and to protect common security under the banner of this domestic unity and international legitimacy and only after the taliban refuse to turn over osama|bin|laden send troop into afghanistan.&nbsp within a|matter|of|month al|qaeda be scatter and many of operative be killed.&nbsp the taliban be drive from power and push back on heels.&nbsp a place that have know decade of fear now have reason to hope.&nbsp at a conference convene by the u.n. a provisional government be establish under president hamid|karzai.&nbsp and an international|security|assistance|force be establish to help bring a lasting peace to a war tear country then in early|2003 the decision be make to wage a second war in iraq.&nbsp the wrench debate over the|iraq|war be well know and nee not be repeat here.&nbsp be enough to say that for the|next|six|year the iraq war draw the dominant share of troop resource diplomacy and national attention and that the decision to go into iraq cause substantial rift between america and much of the world today after extraordinary cost be bring the|iraq|war to a responsible end.&nbsp will remove combat brigade from iraq by and all of troop by the end of that be do so be a testament to the character of the man and woman in uniform.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp thank to courage grit and perseverance have give iraqis a chance to shape future and be successfully leave iraq to people.&nbsp but while have achieve hard earn milestone in iraq the situation in afghanistan have deteriorated.&nbsp after escape across the border into pakistan in and al|qaeda ’s leadership establish a safe haven there.&nbsp although a legitimate government be elect by the afghan people be be hamper by corruption the drug trade an under develop economy and insufficient security forces.&nbsp over the taliban have maintain common cause with al|qaeda as both seek an overthrow of the afghan government.&nbsp gradually the taliban have begin to control additional swath of territory in afghanistan while engage in increasingly brazen and devastating attack of terrorism against the pakistani people now throughout this period troop level in afghanistan remain a fraction of what be in iraq.&nbsp when take office have just|over|32,000 americans serve in afghanistan compare to in iraq at the peak of the war.&nbsp commander in afghanistan repeatedly ask for support to deal with the reemergence of the taliban but these reinforcement do not arrive.&nbsp and that be why shortly after take office approve a longstanding request for more troops.&nbsp after consultation with ally then announce a strategy recognize the fundamental connection between war effort in afghanistan and the extremist safe haven in pakistan.&nbsp set a goal that be narrowly define as disrupt dismantle and defeat al|qaeda and extremist ally and pledge to better coordinate military and civilian efforts.&nbsp since then have make progress on some important objectives.&nbsp high rank al|qaeda and taliban leader have be kill and have step up the pressure on al|qaeda worldwide in pakistan that nation 's army have go on large offensive in years.&nbsp in afghanistan and ally prevent the taliban from stop a presidential election and although be mar by fraud that election produce a government that be consistent with afghanistan 's law and constitution yet huge challenge remain.&nbsp afghanistan be not lose but for several|year have move backwards.&nbsp there be no imminent threat of the government be overthrow but the taliban have gain al|qaeda have not reemerge in afghanistan in the same number as before but retain safe haven along the border.&nbsp and force lack the full support need to effectively train and partner with afghan security force and better secure the population.&nbsp new commander in afghanistan general|mcchrystal have report that the security situation be more serious than anticipated.&nbsp in short:&nbsp the status quo be not sustainable & nbsp as cadet volunteer for service during this time of danger.&nbsp some of fight in afghanistan.&nbsp some of will deploy there.&nbsp as commander in chief owe a mission that be clearly define and worthy of service.&nbsp and that be why after the afghan voting be complete insist on a thorough review of strategy.&nbsp now let be clear:&nbsp there have never be an option before that call for troop deployment before so there have be no delay or denial of resource necessary for the conduct of the war during this review period.&nbsp instead the review have allow to ask the hard question and to explore all the different option along with national security team military and civilian leadership in afghanistan and key partners.&nbsp and give the stake involve owe the american people and troop no less & nbsp this review be now and as commander in chief have determine that be in vital national interest to send an|additional|30,000 u.s. troop to afghanistan.&nbsp after troop will begin to come home.&nbsp these be the resource that need to seize the initiative while build the afghan capacity that can allow for a responsible transition of force out of afghanistan.&nbsp & nbsp do not make this decision lightly.&nbsp oppose the war in iraq precisely because believe that must exercise restraint in the use of military force and always consider the long term consequence of actions.&nbsp have be at war now for eight|year at enormous cost in life and resources.&nbsp year of debate over iraq and terrorism have leave unity on national security issue in tatter and create a highly polarize and partisan backdrop for this effort.&nbsp and have just experience the bad economic crisis since the|great|depression the american people be understandably focused on rebuild economy and put people to work here at home & nbsp most of all know that this decision ask even more of a military that along with family have already bear the heavy of all burdens.&nbsp as president have sign a letter of condolence to the family of each american who give life in these wars.&nbsp have read the letter from the parent and spouse of those who deployed.&nbsp visit courageous wound warrior at have travel to dover to meet the flag drape casket of americans return home to final resting place.&nbsp see firsthand the terrible wage of war.&nbsp if do not think that the security of the|united|state and the safety of the american people be at stake in afghanistan would gladly order every single of troop home tomorrow & nbsp so no do not make this decision lightly.&nbsp make this decision because be convinced that security be at stake in afghanistan and pakistan.&nbsp this be the epicenter of violent extremism practice by al|qaeda.&nbsp be from here that be attack on and be from here that new attack be be plot as speak.&nbsp this be no idle danger no hypothetical threat.&nbsp in the|last|few|month alone have apprehend extremist within border who be send here from the border region of afghanistan and pakistan to commit new act of terror and this danger will only grow if the region slide backwards and al|qaeda can operate with impunity.&nbsp must keep the pressure on al|qaeda and to do that must increase the stability and capacity of partner in the region & nbsp of course this burden be not alone to bear.&nbsp this be not just america 's war.&nbsp since al|qaeda ’s safe haven have be the source of attack against london and amman and bali.&nbsp the people and government of both afghanistan and pakistan be endangered.&nbsp and the stake be even high within a nuclear armed pakistan because know that al|qaeda and other extremist seek nuclear weapon and have every reason to believe that would use these fact compel to act along with friend and allies.&nbsp overarching goal remain the same:&nbsp to disrupt dismantle and defeat al|qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan and to prevent capacity to threaten america and ally in the future to meet that goal will pursue the follow objective within afghanistan.&nbsp must deny al|qaeda a safe haven.&nbsp must reverse the taliban 's momentum and deny the ability to overthrow the government.&nbsp and must strengthen the capacity of afghanistan 's security force and government so that can take lead responsibility for afghanistan 's future.&nbsp will meet these objective in ways.&nbsp first will pursue a military strategy that will break the taliban 's momentum and increase afghanistan 's capacity over the|next|18|month the additional troop that be announce tonight will deploy in the first part of the fast possible pace so that can target the insurgency and secure key population centers.&nbsp will increase ability to train competent afghan security force and to partner with so that more afghans can get into the fight.&nbsp and will help create the condition for the|united|state to transfer responsibility to the afghans.&nbsp because this be an international effort have ask that commitment be join by contribution from allies.&nbsp some have already provide additional troop and be confident that there will be further contribution in the|day and week ahead friend have fight and bleed and die alongside in afghanistan.&nbsp and now must come together to end this war successfully.&nbsp for what be at stake be not simply a test of nato 's credibility what be at stake be the security of ally and the common security of the world but take together these additional american and international troop will allow to accelerate handing over responsibility to afghan force and allow to begin the transfer of force out of afghanistan in july of just as have do in iraq will execute this transition responsibly take into account condition on the ground.&nbsp will continue to advise and assist afghanistan 's security force to ensure that can succeed over the long haul.&nbsp but will be clear to the afghan government and more importantly to the afghan people that will ultimately be responsible for own country.&nbsp will work with partner the|united|nation and the afghan people to pursue a more effective civilian strategy so that the government can take advantage of improved security this effort must be base on performance.&nbsp the|day of provide a blank check be president karzai 's inauguration speech send the right message about move in a new direction.&nbsp and go forward will be clear about what expect from those who receive assistance.&nbsp will support afghan ministry governor and local leader that combat corruption and deliver for the people.&nbsp expect those who be ineffective or corrupt to be hold accountable.&nbsp and will also focus assistance in area such as agriculture that can make an immediate impact in the life of the afghan people the people of afghanistan have endure violence for decade have be confront with occupation by the|soviet|union and then by foreign al|qaeda fighter who use afghan land for own purposes.&nbsp so tonight want the afghan people to understand america seek an end to this era of war and suffering.&nbsp have no interest in occupy country.&nbsp will support effort by the afghan government to open the door to those taliban who abandon violence and respect the human right of fellow citizens.&nbsp and will seek a partnership with afghanistan ground in mutual respect to isolate those who destroy to strengthen those who build to hasten the|day when troop will leave and to forge a lasting friendship in which america be partner and never patron third will act with the full recognition that success in afghanistan be inextricably link to partnership with pakistan be in afghanistan to prevent a cancer from once again spread through that country.&nbsp but this same cancer have also take root in the border region of pakistan.&nbsp that be why need a strategy that work on both side of the border in the past there have be those in pakistan who have argue that the struggle against extremism be not fight and that pakistan be well off do little or seek accommodation with those who use violence.&nbsp but in recent|years as innocent have be kill from karachi to islamabad have become clear that be the pakistani people who be the most endanger by extremism.&nbsp public opinion have turned.&nbsp the pakistani army have wag an offensive in swat and south waziristan.&nbsp and there be no doubt that the|united|states and pakistan share a common enemy in the past too often define relationship with pakistan narrowly.&nbsp those|day be move forward be commit to a partnership with pakistan that be build on a foundation of mutual interest mutual respect and mutual trust will strengthen pakistan ’s capacity to target those group that threaten country and have make clear that can not tolerate a safe haven for terrorist whose location be know and whose intention be clear.&nbsp america be also provide substantial resource to support pakistan ’s democracy and development.&nbsp be the large international supporter for those pakistanis displace by the fighting.&nbsp and go forward the pakistan people must know america will remain a strong supporter of pakistan ’s security and prosperity long after the gun have fall silent so that the great potential of people can be unleashed these be the core element of strategy:&nbsp a military effort to create the condition for a transition a civilian surge that reinforce positive action and an effective partnership with pakistan recognize there be a range of concern about approach.&nbsp so let briefly address a few of the more prominent argument that have hear and which take very seriously & nbsp first there be those who suggest that afghanistan be another vietnam.&nbsp argue that can not be stabilize and be well off cut loss and rapidly withdrawing.&nbsp believe this argument depend on a false reading of history.&nbsp unlike vietnam be join by a broad coalition of nation that recognize the legitimacy of action.&nbsp unlike vietnam be not face a broad base popular insurgency.&nbsp and most importantly unlike vietnam the american people be viciously attack from afghanistan and remain a target for those same extremist who be plot along border.&nbsp to abandon this area now and to rely only on effort against al|qaeda from a distance would significantly hamper ability to keep the pressure on al|qaeda and create an unacceptable risk of additional attack on homeland and allies.&nbsp & nbsp second there be those who acknowledge that can not leave afghanistan in current state but suggest that go forward with the troop that already have.&nbsp but this would simply maintain a status quo in which muddle through and permit a slow deterioration of condition there.&nbsp would ultimately prove more costly and prolong stay in afghanistan because would never be able to generate the condition need to train afghan security force and give the space to take over & nbsp finally there be those who oppose identify a time frame for transition to afghan responsibility.&nbsp indeed some call for a more dramatic and open ended escalation of war one that would commit to a nation building project of up to a decade.&nbsp reject this course because set goal that be beyond what can be achieve at a reasonable cost and what need to achieve to secure interests.&nbsp furthermore the absence of a time frame for transition would deny any sense of urgency in work with the afghan government.&nbsp must be clear that afghans will have to take responsibility for security and that america have no interest in fight an endless war in afghanistan as president refuse to set goal that go beyond responsibility mean or interests.&nbsp and must weigh all of the challenge that nation faces.&nbsp do not have the luxury of commit to just one.&nbsp indeed be mindful of the word of president eisenhower who in discuss national security say each proposal must be weigh in the light of a broad consideration:&nbsp the need to maintain balance in and among national program over the|past|several|years have lose that balance.&nbsp have fail to appreciate the connection between national security and in the wake of an economic crisis too many of neighbor and friend be out of work and struggle to pay the bills.&nbsp too many americans be worried about the future face children.&nbsp meanwhile competition within the global economy have grow more fierce.&nbsp so can not simply afford to ignore the price of these war all tell by the time take office the cost of the war in iraq and afghanistan approach a dollars.&nbsp go forward be commit to address these cost openly and new approach in afghanistan be likely to cost roughly|$30|billion for the military this|year and will work closely with congress to address these cost as work to bring down deficit but as end the war in iraq and transition to afghan responsibility must rebuild strength here at home.&nbsp prosperity provide a foundation for power.&nbsp pay for military.&nbsp underwrite diplomacy.&nbsp tap the potential of people and allow investment in new industry.&nbsp and will allow to compete in this|century as successfully as do in the last.&nbsp that be why troop commitment in afghanistan can not be open ended because the nation that be most interested in building be own now let be clear:&nbsp none of this will be easy.&nbsp the struggle against violent extremism will not be finish quickly and extend well beyond afghanistan and pakistan.&nbsp will be an endure test of free society and leadership in the world.&nbsp and unlike the great power conflict and clear line of division that define the|20th|century effort will involve disorderly region failed state diffuse enemy so as a result america will have to show strength in the way that end war and prevent conflict not just how wage wars.&nbsp will have to be nimble and precise in use of military power.&nbsp where al|qaeda and ally attempt to establish a foothold whether in somalia or yemen or elsewhere must be confront by grow pressure and strong partnership and can not count on military may alone.&nbsp have to invest in homeland security because can not capture or kill every violent extremist abroad.&nbsp have to improve and better coordinate intelligence so that stay step ahead of shadowy network & nbsp will have to take away the tool of mass destruction.&nbsp and that be why have make a central pillar of foreign policy to secure loose nuclear material from terrorist to stop the spread of nuclear weapon and to pursue the goal of a world without because every nation must understand that true security will never come from an endless race for ever more destructive weapon true security will come for those who reject & nbsp will have to use diplomacy because no nation can meet the challenge of an interconnect world act alone.&nbsp have spend this|year renew alliance and forge new partnerships.&nbsp and have forge a new beginning between america and the muslim world one that recognize mutual interest in break a cycle of conflict and that promise a future in which those who kill innocent be isolate by those who stand up for peace and prosperity and human dignity & nbsp and finally must draw on the strength of value for the challenge that face may have change but the thing that believe in must not.&nbsp that be why must promote value by live at home which be why have prohibit torture and will close the prison at guantanamo|bay.&nbsp and must make clear to every man woman and child around the world who live under the dark cloud of tyranny that america will speak out on behalf of human right and tend to the light of freedom and justice and opportunity and respect for the dignity of all peoples.&nbsp that be who are.&nbsp that be the source the moral source of america ’s authority since the|days of franklin|roosevelt and the service and sacrifice of grandparent and great grandparent country have bear a special burden in global affairs.&nbsp have spill american blood in many country on multiple continents.&nbsp have spend revenue to help other rebuild from rubble and develop own economies.&nbsp have join with other to develop an architecture of institution from the|united|nation to nato to the|world|bank that provide for the common security and prosperity of human being have not always be thank for these effort and have at time make mistakes.&nbsp but more than any other nation the|united|states|of|america have underwrite global security for a time that for all problem have see wall come down and market open and billion lift from poverty unparalleled scientific progress and advance frontier of human liberty.&nbsp for unlike the great power of old have not seek world domination.&nbsp union be found in resistance to oppression do not seek to occupy other nations.&nbsp will not claim another nation ’s resource or target other people because faith or ethnicity be different from ours.&nbsp what have fight for what continue to fight for be a well future for child and grandchildren.&nbsp and believe that life will be well if other people child and grandchild can live in freedom and access opportunity.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp as a country be not as young and perhaps not as innocent as be when roosevelt be president.&nbsp yet be still heir to a noble struggle for freedom.&nbsp and now must summon all of might and moral suasion to meet the challenge of a new age.&nbsp in the end security and leadership do not come solely from the strength of arms.&nbsp derive from people from the worker and business who will rebuild economy from the entrepreneur and researcher who will pioneer new industry from the teacher that will educate child and the service of those who work in community at home from the diplomat and peace|corps volunteer who spread hope abroad and from the man and woman in uniform who be part of an unbroken line of sacrifice that have make government of the people by the people and for the people a reality on applause.)&nbsp this vast and diverse citizenry will not always agree on every issue nor should we.&nbsp but also know that as a country can not sustain leadership nor navigate the momentous challenge of time if allow to be split asunder by the same rancor and cynicism and partisanship that have in recent time poison national discourse be easy to forget that when this war begin be unite bind together by the fresh memory of a horrific attack and by the determination to defend homeland and the value hold dear.&nbsp refuse to accept the notion that can not summon that unity again.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp believe with every fiber of being that as americans can still come together behind a common purpose.&nbsp for value be not simply word write into parchment be a creed that call together and that have carry through the dark of storm as nation as people america be pass through a time of great trial.&nbsp and the message that send in the midst of these storm must be clear:&nbsp that cause be just resolve unwavering.&nbsp will go forward with the confidence that right make may and with the commitment to forge an america that be safe a world that be more secure and a future that represent not the deep of fear but the high of hopes.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp thank you.&nbsp god bless you.&nbsp may god bless the|united|state of america.&nbsp applause.)&nbsp thank very much.&nbsp thank you.&nbsp applause view transcript transcript madam speaker vice president biden members of congress and the american people when speak here last|winter this nation be face the bad economic crisis since the|great|depression be lose an average of job per month credit be freeze and financial system be on the verge of collapse now as any american who be still look for work or a way to pay bill will tell be by no means out of the wood a full and vibrant recovery be still many|months away and will not let up until those americans who seek job can find until those business that seek capital and credit can thrive until all responsible homeowner can stay in home that be ultimate goal but thank to the bold and decisive action have take since january can stand here with confidence and say that have pull this economy back from the brink want to thank the member of this body for effort and support in these|last|several|month and especially those who have take the difficult vote that have put on a path to recovery also want to thank the american people for patience and resolve during this try time for nation but do not come here just to clean up crisis come here to build a future so tonight return to speak to all of about an issue that be central to that future and that be the issue of health care be not the first president to take up this cause but be determined to be the last have now be nearly|a|century since theodore|roosevelt first call for health care reform and ever since nearly every president and congress whether democrat or republican have attempt to meet this challenge in some way a bill for comprehensive health reform be first introduce by john|dingell sr . in five|years|later son continue to introduce that same bill at the beginning of each session collective failure to meet this challenge year after year decade after decade have lead to the breaking point everyone understand the extraordinary hardship that be place on the uninsured who live every day just accident or illness away from bankruptcy these be not primarily people on welfare these be middle class americans some can not get insurance on the job other be self employ and can not afford since buy insurance on own cost time as much as the coverage get from employer many other americans who be willing and able to pay be still deny insurance due to previous illness or condition that insurance company decide be too risky or too expensive to cover be the only democracy the only advanced democracy on earth the only wealthy nation that allow such hardship for million of people there be now more|than|30|million american citizen who can not get coverage in just a period in every americans go without health care coverage at some point and every|day americans lose coverage in other word can happen to anyone but the problem that plague the health care system be not just a problem for the uninsured those who do have insurance have never have less security and stability than do today more and more americans worry that if move lose job or change job will lose health insurance too more and more americans pay premium only to discover that insurance company have drop coverage when get sick or will not pay the full cost of care happen every|day man from illinois lose coverage in the middle of chemotherapy because insurer find that have not report gallstone that do not even know about delay treatment and die because of another woman from texas be about to get a double mastectomy when insurance company cancel policy because forget to declare a case of acne by the time have insurance reinstate breast cancer have more than double in size that be heart break be wrong and no one should be treat that way in then there be the problem of rise cost spend one|and|a|half time more per person on health care than any other country but be not any healthier for this be of the reason that insurance premium have go up time faster than wage be why so many employer especially small business be force employer employee to pay more for insurance or be drop coverage entirely be why so many aspiring entrepreneur can not afford to open a business in the first place and why american business that compete internationally like automaker be at a huge disadvantage and be why those of with health insurance be also pay a hidden and grow tax for those without per year that pay for somebody else 's emergency room and charitable care finally health care system be place an unsustainable burden on taxpayer when health care cost grow at the rate have put great pressure on program like medicare and medicaid if do nothing to slow these skyrocketing cost will eventually be spend more on medicare and medicaid than every other government program combine put simply health care problem be deficit problem nothing else even come close nothing else now these be the fact nobody dispute know must reform this system the question be how now there be those on the left who believe that the only way to fix the system be through a single payer system like canada 's where would severely restrict the private insurance market and have the government provide coverage for everybody on the right there be those who argue that should end employer base system and leave individual to buy health insurance on own have say — have to say that there be argument to be make for both these approach but either one would represent a radical shift that would disrupt the health care most people currently have since health care represent sixth of economy believe make more sense to build on what work and fix what do not rather than try to build an entirely new system from scratch and that be precisely what those of in congress have try to do over the several past several month during that time have see washington at good and at bad have see many in this chamber work tirelessly for the well part of this|year to offer thoughtful idea about how to achieve reform of the committee ask to develop bill have complete work and the|senate|finance|committee announce today that will move forward next|week that have never happen before overall effort have be support by an unprecedented coalition of doctor and nurse hospital senior ' group and even drug company many of whom oppose reform in the past and there be agreement in this chamber on about|80|percent of what need to be do put closer to the goal of reform than have ever be but what have also see in these|last|months be the same partisan spectacle that only harden the disdain many americans have towards own government instead of honest debate have see scare tactic some have dig into unyielde ideological camp that offer no hope of compromise too many have use this as an opportunity to score short term political point even if rob the country of opportunity to solve a long term challenge and out of this blizzard of charge and countercharge confusion have reign well the time for bickering be over the time for game have pass now be the season for action now be when must bring the good idea of both party together and show the american people that can still do what be send here to do now be the time to deliver on health care now be the time to deliver on health care the plan be announce tonight would meet basic goal will provide more security and stability to those who have health insurance will provide insurance for those who do not and will slow the growth of health care cost for family business and government be a plan that ask everyone to take responsibility for meet this challenge not just government not just insurance company but everybody include employer and individual and be a plan that incorporate idea from senator and congressmen from democrats and republicans and yes from some of opponent in both the primary and general election here be the detail that every american need to know about this plan first if be among the hundreds|of|millions of americans who already have health insurance through job or medicare or medicaid or the va nothing in this plan will require or employer to change the coverage or the doctor have let repeat this nothing in plan require to change what have what this plan will do be make the insurance have work better for under this plan will be against the law for insurance company to deny coverage because of a preexist condition as soon as sign this bill will be against the law for insurance company to drop coverage when get sick or water down when need the most will no longer be able to place some arbitrary cap on the amount of coverage can receive in a|given|year or in a lifetime will place a limit on how much can be charge for out of pocket expense because in the|united|states|of|america no one should go broke because get sick and insurance company will be require to cover with no extra charge routine checkup and preventive care like mammogram and colonoscopy because there be no reason should not be catch disease like breast cancer and colon cancer before get bad that make sense save money and save life now that be what americans who have health insurance can expect from this plan more security and more stability now if be of the|tens|of|million of americans who do not currently have health insurance the second part of this plan will finally offer quality affordable choice if lose job or change job will be able to get coverage if strike out on own and start a small business will be able to get coverage will do this by create a new insurance exchange a marketplace where individual and small business will be able to shop for health insurance at competitive price insurance company will have an incentive to participate in this exchange because let compete for million of new customer as big group these customer will have great leverage to bargain with the insurance company for well price and quality coverage this be how large company and government employee get affordable insurance be how everyone in this congress get affordable insurance and be time to give every american the same opportunity that give now for those individual and small business who still can not afford the lower price insurance available in the exchange will provide tax credit the size of which will be base on need and all insurance company that want access to this new marketplace will have to abide by the consumer protection already mention this exchange will take effect in which will give time to do right in the meantime for those americans who can not get insurance today because have preexist medical condition will immediately offer low cost coverage that will protect against financial ruin if become seriously ill this be a good idea when senator john|mccain propose in the campaign be a good idea now and should all embrace now even if provide these affordable option there may be those especially the young and the healthy who still want to take the risk and go without coverage there may still be company that refuse to do right by worker by give coverage the problem be such irresponsible behavior cost all the rest of money if there be affordable option and people still do not sign up for health insurance mean pay for these people 's expensive emergency room visit if some business do not provide worker health care force the rest of to pick up the tab when worker get sick and give those business an unfair advantage over competitor and unless everybody do part many of the insurance reform seek especially require insurance company to cover preexist condition just can not be achieve and that be why under plan individual will be require to carry basic health insurance just as most state require to carry auto insurance likewise business will be require to either offer worker health care or chip in to help cover the cost of worker there will be a hardship waiver for those individual who still can not afford coverage and of all small business because of size and narrow profit margin would be exempt from these requirement but can not have large business and individual who can afford coverage game the system by avoid responsibility to or employee improve health care system only work if everybody do part and while there remain some significant detail to be iron out believe a broad consensus exist for the aspect of the plan just outline consumer protection for those with insurance an exchange that allow individual and small business to purchase affordable coverage and a requirement that people who can afford insurance get insurance and have no doubt that these reform would greatly benefit americans from all walk of life as well as the economy as a whole still give all the misinformation that be be spread over the|past|few|month realize that many americans have grow nervous about reform so tonight want to address some of the key controversy that be still out there some of people 's concern have grow out of bogus claim spread by those whose only agenda be to kill reform at any cost the good example be the claim make not just by radio and cable talk show host but by prominent politician that plan to set up panel of bureaucrat with the power to kill off senior citizen now such a charge would be laughable if be not so cynical and irresponsible be a lie plain and simple now there be also those who claim that reform effort would insure illegal immigrant this too be false the reform be propose would not apply to those who be here illegally representative joe|wilson lie the president be not true and more misunderstanding want to clear up under plan no federal dollar will be use to fund abortion and federal conscience law will remain in place now health care proposal have also be attack by some who oppose reform as a government takeover of the entire health care system as proof critic point to a provision in plan that allow the uninsured and small business to choose a publicly sponsor insurance option administer by the government just like medicaid or medicare so let set the record straight here guide principle be and always have be that consumer do better when there be choice and competition that be how the market work unfortunately in 34|states of the insurance market be control by or few company in alabama almost|90|percent be control by just company and without competition the price of insurance go up and quality go down and make easy for insurance company to treat customer badly by cherry pick the healthy individual and try to drop the sick by overcharge small business who have no leverage and by jack up rate insurance executive do not do this because be bad people do because be profitable as former insurance executive testify before congress insurance company be not only encourage to find reason to drop the seriously ill be reward for all of this be in service of meeting what this former executive call wall street 's relentless profit expectation now have no interest in put insurance company out of business provide a legitimate service and employ a lot of friend and neighbor just want to hold accountable and the insurance reform that have already mention would do just that but an additional step can take to keep insurance company honest be by make a not for profit public option available in the insurance exchange now let be clear let be clear would only be an option for those who do not have insurance no one would be force to choose and would not impact those of who already have insurance in fact base on congressional|budget|office estimate believe that less|than|5|percent of americans would sign up despite all this the insurance company and ally do not like this idea argue that these private company can not fairly compete with the government and would be right if taxpayer be subsidize this public insurance option but will not be have insist that like any private insurance company the public insurance option would have to be self sufficient and rely on the premium collect but by avoid some of the overhead that get eat up at private company by profit and excessive administrative cost and executive salary could provide a good deal for consumer and would also keep pressure on private insurer to keep policy affordable and treat customer better the same way public college and university provide additional choice and competition to student without in any way inhibit a vibrant system of private college and university now be worth note that a strong majority of americans still favor a public insurance option of the sort have propose tonight but impact should not be exaggerate by the left or the right or the medium be only|one part of plan and should not be use as a handy excuse for the usual washington ideological battle to progressive friend would remind that for decade the drive idea behind reform have be to end insurance company abuse and make coverage available for those without the public option be only a means to that end and should remain open to other idea that accomplish ultimate goal and to republican friend say that rather than make wild claim about a government takeover of health care should work together to address any legitimate concern may have now for example some have suggest that the public option go into effect only in those market where insurance company be not provide affordable policy other have propose a co - op or another nonprofit entity to administer the plan these be all constructive idea worth explore but will not back down on the basic principle that if americans can not find affordable coverage will provide with a choice and will make sure that no government bureaucrat or insurance company bureaucrat get between and the care that need finally let discuss an issue that be a great concern to to member of this chamber and to the public and that be how pay for this plan and here be what need to know first will not sign a plan that add dime to deficit either now or in the future will not sign if add dime to the deficit now or in the future period and to prove that be serious there will be a provision in this plan that require to come forward with more spending cut if the saving have promise do not materialize now part of the reason face a dollar deficit when walk in the door of the|white|house be because too many initiative over the|last|decade be not pay for from the|iraq|war to tax break for the wealthy will not make that same mistake with health care have estimate that most of this plan can be pay for by find saving within the exist health care system a system that be currently full of waste and abuse right now too much of the hard earn saving and tax dollar spend on health care do not make any healthier that be not judgment be the judgment of medical professional across this country and this be also true when come to medicare and medicaid in fact want to speak directly to senior for a moment because medicare be another issue that be be subject to demagoguery and distortion during the course of this debate more|than|four|decades|ago this nation stand up for the principle that after a lifetime of hard work senior should not be leave to struggle with a pile of medical bill in their|later|year that be how medicare be bear and remain a sacred trust that must be pass down from generation to the next and that be why not a dollar of the medicare trust fund will be use to pay for this plan the only thing this plan would eliminate be the|hundreds|of|billions|of|dollar in waste and fraud as well as unwarranted subsidy in medicare that go to insurance company subsidy that do everything to pad profit but do not improve the care of senior and will also create an independent commission of doctor and medical expert charge with identify more waste in the|years|ahead now these step will ensure that america 's senior get the benefit have be promise will ensure that medicare be there for future generation and can use some of the saving to fill the gap in coverage that force too many senior to pay thousands|of|dollar a year out of own pocket for prescription drug that be what this plan will do for so do not pay attention to those scary story about how benefit will be cut especially since some of the same folk who be spread these tall tale have fight against medicare in the past and just this|year support a budget that would essentially have turn medicare into a privatized voucher program that will not happen on watch will protect medicare now because medicare be such a big part of the health care system make the program more efficient can help usher in change in the way deliver health care that can reduce cost for everybody have long know that some place like the|intermountain|healthcare in utah or the|geisinger|health|system in rural pennsylvania offer high quality care at cost below average so the commission can help encourage the adoption of these commonsense good practice by doctor and medical professional throughout the system everything from reduce hospital infection rate to encourage well coordination between team of doctor reduce the waste and inefficiency in medicare and medicaid will pay for most of this plan now much of the rest would be pay for with revenue from the very same drug and insurance company that stand to benefit from tens|of|million of new customer and this reform will charge insurance company a fee for most expensive policy which will encourage to provide great value for the money an idea which have the support of democratic and republican expert and accord to these same expert this modest change could help hold down the cost of health care for all of in the long run now finally many in this chamber particularly on the republican side of the aisle have long insist that reform medical malpractice law can help bring down the cost of health care now there go there go now do not believe malpractice reform be a silver bullet but have talk to enough doctor to know that defensive medicine may be contribute to unnecessary cost so be propose that move forward on a range of idea about how to put patient safety first and let doctor focus on practice medicine know that the bush administration consider authorize demonstration project in individual states to test these idea think be a good idea and be direct secretary of health|and|human|service to move forward on this initiative today now add all up and the plan be propose will cost around|$900|billion over less than have spend on the iraq and afghanistan war and less than the tax cut for the wealthy few americans that congress pass at the beginning of the previous administration now most of these cost will be pay for with money already be spend but spend badly in the exist health care system the plan will not add to deficit the middle class will realize great security not high taxis and if be able to slow the growth of health care cost by just|one tenth of each year tenth of — will actually reduce the deficit by over the long term now this be the plan be propose be a plan that incorporate idea from many of the people in this room tonight democrats and republicans and will continue to seek common ground in the|weeks|ahead if come to with a serious set of proposal will be there to listen door be always open but know this will not waste time with those who have make the calculation that be well politic to kill this plan than to improve will not stand by while the special interest use the same old tactic to keep thing exactly the way be if misrepresent what be in this plan will call out and will not accept the status quo as a solution not this time not now everyone in this room know what will happen if do nothing deficit will grow more family will go bankrupt more business will close more americans will lose coverage when be sick and need the most and more will die as a result know these thing to be true that be why can not fail because there be too many americans count on to succeed the one who suffer silently and the one who share story with at town hall in e mail and in letter receive of those letter a|few|days|ago be from beloved friend and colleague ted|kennedy have write back in may shortly after be tell that illness be terminal ask that be deliver upon death in speak about what a happy time last|month be thank to the love and support of family and friend wife vicki amazing child who be all here tonight and express confidence that this would be the|year that health care reform that great unfinished business of society call would finally pass repeat the truth that health care be decisive for future prosperity but also remind that concern more than material thing what face write be above all a moral issue at stake be not just the detail of policy but fundamental principle of social justice and the character of country have think about that phrase quite a bit in recent|day the character of country of the unique and wonderful thing about america have always be self reliance rugged individualism fierce defense of freedom and healthy skepticism of government and figure out the appropriate size and role of government have always be a source of rigorous and yes sometimes angry debate that be history for some of ted|kennedy 's critic brand of liberalism represent an affront to american liberty in mind passion for universal health care be nothing more than a passion for big government but those of who know teddy and work with here people of both party know that what drive be something more friend know that work together to provide child with health insurance friend john|mccain know that work together on a patient 's bill of right friend chuck|grassley know that work together to provide health care to child with disability on issue like these ted|kennedy 's passion be bear not of some rigid ideology but of own experience be the experience of have child stricken with cancer never forget the sheer terror and helplessness that any parent feel when a child be badly sick and be able to imagine what must be like for those without insurance what would be like to have to say to a wife or a child or an age parent there be something that could make well but just can not afford that large heartedness that concern and regard for the plight of other be not a partisan feeling be not a republican or a democratic feeling too be part of the american character ability to stand in other people 's shoe a recognition that be all in this together and when fortune turn against of other be there to lend a help hand a belief that in this country hard work and responsibility should be reward by some measure of security and fair play and an acknowledgment that sometimes government have to step in to help deliver on that promise this have always be the history of progress in when over|half of senior could not support and million have see saving wipe away there be those who argue that social|security would lead to socialism but the man and woman of congress stand fast and be all the well for in when some argue that medicare represent a government takeover of health care member of congress democrats and republicans do not back down join together so that all of could enter our|golden|years with some basic peace of mind see predecessor understand that government could not and should not solve every problem understand that there be instance when the gain in security from government action be not worth the add constraint on freedom but also understand that the danger of too much government be match by the peril of too little that without the leavening hand of wise policy market can crash monopoly can stifle competition the vulnerable can be exploit and know that when any government measure no matter how carefully craft or beneficial be subject to scorn when any effort to help people in need be attack as un - american when fact and reason be throw overboard and only timidity pass for wisdom and can no longer even engage in a civil conversation with each other over the thing that truly matter that at that point do not merely lose capacity to solve big challenge lose something essential about that be true then remain true today understand how difficult this health care debate have be know that many in this country be deeply skeptical that government be look out for understand that the politically safe move would be to kick the can further down the road to defer reform more year or more election or more term but that be not what the moment call for that be not what come here to do do not come to fear the future come here to shape still believe can act even when be hard still believe still believe that can act when be hard still believe can replace acrimony with civility and gridlock with progress still believe can do great thing and that here and now will meet history 's test because that be who be that be calling that be character thank god bless and may god bless the|united|states|of|america view transcript transcript thank so much good afternoon be honor to be in the timeless city of cairo and to be host by remarkable institution for over|a|thousand|years al azhar have stand as a beacon of islamic learning and for over|a|century cairo|university have be a source of egypt 's advancement and together represent the harmony between tradition and progress be grateful for hospitality and the hospitality of the people of egypt and be also proud to carry with the good will of the american people and a greeting of peace from muslim community in country as salaamu alaykum meet at a time of great tension between the|united|state and muslims around the world tension root in historical force that go beyond any current policy debate the relationship between islam and the west include century of coexistence and cooperation but also conflict and religious war more recently tension have be feed by colonialism that deny right and opportunity to many muslims and a cold war in which muslim majority country be too often treat as proxy without regard to own aspiration moreover the sweeping change bring by modernity and globalization lead many muslims to view the west as hostile to the tradition of islam violent extremist have exploit these tension in a small but potent minority of muslims the attack of september|11,|2001 and the continued effort of these extremist to engage in violence against civilian have lead some in country to view islam as inevitably hostile not only to america and western country but also to human right all this have breed more fear and more mistrust so long as relationship be define by difference will empower those who sow hatred rather than peace those who promote conflict rather than the cooperation that can help all of people achieve justice and prosperity and this cycle of suspicion and discord must end have come here to cairo to seek a new beginning between the|united|state and muslims around the world base on mutual interest and mutual respect and base upon the truth that america and islam be not exclusive and nee not be in competition instead overlap and share common principle principle of justice and progress tolerance and the dignity of all human being do so recognize that change can not happen overnight know there be be a lot of publicity about this speech but no single speech can|eradicate|years of mistrust nor can answer in the time that have this|afternoon all the complex question that bring to this point but be convinced that in order to move forward must say openly to each other the thing hold in heart and that too often be say only behind closed door there must be a sustained effort to listen to each other to learn from each other to respect another and to seek common ground as the|holy|koran tell be conscious of god and speak always the truth that be what will try to do today to speak the truth as best can humble by the task before and firm in belief that the interest share as human being be far more powerful than the force that drive apart now part of this conviction be root in own experience be a christian but father come from a kenyan family that include generation of muslims as a boy spend several|years in indonesia and hear the call of the azaan at the break of dawn and at the fall of dusk as a young man work in chicago community where many find dignity and peace in muslim faith as a student of history also know civilization 's debt to islam be islam at place like al azhar that carry the light of learn through so many century pave the way for europe 's renaissance and enlightenment be innovation in muslim community that develop the order of algebra magnetic compass and tool of navigation mastery of pen and printing understanding of how disease spread and how can be heal islamic culture have give majestic arch and soar spire timeless poetry and cherish music elegant calligraphy and place of peaceful contemplation and throughout history islam have demonstrate through word and deed the possibility of religious tolerance and racial equality also know that islam have always be a part of america 's story the first nation to recognize country be morocco in sign the|treaty|of|tripoli in second president john|adams write the|united|state have in no character of enmity against the law religion or tranquillity of muslims and since founding american|muslim have enrich the|united|state have fight in war have serve in government have stand for civil right have start business have teach at university have excel in sport arena have win nobel|prizes build tall building and light the|olympic|torch and when the first muslim|american be recently elect to congress take the oath to defend constitution use the same holy|koran that of founding|father thomas|jefferson keep in personal library so have know islam on continent before come to the region where be first reveal that experience guide conviction that partnership between america and islam must be base on what islam be not what be not and consider part of responsibility as president of the|united|state to fight against negative stereotype of islam wherever appear but that same principle must apply to muslim perception of america just as muslims do not fit a crude stereotype america be not the crude stereotype of a self interested empire the|united|state have be of the great source of progress that the world have ever know be bear out of revolution against an empire be found upon the ideal that all be create equal and have shed blood and struggle for century to give meaning to those word within border and around the world be shape by every culture draw from every end of the earth and dedicate to a simple concept e pluribus unum—"out of many now much have be make of the fact that an african american with the name barack|hussein|obama could be elect president but personal story be not so unique the dream of opportunity for all people have not come true for everyone in america but promise exist for all who come to shore and that include nearly american|muslims in country today who by the way enjoy income and educational level that be high than the american average moreover freedom in america be indivisible from the freedom to practice one 's religion that be why there be a mosque in every state in union and over|1,200 mosque within border that be why the|united|states|government have go to court to protect the right of woman and girl to wear the hijab and to punish those who would deny so let there be no doubt islam be a part of america and believe that america hold within the truth that regardless of race religion or station in life all of share common aspiration to live in peace and security to get an education and to work with dignity to love family community and god these thing share this be the hope of all humanity of course recognize common humanity be only the beginning of task word alone can not meet the need of people these need will be meet only if act boldly in the|years|ahead and if understand that the challenge face be share and failure to meet will hurt all for have learn from recent experience that when a financial system weaken in country prosperity be hurt everywhere when a new flu infect human being all be at risk when nation pursue a nuclear weapon the risk of nuclear attack rise for all nation when violent extremist operate in stretch of mountain people be endanger across an ocean when innocent in bosnia and darfur be slaughter that be a stain on collective conscience that be what mean to share this world in the|21st|century that be the responsibility have to one another as human being and this be a difficult responsibility to embrace for human history have often be a record of nation and tribe and yes religion subjugate another in pursuit of own interest yet in this new age such attitude be self defeat give interdependence any world order that elevate nation or group of people over another will inevitably fail so whatever think of the past must not be prisoner to problem must be deal with through partnership progress must be share now that do not mean should ignore source of tension indeed suggest the opposite must face these tension squarely and so in that spirit let speak as clearly and as plainly as can about some specific issue that believe must finally confront together the first issue that have to confront be violent extremism in all of form in ankara make clear that america be not and never will be at war with islam will however relentlessly confront violent extremist who pose a grave threat to security because reject the same thing that people of all faith reject the killing of innocent man woman and child and be first duty as president to protect the american people the situation in afghanistan demonstrate america 's goal and need to work together over the|united|state pursue and the taliban with broad international support do not go by choice go because of necessity be aware that there be still some who would question or even justify the event of but let be clear kill nearly|3,000 people on that|day the victim be innocent man woman and child from america and many other nation who have do nothing to harm anybody and yet choose to ruthlessly murder these people claim credit for the attack and even now state determination to kill on a massive scale have affiliate in many country and be try to expand reach these be not opinion to be debate these be fact to be deal with make no mistake do not want to keep troop in afghanistan see no — seek no military basis there be agonizing for america to lose young man and woman be costly and politically difficult to continue this conflict would gladly bring every single of troop home if could be confident that there be not violent extremist in afghanistan and now pakistan determine to kill as many americans as possibly can but that be not yet the case and that be why be partner with a coalition of country and despite the cost involve america 's commitment will not weaken indeed none of should tolerate these extremist have kill in many country have kill people of different faith but more than any other have kill muslims action be irreconcilable with the right of human being the progress of nation and with islam the holy koran teach that whoever kill an innocent be as—"it be as if have kill all mankind and the|holy|koran also say whoever save a person be as if have save all mankind the endure faith of over a people be so much big than the narrow hatred of a few islam be not part of the problem in combat violent extremism be an important part of promote peace now also know that military power alone be not go to solve the problem in afghanistan and pakistan that be why plan to invest each|year over the|next|5|years to partner with pakistanis to build school and hospital road and business and hundreds|of|million to help those who have be displace that be why be provide to help afghans develop economy and deliver service that people depend on let also address the issue of iraq unlike afghanistan iraq be a war of choice that provoke strong difference in country and around the world although believe that the iraqi people be ultimately better off without the tyranny of saddam|hussein also believe that event in iraq have remind america of the need to use diplomacy and build international consensus to resolve problem whenever possible indeed can recall the word of thomas|jefferson who say hope that wisdom will grow with power and teach that the less use power the great will be today america have a dual responsibility to help iraq forge a well future and to leave iraq to iraqis and have make clear to the iraqi people that pursue no basis and no claim on territory or resource iraq 's sovereignty be own and that be why order the removal of combat brigade by next|august that be why will honor agreement with iraq 's democratically elect government to remove combat troop from iraqi city by july and to remove all of troop from iraq by will help iraq train security force and develop economy but will support a secure and united iraq as a partner and never as a patron and finally just as america can never tolerate violence by extremist must never alter or forget principle eleven be an enormous trauma to country the fear and anger that provoke be understandable but in some case lead to act contrary to tradition and ideal be take concrete action to change course have unequivocally prohibit the use of torture by the|united|state and have order the prison at guantanamo|bay close by early|next|year so america will defend respectful of the sovereignty of nation and the rule of law and will do so in partnership with muslim community which be also threaten the sooner the extremist be isolate and unwelcome in muslim community the sooner will all be safe the second major source of tension that need to discuss be the situation between israelis palestinians and the arab world america 's strong bond with israel be well know this bond be unbreakable be base upon cultural and historical tie and the recognition that the aspiration for a jewish homeland be root in a tragic history that can not be deny around the world the jewish people be persecute for century and anti - semitism in europe culminate in an unprecedented holocaust tomorrow will visit buchenwald which be part of a network of camp where jews be enslave torture shot and gas to death by the|third|reich six|million jews be kill more than the entire jewish population of israel today deny that fact be baseless be ignorant and be hateful threaten israel with destruction or repeat vile stereotype about jews be deeply wrong and only serve to evoke in the mind of israelis this most painful of memory while prevent the peace that the people of this region deserve on the other hand be also undeniable that the palestinian people muslims and christians have suffer in pursuit of a homeland for more|than|60|year have endure the pain of dislocation many wait in refugee camp in gaza and neighboring land for a life of peace and security that have never be able to lead endure the daily humiliation large and small that come with occupation so let there be no doubt the situation for the palestinian people be intolerable and america will not turn back on the legitimate palestinian aspiration for dignity opportunity and a state of own for decade then there have be a stalemate people with legitimate aspiration each with a painful history that make compromise elusive be easy to point finger for palestinians to point to the displacement bring about by israel 's founding and for israelis to point to the constant hostility and attack throughout history from within border as well as beyond but if see this conflict only from side or the other then will be blind to the truth the only resolution be for the aspiration of both side to be meet through state where israelis and palestinians each live in peace and security that be in israel 's interest palestine 's interest america 's interest and the world 's interest and that be why intend to personally pursue this outcome with all the patience and dedication that the task require the obligation that the party have agree to under the road map be clear for peace to come be time for and all of to live up to responsibility palestinians must abandon violence resistance through violence and killing be wrong and do not succeed for century black people in america suffer the lash of the whip as slave and the humiliation of segregation but be not violence that win full and equal right be a peaceful and determined insistence upon the ideal at the center of america 's founding this same story can be tell by people from south|africa to south|asia from to indonesia be a story with a simple truth violence be a dead end be a sign neither of courage nor power to shoot rocket at sleep child or to blow up old woman on a bus that be not how moral authority be claim that be how be surrender now be the time for palestinians to focus on what can build the|palestinian|authority must develop capacity to govern with institution that serve the need of people hamas do have support among some palestinians but also have to recognize have responsibility to play a role in fulfil palestinian aspiration to unify the palestinian people hamas must put an end to violence recognize past agreement recognize israel 's right to exist at the same time israelis must acknowledge that just as israel 's right to exist can not be deny neither can palestine 's the|united|state do not accept the legitimacy of continue israeli settlement this construction violate previous agreement and undermine effort to achieve peace be time for these settlement to stop and israel must also live up to obligation to ensure that palestinians can live and work and develop society just as devastate palestinian family the continue humanitarian crisis in gaza do not serve israel 's security neither do the continue lack of opportunity in progress in the daily life of the palestinian people must be a critical part of a road to peace and israel must take concrete step to enable such progress and finally the|arab|state must recognize that the arab peace initiative be an important beginning but not the end of responsibility the arab israeli conflict should no longer be use to distract the people of arab nation from other problem instead must be a cause for action to help the palestinian people develop the institution that will sustain state to recognize israel 's legitimacy and to choose progress over a self defeat focus on the past america will align policy with those who pursue peace and will say in public what say in private to israelis and palestinians and arabs can not impose peace but privately many muslims recognize that israel will not go away likewise many israelis recognize the need for a palestinian state be time for to act on what everyone know to be true too many tear have be shed too much blood have be shed all of have a responsibility to work for the|day when the mother of israelis and palestinians can see child grow up without fear when of the great faith be the place of peace that god intend to be when jerusalem be a secure and lasting home for jews and christians and muslims and a place for all of the child of abraham to mingle peacefully together as in the story of isra when moses jesus and muhammed peace be upon join in prayer the third source of tension be share interest in the right and responsibility of nation on nuclear weapon this issue have be a source of tension between the|united|state and the|islamic|republic|of|iran for many|years iran have define in part by opposition to country and there be in fact a tumultuous history between in the middle of the cold war the|united|state play a role in the overthrow of a democratically elect iranian|government since the|islamic|revolution iran have play a role in act of hostage taking and violence against u.s. troop and civilian this history be well know rather than remain trap in the past have make clear to iran 's leader and people that country be prepared to move forward the question now be not what iran be against but rather what future want to build recognize will be hard to overcome decade of mistrust but will proceed with courage rectitude and resolve there will be many issue to discuss between country and be willing to move forward without precondition on the basis of mutual respect but be clear to all concerned that when come to nuclear weapon have reach a decisive point this be not simply about america 's interest be about prevent a nuclear arm race in the|middle|east that could lead this region and the world down a hugely dangerous path understand those who protest that some country have weapon that other do not no single nation should pick and choose which nation hold nuclear weapon and that be why strongly reaffirm america 's commitment to seek a world in which no nation hold nuclear weapon and any nation include iran should have the right to access peaceful nuclear power if comply with responsibility under the|nuclear|non proliferation|treaty that commitment be at the core of the treaty and must be keep for all who fully abide by and be hopeful that all country in the region can share in this goal the fourth issue that will address be democracy know there have be controversy about the promotion of democracy in recent|years and much of this controversy be connect to the war in iraq so let be clear no system of government can or should be impose by nation by any other that do not lessen commitment however to government that reflect the will of the people each nation give life to this principle in own way ground in the tradition of own people america do not presume to know what be good for everyone just as would not presume to pick the outcome of a peaceful election but do have an unyielding belief that all people yearn for certain thing the ability to speak mind and have a say in how be govern confidence in the rule of law and the equal administration of justice government that be transparent and do not steal from the people the freedom to live as choose these be not just american idea be human right and that be why will support everywhere now there be no straight line to realize this promise but this much be clear government that protect these right be ultimately more stable successful and secure suppress idea never succeed in make go away america respect the right of all peaceful and law abide voice to be hear around the world even if disagree with and will welcome all elect peaceful government provide govern with respect for all people this last point be important because there be some who advocate for democracy only when be out of power once in power be ruthless in suppress the right of other so no matter where take hold government of the people and by the people set a single standard for all who would hold power must maintain power through consent not coercion must respect the right of minority and participate with a spirit of tolerance and compromise must place the interest of people and the legitimate working of the political process above party without these ingredient election alone do not make true democracy audience member love the president thank the fifth issue that must address together be religious freedom islam have a proud tradition of tolerance see in the history of andalusia and cordoba during the inquisition see firsthand as a child in indonesia where devout christians worship freely in an overwhelmingly muslim country that be the spirit need today people in every country should be free to choose and live faith base upon the persuasion of the mind and the heart and the soul this tolerance be essential for religion to thrive but be be challenge in many different way among some muslims there be a disturbing tendency to measure one 's own faith by the rejection of somebody else 's faith the richness of religious diversity must be uphold whether be for maronites in lebanon or the copts in egypt and if be be honest fault line must be close among muslims as well as the division between sunni and shi'a have lead to tragic violence particularly in iraq freedom of religion be central to the ability of people to live together must always examine the way in which protect for instance in the|united|state rule on charitable giving have make harder for muslims to fulfill religious obligation that be why be committed to work with american|muslims to ensure that can fulfill zakat likewise be important for western country to avoid impede muslim citizen from practice religion as see fit for instance by dictate what clothe a muslim woman should wear can not disguise hostility towards any religion behind the pretence of liberalism in fact faith should bring together and that be why be forge service project in america to bring together christians muslims and jews that be why welcome effort like saudi|arabian king abdallah 's interfaith dialog and turkey 's leadership in the|alliance|of|civilization around the world can turn dialog into interfaith service so bridge between people lead to action whether be combat malaria in africa or provide relief after a natural disaster the sixth issue that want to address be woman 's right know—[applause]—i know and can tell from this audience that there be a healthy debate about this issue reject the view of some in the west that a woman who choose to cover hair be somehow less equal but do believe that a woman who be deny an education be deny equality and be no coincidence that country where woman be well educate be far more likely to be prosperous now let be clear issue of woman 's equality be by no means simply an issue for islam in turkey pakistan bangladesh indonesia have see muslim majority country elect a woman to lead meanwhile the struggle for woman 's equality continue in many aspect of american life and in country around the world be convinced that daughter can contribute just as much to society as son common prosperity will be advance by allow all humanity man and woman to reach full potential do not believe that woman must make the same choice as man in order to be equal and respect those woman who choose to live life in traditional role but should be choice and that be why the|united|state will partner with any muslim majority country to support expand literacy for girl and to help young woman pursue employment through microfinancing that help people live dream finally want to discuss economic development and opportunity know that for many the face of globalization be contradictory the internet and television can bring knowledge and information but also offensive sexuality and mindless violence into the home trade can bring new wealth and opportunity but also huge disruption and change in community in all nation include america this change can bring fear fear that because of modernity lose control over economic choice politic and most importantly identity those thing most cherish about community family tradition and faith but also know that human progress can not be deny there need not be contradiction between development and tradition country like japan and south|korea grow economy enormously while maintain distinct culture the same be true for the astonishing progress within muslim majority country from kuala|lumpur to dubai in ancient time and in time muslim community have be at the forefront of innovation and education and this be important because no development strategy can be base only upon what come out of the ground nor can be sustain while young people be out of work many|gulf|state have enjoy great wealth as a consequence of oil and some be begin to focus on broad development but all of must recognize that education and innovation will be the currency of the|21st|century and in too many muslim community there remain underinvestment in these area be emphasize such investment within own country and while america in the past have focus on oil and gas when come to this part of the world now seek a broad engagement on education will expand exchange program and increase scholarship like the one that bring father to america at the same time will encourage more americans to study in muslim community and will match promise muslim student with internship in america invest in online learning for teacher and child around the world and create a new online network so a young person in kansas can communicate instantly with a young person in cairo on economic development will create a new corps of business volunteer to partner with counterpart in muslim majority country and will host a summit on entrepreneurship this year to identify how can deepen tie between business leader foundation and social entrepreneur in the|united|state and muslim community around the world on science and technology will launch a new fund to support technological development in muslim majority country and to help transfer idea to mark to the marketplace so can create more job will open center of scientific excellence in africa the|middle|east and southeast|asia and appoint new science envoy to collaborate on program that develop new source of energy create green job digitize record clean water grow new crop today be announce a new global effort with the|organization|of|the|islamic|conference to eradicate polio and will also expand partnership with muslim community to promote child and maternal health all these thing must be do in partnership americans be ready to join with citizen and government community organization religious leader and business in muslim community around the world to help people pursue a well life and the issue that have describe will not be easy to address but have a responsibility to join together on behalf of the world that seek a world where extremist no longer threaten people and american troop have come home a world where israelis and palestinians be each secure in a state of own and nuclear energy be use for peaceful purpose a world where government serve citizen and the right of all god 's child be respect those be mutual interest that be the world seek but can only achieve together know there be many muslim and non - muslim who question whether can forge this new beginning some be eager to stoke the flame of division and to stand in the way of progress some suggest that be not worth the effort that be fat to disagree and civilization be doom to clash many more be simply skeptical that real change can occur there be so much fear so much mistrust that have build up over the|year but if choose to be bind by the past will never move forward and want to particularly say this to young people of every faith in every country more than anyone have the ability to reimagine the world to remake this world all of share this world for but a brief moment in time the question be whether spend that time focus on what push apart or whether commit to an effort a sustained effort to find common ground to focus on the future seek for child and to respect the dignity of all human being be easy to start war than to end be easy to blame other than to look inward be easy to see what be different about someone than to find the thing share but should choose the right path not just the easy path there be rule that lie at the heart of every religion that do unto other as would have do unto this truth transcend nation and people a belief that be not new that be not black or white or brown that be not christian or muslim or jew be a belief that pulse in the cradle of civilization and that still beat in the heart of billion around the world be a faith in other people and be what bring here today have the power to make the world seek but only if have the courage to make a new beginning keep in mind what have be write the holy koran tell o mankind have create male and a female and have make into nation and tribe so that may know another the talmud tell the whole of the torah be for the purpose of promote peace tell blessed be the peacemaker for shall be call son of god the people of the world can live together in peace know that be god 's vision now that must be

transcript transcript madam speaker mr. vice president members of congress the first lady of the|united|state be around here somewhere have come here tonight not only to address the distinguished man and woman in this great chamber but to speak frankly and directly to the man and woman who send here know that for many americans watch right now the state of economy be a concern that rise above all other and rightly so if have not be personally affect by this recession probably know someone who have a friend a neighbor a member of family do not need to hear another list of statistic to know that economy be in crisis because live every day be the worry wake up with and the source of sleepless night be the job think would retire from but now have lose the business build dream upon that be now hang by a thread the college acceptance letter child have to put back in the envelope the impact of this recession be real and be everywhere but while economy may be weaken and confidence shake though be live through difficult and uncertain time tonight want every american to know this will rebuild will recover and the|united|states|of|america will emerge strong than before the weight of this crisis will not determine the destiny of this nation the answer to problem do not lie beyond reach exist in laboratory and university in field and factory in the imagination of entrepreneur and the pride of the hardest work people on earth those quality that have make america the great force of progress and prosperity in human history still possess in ample measure what be require now be for this country to pull together confront boldly the challenge face and take responsibility for future once more now if be honest with will admit that for too long have not always meet these responsibility as a government or as a people say this not to lay blame or to look backwards but because be only by understand how arrive at this moment that will be able to lift out of this predicament the fact be economy do not fall into decline overnight nor do all of problem begin when the housing market collapse or the stock market sink have know for decade that survival depend on find new source of energy yet import more oil today than ever before the cost of health care eat up more and more of saving each|year yet keep delay reform child will compete for job in a global economy that too many of school do not prepare for and though all these challenge go unsolved still manage to spend more money and pile up more debt both as individual and through government than ever before in other word have live through an era where too often short term gain be prize over long term prosperity where fail to look beyond the next payment the|next|quarter or the next election a surplus become an excuse to transfer wealth to the wealthy instead of an opportunity to invest in future regulation be gutte for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market people buy home know could not afford from bank and lender who push those bad loan anyway and all the while critical debate and difficult decision be put off for some other time on well that|day of reckoning have arrive and the time to take charge of future be here now be the time to act boldly and wisely to not only revive this economy but to build a new foundation for last prosperity now be the time to jumpstart job creation restart lending and invest in area like energy health care and education that will grow economy even as make hard choice to bring deficit down that be what economic agenda be design to do and that be what would like to talk to about tonight be an agenda that begin with job as soon as take office ask this congress to send a recovery plan by president 's day that would put people back to work and put money in pocket not because believe in big government don't — not because be not mindful of the massive debt have inherit be call for action because the failure to do so would have cost more job and cause more hardship in fact a failure to act would have worsen long term deficit by assure weak economic growth for year and that be why push for quick action and tonight be grateful that this congress deliver and pleased to say that the|american|recovery|and|reinvestment|act be now law over the|next|2|years this plan will save or create job more|than|90|percent of these job will be in the private sector job rebuild road and bridge construct wind turbine and solar panel lay broadband and expand mass transit because of this plan there be teacher who can now keep job and educate kid health care professional can continue care for sick there be police officer who be still on the street of minneapolis tonight because this plan prevent the layoff department be about to make because of this plan of work household in america will receive a tax cut a tax cut that will see in paycheck begin on april|1st because of this plan family who be struggle to pay tuition cost will receive a tax credit for all|4|year of college and americans who have lose job in this recession will be able to receive extended unemployment benefit and continue health care coverage to help weather this storm now know there be some in this chamber and watch at home who be skeptical of whether this plan will work and understand that skepticism here in washington have all see how quickly good intention can turn into broken promise and wasteful spending and with a plan of this scale come enormous responsibility to get right and that be why have ask vice president biden to lead a tough unprecedented oversight effort because nobody mess with joe — be right do not mess with have tell each of cabinet as well as mayor and governors across the country that will be hold accountable by and the american people for every dollar spend have appoint a prove and aggressive inspector general to ferret out any and all case of waste and fraud and have create a new web site call so that every american can find out how and where money be be spend so the recovery plan pass be the first step in get economy back on track but be just the first step because even if manage this plan flawlessly there will be no real recovery unless clean up the credit crisis that have severely weaken financial system want to speak plainly and candidly about this issue tonight because every american should know that directly affect and family 's well being should also know that the money have deposit in bank across the country be safe insurance be secure can rely on the continued operation of financial system that be not the source of concern the concern be that if do not restart lending in this country recovery will be choke off before even begin see the flow of credit be the lifeblood of economy the ability to get a loan be how finance the purchase of everything from a home to a car to a college education how store stock shelf farm buy equipment and business make payroll but credit have stop flow the way should too many bad loan from the housing crisis have make way onto the book of too many bank and with so much debt and so little confidence these bank be now fearful of lend out any more money to household to business or even to each other and when there be no lending family can not afford to buy home or car so business be force to make layoff economy suffer even more and credit dry up even further that be why this administration be move swiftly and aggressively to break this destructive cycle to restore confidence and restart lending and will do so in several way first be create a new lending fund that represent the large effort ever to help provide auto loan college loan and small business loan to the consumer and entrepreneur who keep this economy run second have launch a housing plan that will help responsible family face the threat of foreclosure low monthly payment and refinance mortgage be a plan that will not help speculator or that neighbor down the street who buy a house could never hope to afford but will help million of americans who be struggle with decline home value americans who will now be able to take advantage of the low interest rate that this plan have already help to bring about in fact the average family who refinance today can save per year on mortgage third will act with the full force of the|federal|government to ensure that the major bank that americans depend on have enough confidence and enough money to lend even in more difficult time and when learn that a major bank have serious problem will hold accountable those responsible force the necessary adjustment provide the support to clean up balance sheet and assure the continuity of a strong viable institution that can serve people and economy now understand that on any|given|day wall street may be more comfort by an approach that give bank bailout with no string attach and that hold nobody accountable for reckless decision but such an approach will not solve the problem and goal be to quicken the|day when restart lend to the american people and american business and end this crisis once and for all and intend to hold these bank fully accountable for the assistance receive and this time will have to clearly demonstrate how taxpayer dollar result in more lending for the american taxpayer this time ceo will not be able to use taxpayer money to pad paycheck or buy fancy drape or disappear on a private jet those|day be over still this plan will require significant resource from the|federal|government and yes probably more than have already set aside but while the cost of action will be great can assure that the cost of inaction will be far great for could result in an economy that sputter along for not month or year but perhaps a|decade that would be bad for deficit bad for business bad for and bad for the next generation and refuse to let that happen now understand that when the last administration ask this congress to provide assistance for struggle bank democrats and republicans alike be infuriate by the mismanagement and the result that follow so be the american taxpayer so be i. so know how unpopular be to be see as help bank right now especially when everyone be suffer in part from bad decision promise get but also know that in a time of crisis can not afford to govern out of anger or yield to the politic of the moment job job be to solve the problem job be to govern with a sense of responsibility will not send — will not spend a|single|penny for the purpose of reward a single wall street executive but will do whatever take to help the small business that can not pay worker or the family that have save and still can not get a mortgage that be what this be about be not about help bank be about help people—[applause]. be not about help bank be about help people because when credit be available again that young family can finally buy a new home and then some company will hire worker to build and then those worker will have money to spend and if can get a loan too maybe will finally buy that car or open own business investor will return to the market and american family will see retirement secure once more slowly but surely confidence will return and economy will recover so ask this congress to join in do whatever prove necessary because can not consign nation to an open ended recession and to ensure that a crisis of this magnitude never happen again ask congress to move quickly on legislation that will finally reform outdate regulatory system be time to put in place tough new commonsense rule of the road so that financial market reward drive and innovation and punish shortcut and abuse the recovery plan and the financial stability plan be the immediate step be take to revive economy in the short term but the only way to fully restore america 's economic strength be to make the long term investment that will lead to new job new industry and a renew ability to compete with the rest of the world the only way this|century will be another american century be if confront at last the price of dependence on oil and the high cost of health care the school that be not prepare child and the mountain of debt stand to inherit that be responsibility in the|next|few|day will submit a budget to congress so often have come to view these document as simply number on a page or a laundry list of program see this document differently see as a vision for america as a blueprint for future budget do not attempt to solve every problem or address every issue reflect the stark reality of what have inherit a dollar deficit a financial crisis and a costly recession give these reality everyone in this chamber democrats and republicans will have to sacrifice some worthy priority for which there be no dollar and that include but that do not mean can afford to ignore long term challenge reject the view that say problem will simply take care of that say government have no role in lay the foundation for common prosperity for history tell a different story history remind that at every moment of economic upheaval and transformation this nation have respond with bold action and big idea in the midst of civil|war lay railroad track from coast to another that spur commerce and industry from the turmoil of the|industrial|revolution come a system of public high school that prepare citizen for a new age in the wake of war and depression the gi bill send a generation to college and create the large middle class in history and a twilight struggle for freedom lead to a nation of highway an american on the moon and an explosion of technology that still shape world in each case government do not supplant private enterprise catalyze private enterprise create the condition for thousand of entrepreneur and new business to adapt and to thrive be a nation that have see promise amid peril and claim opportunity from ordeal now must be that nation again and that be why even as cut back on program do not need the budget submit will invest in the area that be absolutely critical to economic future energy health care and education begin with energy know the country that harness the power of clean renewable energy will lead the|21st|century and yet be china that have launch the large effort in history to make economy energy efficient invent solar technology but have fall behind country like germany and japan in produce new plug in hybrid roll off assembly line but will run on battery make in korea well do not accept a future where the job and industry of tomorrow take root beyond border and know do not either be time for america to lead again thank to recovery plan will double this nation 's supply of renewable energy in the|next|3|years have also make the large investment in basic research funding in american history an investment that will spur not only new discovery in energy but breakthrough in medicine and science and technology will soon lay down thousands|of|mile of power line that can carry new energy to city and town across this country and will put americans to work make home and building more efficient so that can save billions|of|dollar on energy bill but to truly transform economy to protect security and save planet from the ravage of climate change need to ultimately make clean renewable energy the profitable kind of energy so ask this congress to send legislation that place a market base cap on carbon pollution and drive the production of more renewable energy in america that be what need and to support that innovation will invest a year to develop technology like wind power and solar power advanced biofuel clean coal and more efficient car and truck build right here in america speak of auto industry everyone recognize that|year of bad decisionmaking and a global recession have push automaker to the brink should not and will not protect from own bad practice but be commit to the goal of a retool reimagine auto industry that can compete and win million of job depend on score of community depend on and believe the nation that invent the automobile can not walk away from now none of this will come without cost nor will be easy but this be america do not do what be easy do what be necessary to move this country forward and for that same reason must also address the crush cost of health care this be a cost that now cause a bankruptcy in america every|30|second by the|end|of|the|year could cause americans to lose home in the|last|8|year premium have grow time faster than wage and in each|of|these|year more americans have lose health insurance be of the major reason why small business close door and corporation ship job overseas and be of the large and fast grow part of budget give these fact can no longer afford to put health care reform on hold can not afford to do be time already have do more to advance the cause of health care reform in the|last|30|day than have do in the|last|decade when be days|old this congress pass a law to provide and protect health insurance for american child whose parent work full time recovery plan will invest in electronic health record a new technology that will reduce error bring down cost ensure privacy and save life will launch a new effort to conquer a disease that have touch the life of nearly every american include by seek a cure for cancer in time and make the large investment ever in preventive care because that be of the good way to keep people healthy and cost under control this budget build on these reform include a historic commitment to comprehensive health care reform a down payment on the principle that must have quality affordable health care for every american be a commitment that be pay for in part by efficiency in system that be long overdue and be a step must take if hope to bring down deficit in the|year to come now there will be many different opinion and idea about how to achieve reform and that be why be bring together business and worker doctor and health care provider democrats and republicans to begin work on this issue next|week suffer no illusion that this will be an easy process once again will be hard but also know that nearly|a|century after first call for reform the cost of health care have weigh down economy and conscience long enough so let there be no doubt health care reform can not wait must not wait and will not wait another|year the third challenge must address be the urgent need to expand the promise of education in america in a global economy where the most

be be have respect sometimes do not like the story that write or report on sometimes misunderestimate but always the relationship have feel have be professional and appreciate appreciate do appreciate work with friend say what be like to deal with the press corps say these be just people try to do the good possibly can and so here at the last press conference be interested in answer some of question but mostly be interested in say thank for the job ben q thank for those comment mr. president here be a question be wonder if plan to ask congress for the remain in bail money and in term of the timing if do that before leave office sir be motivate in part to make life a little easy for president elect obama the president have talk to the president elect about this subject and tell that if feel that need the would be willing to ask for in other word if feel need to happen on watch the good course of action of course be to convince enough member of the senate to vote positively for the for the request and know that be all can share with because that be all know q so have not make the request yet the president well have not ask to make the request yet and do not intend to make the request unless specifically ask to make be know have have third conversation with and genuinely mean what say wish all the very good have find to be a very smart and engaging person and that lunch the other day be interesting to have guy who be nearly 62-year older and a 47-year old kind of the classic generational statement and common area of all have different circumstance and experience but thing be have all experience what mean to assume the responsibility of the presidency and president elect obama be fix to do that and will get swear in and then will have the lunch and all the know all the deal up there on capitol|hill and then will come back and go through the inauguration and then will walk in the|oval|office and there will be a moment when the responsibility of the president land squarely on shoulder toby yes will get everybody q thank mr. president do believe that the gaza conflict will have end by the time leave office do approve of the way that israel have conduct and why be unable to achieve the peace deal that have seek the president remind of the point will because be get q will end the president be get a little old q will end by the time leave office do approve of the the president hope so be for a sustainable cease fire and a definition of a sustainable cease fire be that hamas stop fire rocket into israel and there will not be a sustainable cease fire if continue fire rocket happen to believe the choice be hamas 's to make and believe that the good way to ensure that there be a sustainable cease fire be to work with egypt to stop the smuggling of arm into the gaza that enable hamas to continue to fire rocket and so country that supply weapon to hamas have get to stop and the international community need to continue to pressure to stop provide weapon hamas obviously if be interested in a sustainable cease fire need to stop arming and then of course country contingent to the gaza need to work to stop the smuggling and be a difficult difficult task mean there be tunnel and know great opportunity for people who want to continue to try to disrupt democracy to provide the weapon to do so second part of question please madam q do approve of the israeli conduct in this the president think israel have a right to defend obviously in any of these kind of situation would hope that would continue to be mindful of innocent folk and that help know expedite the delivery of humanitarian aid and third why have not achieve peace that be a good question be be a long time since have have peace in the|middle|east step one be to have a vision for what peace would look like and in on the step of the|rose|garden give a speech about a state solution state democracy live side by side in peace and have work hard to advance that idea first thing be to convince all party that the state be necessary for peace and thing that be happen be be that most people in the|middle|east now accept the state solution as the good way for peace most palestinians want own state and most israelis understand there need to be a democracy on border in order for there to be long last peace the challenge of course have be to lay out the condition so that a peaceful state can emerge in other word help the palestinians in the west|bank develop security force which have work hard to do over the|past|years and those security force be now become more efficient and prime minister fayyad be use effectively the challenge be to develop help the palestinians develop a democracy mean and a vibrant economy in that will help lead to democracy and the challenge of course be always complicate by the fact that people be willing to murder to stop the advance of freedom and so the hamas or for that matter al|qaeda or other extremist group be willing to use violence to prevent free state from emerge and that be the big challenge and so the answer be will this ever happen think will and know have advance the process yes suzanne finally get name right after how many|year six|year q eight|year laughter the president use to be know as suzanne now be suz ahn q suz ahn thank laughter the president be gahge laughter q in state of the union address identify u.s. threat as an axis of evil iran iraq and north|korea iraq be relatively calm north|korea be no longer on the terrorist threat list how would define if in fact there be an axis of evil and what be the great and most urgent threat when come to security that barack|obama have to deal with the president the most urgent threat that will have to deal with and other president after will have to deal with be an attack on homeland know wish could report that be not the case but there be still an enemy out there that would like to inflict damage on america americans and that will be the major threat north|korea be still a problem there be a debate in the intel community about how big a problem be but of concern be that there may be a highly enrich uranium program and therefore be really important that out of the party talk come a strong verification regime in other word in order to advance relation with north|korea the north|korean government must honor the commitment make to allow for strong verification measure to be in place to ensure that do not develop a highly enrich uranium program for example so be still dangerous and iran be still dangerous yes q say in an interview earlier|this|weekend of these guess exit interview that the president this be the ultimate exit interview q that think need to be more inclusive who need to hear that message inside the president see be concerned that in the wake of the defeat that the temptation will be to look inward and to say well here be a litmus test must adhere to this party will come back but the party 's message have get to be that different point of view be include in the party and take for example the immigration debate that be obviously a highly contentious issue and the problem with the outcome of the initial round of the debate be that some people say well republicans do not like immigrant now that may be fair or unfair but that be what that be the image that come out and know if the image be do not like immigrant then there be probably somebody else out there say well if do not like the immigrant probably do not like as well and so point be be that party have get to be compassionate and broad minded remember the election dad happen to be run for the|united|state|senate then and know get landslide with the johnson landslide in the state of texas but be not just george|bush who get defeat be pretty well decimate at the time at least that be what think that be how the pundit view and then there be a resurgence and the same thing can happen this time but just get to make sure message be broad gauged and compassionate that care about people 's life and have get a plan to help improve life jake yes how do q be good how do sir the president so what have be do since never mind laughter q work way to this chair the president so be go to be here for president obama q will will the president that be a pretty cool job q be not bad the president yes laughter q yours may be well the president yes what retirement laughter q in the past when have be ask to address bad poll number or own popularity have say that history will judge that do the right thing that think do the right thing but without get into motif or goal think a lot of people include republicans include some member of own administration have be disappoint at the execution of some of ideal whether iraq or katrina or the economy what would closing message be to the american people about the execution of these goal the president well first of all hard thing do not happen overnight jake and when the history of iraq be write historian will analyze for example the decision on the surge the situation be look like be go fine and then violence for a period of time begin to throw throw the progress of iraq into doubt and rather than accept the status quo and saying oh be not worth or the politic make difficult or know the party may end up be know not do well in the election because of the violence in iraq decide to do something about and send troop in as oppose to withdraw and so that part of history be certain and the situation do change now the question be in the long run will this democracy survive and that be go to be the challenge for future president in term of the economy look inherit a recession be end on a recession in the meantime there be of uninterrupted job growth and defend tax cut when campaign help implement tax cut when be president and will defend after presidency as the right course of action and there be a fundamental philosophical debate about tax cut who best can spend money the government or and have always side with the people on that issue now obviously these be very difficult economic time when people analyze the situation there will be this problem start before presidency obviously take place during presidency the question face a president be not when the problem start but what do do about when recognize the problem and readily concede chunk aside some of free market principle when be tell by chief economic advisor that the situation be face could be bad than the|great|depression so have tell some of friend who say know who have take an ideological position on this issue why do do what do say well if be sit there and hear that the depression could be great than the|great|depression hope would act too which do and have take extraordinary measure to deal with the frozen credit market which have affect the economy credit spread be begin to shrink lending be just begin to pick up the action have take believe have help thaw the credit market which be the first step toward recovery and so yes look there be plenty of critic in this business understand that and thank for give a chance to defend a record that be go to continue to defend because think be a good strong record jim q thank mr. president would also like to ask about critic the president sure know any laughter q well a|couple|years|ago charles|krauthammer columnist and harvard train psychiatrist coin a term bush derangement syndrome to talk about critic who disagree with most passionately not just policy but seem to take an animosity towards be just wonder as look back why think engender such passionate criticism animosity and do have any message specifically to those to that particular part of the spectrum of critic the president know most people see know when be move around the country for example be not angry and be not hostile people and never meet people who disagree that be just not true have meet a lot of people who do not agree with the decision make but have be civil in discourse and so view those who get angry and yell and say bad thing and know all that kind of stuff be just a very few people in the country do not know why get angry do not know why get hostile be not the first time however in history that people have express in sometimes undignified way have be read know a lot about during presidency and there be some pretty harsh discord when come to the 16th president just like there be be harsh discord for the 43rd president know president can try to avoid hard decision and therefore avoid controversy that be just not nature be the kind of person that know be willing to take on hard task and in time of war people get emotional understand that never really know spend that much time frankly worry about the loud voice of course hear but do not affect policy nor do affect affect how make decision know the president elect obama will find this too will get in the|oval|office and there will be a lot of people that be real critical and harsh and will be disappoint at time by the tone of the rhetoric and be go to have to do what think be right jim and if do not then do not see how can live with do not see how can get back home in texas and look in the mirror and be proud of what see if allow the loud voice the loud critic to prevent from do what think be necessary to protect this country mike q mr. president thank very much since philosophy be so different from president elect obama 's what concern the most about what may attempt to do the president know michael be not go to speculate about what be go to do be go to be know be go to get in the|oval|office be go to analyze each situation and be go to make the decision that think be necessary and the other thing be when get out of here be get off the stage believe there ought to be know person in the klieg light at a time and have have time in the klieg light know be confident know will catch opine on occasion but wish all the good and people say oh just that be just a throwaway line no be not a throwaway line the stake be high there be an enemy that still be out there know people can maybe try to write that off as know be try to set something up be tell there be an enemy that would like to attack america americans again there just be that be the reality of the world and wish all the very good and of course be go to have hand full with the economy understand be tough for a lot of work people out there the people be concerned about economic future know of the very difficult part of the decision make on the financial crisis be to use hardworke people 's money to help prevent there to be a crisis and in so do some of that money go into wall street firm that cause the crisis in the first place be not kid when say wall street get drunk and get the hangover and but nevertheless president elect obama will find the problem and the situation surround problem sometimes cause people to have to make decision that know be not initially comfortable with and there be such a decision when come to wall street mean have a lot of people when go out to midland that time say what the heck be do those people up east cause the problem say know but if have not work to fix the problem situation would be bad and anyway really do wish all the good sheryl q thank mr. president mr. president in recent|day there be be a fair amount of discussion in legal circle about whether or not may give preemptive pardon pardon in advance to official of administration who engage in anything from harsh interrogation tactic to perhaps dismiss u.s. attorney would like to know have give any consideration to this and be plan on the president will not be discuss pardon here at this press conference q can have a follow up the president would like to ask another question q yes would sir thank four|years|ago the president that be the spirit be not laughter q appreciate that the president thank laughter q four|years|ago be ask if have make any mistake the president yes q and be not try to play gotcha but wonder when look back over the long arc of presidency do think in retrospect that have make any mistake and if so what be the single big mistake that may have make the president gotcha have often say that history will look back and determine that which could have be do better or know mistake make clearly put a mission accomplished on a aircraft carrier be a mistake send the wrong message be try to say something differently but nevertheless convey a different message obviously some of rhetoric have be a mistake have think long and hard about katrina know could have do something differently like land air|force|one either in new|orleans or baton|rouge the problem with that and be that law enforcement would have be pull away from the mission and then question suspect would have be how could possibly have fly air|force|one into baton|rouge and police officer that be need to expedite traffic out of new|orleans be take off the task to look after believe that run the social|security idea right after the election be a mistake should have argue for immigration reform and the reason why be be that know of the lesson learn as governor of texas by the way be legislative branch tend to be risk adverse in other word sometimes legislature have the tendency to ask why should take on a hard task when a crisis be not imminent and the crisis be not imminent for social|security as far as many member of congress be concern as an aside thing prove be that can actually campaign on the issue and get elect in other word do not believe talk about social|security be the third rail of american politic matter of fact think that in the future not talk about how intend to fix social|security be go to be the third rail of american politic thing about the presidency be that can make only make decision know on the information at hand do not get to have information after have make the decision that be not the way work and stand by decision and do good to explain why make the decision make there have be disappointment abu|ghraib obviously be a huge disappointment during the presidency not have weapon of mass destruction be a significant disappointment do not know if want to call those mistake or not but be thing do not go accord to plan let put that way anyway think historian will look back and will be able to have a well look at mistake after some time have pass along jake 's question there be no such thing as short term history do not think can possibly get the full breadth of an administration until time have pass where do a president 's do a president 's decision have the impact that think would or think would over time or how do this president compare to future president give a set of circumstance that may be similar or not similar mean there be be just impossible to do and be comfortable with that yes mike q of the major objective that the incoming administration have talk frequently about be restore america 's moral standing in the world and many of the ally of the new president believe that the president elect have talk about the damage that gitmo that harsh interrogation tactic that consider torture how go to war in iraq without a u.n. mandate have damage america 's moral standing in the world be wonder basically what be reaction to that do think that be that something that the next president need to worry about the president strongly disagree with the assessment that moral standing have be damage may be damage amongst some of the elite but people still understand america stand for freedom that america be a country that provide such great hope go to africa ask africans about america 's generosity and compassion go to india and ask about know america 's view of america go to china and ask now no question part of europe have say that should not have go to war in iraq without a mandate but those be a few country most country in europe listen to what say which be disclose disarm or face serious consequence most people take those word seriously now some country do not even though may have vote for the resolution disagree with this assessment that know people view america in a dim light just do not agree with that and understand that gitmo have create controversy but when come time for those country that be criticize america to take some of those some of those detainee be not willing to help out and so know just disagree with the assessment mike will remind listen tell people yes can try to be popular in certain|quarter in europe can be popular by blame every middle|eastern problem on israel or can be popular by join the|international|criminal|court guess could have be popular by accept kyoto which feel be a flawed treaty and propose something different and more constructive and in term of the decision that have make to protect the homeland would not worry about popularity what would worry about be the|united|state and put plan in place that make easy to find out what the enemy be think because all these debate will matter not if there be another attack on the homeland the question will not be know be critical of this plan or not the question be go to be why do not do something do remember what be like right after september the 11th around here in press conference and opinion piece and in story that sometimes be news story and sometimes opinion piece people be say how come do not see how come do not connect the dot do remember what the environment be like in washington do when people be haul up in front of congress and member of congress be ask question about how come do not know this that or the other and then start put policy in place legal policy in place to connect the dot and all of a sudden people be say how come be connect the dot and so mike have hear all that have hear all that view be be that most people around the world respect america and some of do not like understand that some of the writer and the know opiner and all that that be fine that be part of the deal but be more concerned about the country and how people view the|united|state view as strong compassionate people who care deeply about the universality of freedom roger q thank mr. president speak a moment ago about use taxpayer ' money for the tarp program the president yes do q the first be out the door be be spend be satisfied that be be spend wisely and for the second that be under consideration do think be supportive of congress put some restriction on the president be supportive of the president elect work out a plan with congress that good suit and congress that be what be go to have to do be go to have to go up there and be go to have to make case as to why the be necessary and know that this be nothing new and in term of the first be pleased with this aspect of the expenditure and that be that the financial market be begin to thaw in the fall be concern that the credit freeze would cause to be head toward a depression great than the|great|depression that be what be tell if do not move and so therefore have move aggressively and by the way just be not with the tarp if think about aig fannie and freddie a lot of the decision that be make in this administration be very aggressive decision all aim at prevent the financial system from cratere q mr. president speak of the moment that the responsibility of the office would hit barack|obama the world be a far different place than be when hit when do think be go to feel the full impact and what if anything have and the other presidents share with about the effect of the sometimes isolation the so call bubble of the office the president yes that be a great question will will feel the effect the minute walk in the|oval|office at least that be when feel do not know when be go may feel the|minute be get swear in and the|minute get swear in start think about the speech laughter and so but be a well speech maker than so will be able to will be able to do not know how be go to feel all know be be go to feel there will be a moment when feel have never feel isolated and do not think will reason will not feel isolated be because be get a fabulous family and care a lot about family that be evident from discussion with will be be a 45-second commute away from a great wife and little girl that love dearly believe this the phrase burden of the office be overstate know be kind of like why oh the burden know why do the financial collapse have to happen on watch be just be pathetic be not self pity and do not believe that president elect obama will be full of self pity will find know the people that do not like the critic be pretty predictable sometimes the big disappointment will come from so call friend and there will be disappointment promise will be disappoint on the other hand the job be so exciting and so profound that the disappointment will be clearly know a minor irritant compare to the q be never the lonely office in the world for the president no not for have a people have a fabulous team around of highly dedicated smart capable people and have fun tell people that know some|days happy some|days not so happy every|day have be joyous and people say just do not believe to be the case well be the case even in the dark moment of iraq know there be and every day when be read the report about soldier lose life no question there be a lot of emotion but also there be time where could be light hearted and support each other and build a team of really capable people who be there not to serve or there to serve the republicans be there to serve the country and president elect obama will find as make these tough call and tough decision that will be support by a lot of really good people that care care about the country as well john q have talk a lot about concern over the rise of protectionism in the current the president yes q economic environment what do think the future hold for that do think the trend be a good or a bad one the president hope the trend be bad against protectionism a disappointment not a mistake but a disappointment be not get the trade bill out of congress on colombia panama and south|korea that be a disappointment actually think have a shot at time and then be disappoint that do not move out of the house and be concerned about protectionism in tough economic time the temptation be to say well let just throw up barrier and protect own and not compete that be the sentiment by the way that be in place during decent economic time after all get cafta out of the congress by vote and would be a huge mistake if become a protectionist nation and that may be a good thing for the bush center to do at smu be to remind people

whether be travel whether be the president know mike do not know probably the|next|day be a type a personality know just just can not envision know the big straw hat and hawaiian shirt sit on some beach laughter q no one else can either the president so laughter particularly since quit drink anyway so predict to that first of all be not sure what to expect for the|last|eight|years have have a national security briefing every|day but sunday and when get a national security briefing be a reminder of the responsibility of the job be just a daily reminder about what may or may not happen the interesting thing about this job by the way be be thing to deal with the expect what anticipate the real challenge be to be in a position to deal with the unexpected and that be why those intel briefing be so important because there be there be an awareness in the briefing by the analyst to try to help anticipate problem and of course hope do not arise but better be prepare when do and that in create a know get attention when start think about what could happen and the key there of course be that to take these different analysis seriously and then have a structure so that team will be in a position to analyze and then lay out potential avenue for the president from which the president can choose say all that because that be this have be this notion about be brief and think about this issue or that issue have be just a part of life for eight|year people say well there be in crawford on vacation never escape the presidency travel with everywhere go and there be not a moment where do not think about be president unless be rid mountain bike as hard as possibly can try to forget for the moment and so wake up in crawford tuesday morning mean wednesday|morning and suspect will make laura coffee and go get for and be go to be a different feeling and can not be kind of like will report back after feel last question ann since have be there from q thank and want to ask about day arrive here want to be a uniter not a divider do think barack|obama can be a uniter not a divider or be with the challenge for any president and the unpopular decision be impossible for any president to be uniter not a divider the president hope the tone be different for than have be for be disappoint by the tone in washington d.c. try to do part by not engage in the name calling and and by the way needless name calling have work to be respectful of opponent on different issue there do find some good common ground on a variety of issue no|child|left|behind medicare prescription drug pepfar in the end the funding for troop in iraq tax cut to a certain extent get some bipartisan vote on there have be area where be able to work together be just the rhetoric get out of control at time q why the president do not know why need to ask those who those who use the word use as say be not the first time be ever happen as think answer that to jim there be happen throughout history and would hope that frankly for the sake of the system that if people disagree with president elect obama treat with respect worry about people look at system and say why would want to go up there and work in that kind of environment and so wish all the good and no question will be there will be critic and there should be all should welcome criticism on different policy be the great thing about democracy people have a chance to express just hope the tone be respectful deserve and so do the country have be a honor to work with mean what say when first get up here wish all the very good wish and family all the
